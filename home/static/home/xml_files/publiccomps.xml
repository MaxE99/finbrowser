Zoom and Crowdstrike soared out of the IPO gates in mid-2019 with their 100% YoY growth rates and then their stock prices plunged in Q3'19 amidst fears that software buying was slowing down (&#8263;) and that the companies were highly overvalued.<br><br>It's worth reiterating why a company like Zoom trades for nearly 17.3x and, say, Uber trades for 3x--Zoom was growing 100%+YoY and now at 85% while demonstrating it can generate real cashflow with nearly 30% FCF margins in its most recent quarter. Whereas Uber is growing 30% YoY with -26% FCF (-$1B of cash burned in Q3'19). Zoom has an efficiency of nearly 115% and Uber 3.5% -- the Rule of 40 matters.<br><br>That said, the winner of the 2019 IPO is Beyond Meats which is a producer of plant-based foods growing 250% with -20% FCF margins at nearly 2x their IPO opening price. Time will tell how these companies fare overtime.<strong>&#128073;Takeaway:&nbsp;</strong>Most 2019 IPOs are still trading at 1x their&nbsp;IPO price. The biggest gains are Beyond Meat (2x), Ping Identity (1.3x) and&nbsp;biggest losses are Smile Direct Club (0.5x), Slack (0.6x), and Uber (0.8x).

Additionally, Bill.com services&nbsp;accounting firms (over 70+&nbsp;of the top 100 accounting firms) by helping them grow their book of business by automating bookkeeping tasks on behalf of customers. Banks also use Bill.com to provide their customers with a digital solution around cash flow management. The business also pitches itself as scaling with growing&nbsp;mid-size businesses like Hashicorp.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Pay Bills (Account Payable):&nbsp;</strong>Bill.com solves the pain point of&nbsp;customers having to manually send physical checks to pay for bills or track invoices and bills&nbsp;in filing cabinets. The company provides customers the option of paying via ACH, physical check or through a virtual credit card and if its an international vendor, Bill.com waives the international wire transfer fee.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Approval&nbsp;Workflow</strong>:&nbsp;Company's product can scan and digitize&nbsp;invoices in PDF and automatically generate a bill that kicks off the approval process by notifying the person who needs to approve the bill or invoice.</p></li><li><p><strong>Get Paid (Account Receivable)</strong>: Business also enables SMBs to send&nbsp;digital invoices to customers and sends automatic reminders to for customers to pay.</p></li><li><p><strong>ROI:&nbsp;</strong>The company claims to have cut down the processing time of paper bills and invoices for a customer from 3 days a month to 1 hour and to help customers get paid 2x faster. In some instances, customers claim to have saved on not having&nbsp;to hire a full-time accounts payable person given the 2,000+ bills they receive in a year.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Business Model:</strong>&nbsp;Bill.com makes most of its money from subscription&nbsp;-- business owners pay&nbsp;&nbsp;$40-$100/user/month-- and&nbsp;transaction fees from ACH processing, checks or invoices mailed,&nbsp;virtual card payments, etc.<br><br><strong>Go-to-market:&nbsp;</strong>Company acquires SMBs directly via online channels, word of mouth and trade shows. Additionally, Bill.com acquires customers indirectly via partnerships&nbsp;with 70+&nbsp;of the top 1000 accounting firms which then introduce Bill.com to their clients.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Competition:&nbsp;</strong>Bill.com has various competitors that go after SMBs from larger enterprises like SAP, Sage Intacct, and Netsuite but also startups like Expensify that focus mostly on receipt and expense management (and not necessarily invoices). The accounting software tools like Freshbooks, Xero, and Quickbooks also provide some sort of AP and AR management but don't seem to act as direct competitors.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Strengths</strong><br>&#128079;<strong>Growth:&nbsp;</strong>8th fastest-growing Public software company at 57% YoY and $140m revenue run rate (quarter revenue *4). Note the revenue isn't necessarily recurring software.<br>&#128079;<strong>Low Cash Burn:</strong>&nbsp;the business consumed nearly $190m of capital to get to $140m revenue run rate which is ok from a capital efficiency perspective and most recently is -4% FCF which is effectively cash flow break even.<br>&#128079;<strong>Gross Margins:&nbsp;</strong>margins are ~74% which is good but not necessarily amazing.<br><br><strong>Weaknesses</strong><br>&#129335;&#8205;&#9794;&#65039;<strong>Payback Period:&nbsp;</strong>While we have Bill.com as 2nd lowest payback period at 10 months using our 1/CAC Ratio methodology&nbsp;but the company does explicitly note that the average payback period in 2018 was&nbsp;15 months which is good but not best in class for a business servicing SMBs.<br>&#129335;&#8205;&#9794;&#65039;<strong>Net Dollar Retention:&nbsp;</strong>Moderate net dollar retention at 110%.

The company also provides logging, metrics, APM, and business analytics solutions and is the commercial entity behind&nbsp;the Elastic Stack which basically allows developers to ingest and store data (e.g user, log, metrics data) and to search, analyze or visualize data quickly.<br><br><strong>Competition:&nbsp;</strong><br>&#9876;&#65039;Search: Amazon Web Services Elastic Search Service (which uses Elastic's open source project but doesn't get the benefits of Elastic NV's proprietary feature set), Apache Solr (open source), Algolia ($40m revenue '18 and raised $110m on Oct '19)<br>&#9876;&#65039;Logging &amp; Security Analytics: Splunk, Microfocus ArcSight SIEM, Sumo Logic, Datadog<br>&#9876;&#65039;Metrics &amp; APM: New Relic, AppDynamics, Datadog<br><br><strong>Strengths</strong><br>&#128079;7th Fastest-Growing Public SaaS at 66% YoY ARR<br>&#128079;High Net Dollar Retention at &gt;130% &#8212; multiple offerings allows customers to use for app and site search + security + business analytics<br>&#129320;2nd lowest SaaS valuation (7.3x EV/NTM Revenue Run Rate &amp; 8.7x EV/2020 Revenue)<br><br><strong>Weaknesses</strong><br>&#128078;8th highest payback period at 20 months-- management investing heavily into S&amp;M in last 12 months (&gt;$20m+)<br>&#128078;2nd lowest operating income % at -51% but FCF is -1% for the most recent quarter (-10% FCF over last-twelve-month) with $300m on balance sheet<br><br><strong>10/2019 Earnings Takeaway &amp; Market's Obsession with Operating Loss?<br>&#128073;</strong>Elastic went down 12% after releasing its earnings press release for posting a -$50m operating loss for the Q2 2020 quarter or $0.64 loss per share. Analysts estimated $0.34 loss per share so the $0.64 loss per share was a shock. However, free cash flow for the quarter was -$1.4m or -1% FCF margin&nbsp;-- far lower than the -50% operating margin that seems troubling on face value<br><br>We don't believe the market focuses enough on free cash flow&nbsp;which accounts for a&nbsp;large amount of cash enterprise software companies collect upfront. We personally&nbsp;believe free cash flow is a better indicator of the profitability of SaaS companies as GAAP revenue doesn't account for large upfront contracts that companies like Elastic get from buyers (all the unrecognized revenue gets buried under deferred revenue). Cash is the lifeblood of a company and a better indicator of "runway":&nbsp;Elastic has over $300m in the bank and&nbsp;burning -$1.4m a quarter suggests&nbsp;the business isn't going to run out of cash anytime soon.<br><br>&#128073;Zoom is another example of the market potentially not focusing enough on free cash flow. The business reported 85% YoY growth rate in 2019Q3&nbsp;down considerably from 120% YoY in 2018Q3. Understandably analysts and investors were worried. GAAP Operating income was -$1.1 with -1% operating margins. However, on the free cash flow side, the 2019Q3 FCF margins are 33% up from -7% FCF % in 2018Q3. Putting that into context, Atlassian has ~30% FCF margins but now only grows about 36% YoY. ZM's stock price dropped nearly 11% post the earnings despite Zoom having the highest efficiency of 118% (using current FCF % instead of LTM FCF %) among all public software companies<br><br><strong>Bottom Line</strong>:&nbsp;Analyst and the market seem to be focused on operating income/loss which drives earnings per share when perhaps they should be focused on free cash per share which is a better representation of the enterprise software model.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://publiccomps.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Sign up now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://publiccomps.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Sign up now</span></a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dec '19 SaaS Index 📈  + Honey Acquisition 🍯]]></title><description><![CDATA[Performance of SaaS Index since 2014 and Why Paypal Bought Honey]]></description><link>https://publiccomps.substack.com/p/dec-19-saas-index-honey-acquisition</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://publiccomps.substack.com/p/dec-19-saas-index-honey-acquisition</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jon Ma]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2019 03:02:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe968920c-e350-4fff-9630-d598f3de52a5_1486x856.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#128075; SaaS Investor &amp; Builder &#128075; <br><br>Jon and Howard here &#128587;&#8205;&#9794;&#65039;. </p><p>We send newsletters to our paying customers on the overall SaaS market and analysis on an interesting Fintech, SaaS, or B2C Subscription company. </p><p>This week, we share our newsletters with all users of Public Comps and cover how the overall SaaS market is doing relative to other VC funds and why Paypal bought Honey.</p><h3>Key Takeaways </h3><p><strong>&#128073;Public SaaS Index Takeaway:&nbsp;</strong>In the last 5 years, if you invested in the Public Comps SaaS Index, you'd be&nbsp;up 3.3x with a&nbsp; ~27% IRR and perform better than the S&amp;P (~10%) and other top tier VC funds (10-23%) like KPCB, A16z, USV, etc of the same vintage year.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&#128073;Honey $4B Acquisition&nbsp;Takeaway: </strong>Our guess is that<strong> </strong>Paypal paid 20x 2019E revenue because it&#8217;s looking to differentiate from Apple Pay, Stripe, and Adyen&nbsp;on the merchant side by helping with user conversion and bringing Honey's 14 million MAU that are mostly millennials as potential customers.

Automatically finds and applies savings for consumers across 30k merchants via browser extension. Consumers get, say, 1-10% cash back in Honey reward points and can redeem for gift cards. Consumers win because know they got "a great deal". Merchants win because Honey helps convert consumers (67% are millennials which are valuable!) to buy from their e-commerce site. Honey wins because gets % of revenue from merchant for helping convert customer.</p></li><li><p>&#128293;<strong>Revenue:</strong> $100m net revenue 2018 growing 100% according to Paypal conference call</p></li><li><p>&#128588; <strong>HoneyUsers &amp; Benchmarks:</strong> 14m monthly active users (Fintech Benchmarks: Robinhood has 6m brokerage accounts '18, Dave 3.5m registered users, Chime 4m customers, Venmo 40m active users)</p></li><li><p>&#9996;&#65039;<strong>Merchants Partners:</strong><a href="http://Booking.com">Booking.com</a>, Dell, Sephora, Walmart, Macy, Hulu, Etsy, Kohls, Priceline, American Eagle, Expedia, etc.</p></li><li><p>&#128073;<strong>Employee:</strong> 350 employees so ~$285k revenue/employee &#128562;</p></li><li><p>&#9876;&#65039;<strong>Winner in Promo/Coupon Chrome Extn Market:</strong> Honey 10m+ downloads , Ebates 3m , Wikibuy 4.5m, Retailmenot ~400K.</p></li><li><p>&#128077;<strong>Capital Efficient:</strong> Profitable &amp; only raised $55m to date ($&gt;2 revenue : $1 raised!)</p></li><li><p>&#128176;<strong>Investors &#128079;:</strong> Anthos Capital, Mucker Capital, Cendana</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Public Comps Analysis</strong><br></h3><p>Acquisition Price: Paypal paid&nbsp;$4b in cash and with $100m net revenue in 2018, that's 40x 2018 Revenue.&nbsp;Assuming Honey doubled since 2018, business is ~$200m net revenue so the acquisition is&nbsp;<strong>20x EV/2019 Revenue</strong>. &#128562;<br><br>In comparison,</p><ul><li><p>Rakuten bought Ebates for<strong> 6x EV/net revenue</strong> (<a href="https://global.rakuten.com/corp/news/press/2014/0909_02.html">$1b on $164m net revenue</a>)</p></li><li><p>Paypal trades for <strong>6.7x EV/2019 Revenue.</strong></p></li><li><p>Zoom and Datadog trade for <strong>24 and 22x EV/2020 Revenue</strong> respectively (though Honey is definitely NOT a B2B SaaS company and shouldn't be comped to these set of companies)</p></li></ul><p> Needless to say, <em>Paypal decided to pay top &#128181;f</em>or Honey so it's important to understand why they did.<br><br><strong>Why did Paypal Buy Honey?&nbsp;</strong></p><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f0cf24-a288-4ec2-bb34-46506d77d8dc_1578x832.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f0cf24-a288-4ec2-bb34-46506d77d8dc_1578x832.png" width="1100" height="580" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/07f0cf24-a288-4ec2-bb34-46506d77d8dc_1578x832.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:580,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f0cf24-a288-4ec2-bb34-46506d77d8dc_1578x832.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f0cf24-a288-4ec2-bb34-46506d77d8dc_1578x832.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f0cf24-a288-4ec2-bb34-46506d77d8dc_1578x832.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f0cf24-a288-4ec2-bb34-46506d77d8dc_1578x832.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><ul><li><p><strong>Paypal's Business Model: </strong>Paypal is really a&nbsp;two-sided marketplace by facilitating online payments between merchants and consumers. Its primary business model is taking 2.9% of the&nbsp;transaction from merchants for successfully facilitating online payments between the 24m+ merchants and Paypal's&nbsp;over 295m users. Consumers pay nothing. The more consumers that have a Paypal account, the more likely merchants are to sign up for Paypal as an easy means to accept online payments.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Paypal and the threat of Stripe, Adyen, Apple Pay:&nbsp;</strong>Paypal is facing stronger competition with Stripe (SME), Adyen (Enterprise), and Square (Merchant POS) wrestling with them for merchants. Adyen is ~$460m net revenue last 12 months growing 41% with 56% EBITDA&nbsp; margins (!) with a $22.3b enterprise value. Stripe just raised at $35b valuation and assuming a similar ~48x EV/Net Revenue, Stripe is likely in the ballpark of $730m net revenue likely growing in the 40% YoY range. These online payment processors differentiate by providing better developer experiences (e.g Stripe vs Paypal Braintree), lower cost (e.g Adyen vs Braintree), or having a particular market focus (Stripe in SME vs Adyen in Enterprise). On the consumer and P2P side, Paypal &amp; Venmo are competing with Square Cash and Apple Pay for better consumer buying experiences. If a consumer had the choice between using Apple Pay (+ Apple Card with 3% cashback) to pay for an online product on their mobile device or having to remember their password and sign onto Paypal, the consumer would likely choose the Apple Pay&nbsp;(and displacing usage of Paypal!).</p></li><li><p><strong>Owning Product Discovery&nbsp;through&nbsp;Check-Out: </strong>I suspect Paypal acquired Honey to change the user flow of how users are discovering products (traditionally via Google Search, Instagram, Youtube, or Amazon), comparing prices &amp; deals (Google Search, Amazon, Daily Deal websites) and then ultimately purchasing with Paypal checkout. The implication is Paypal has a&nbsp;truly unique value prop that Square, Stripe, Adyen, Apple Pay don't have for acquiring consumers: giving "deal hunting" Millennials the perceived "best deal" possible which would drive payment conversion and therefore help merchants with the costly cart abandonment problem.&nbsp;The sell to merchants is this: instead of paying Facebook or Google as part of CAC, Paypal/Honey will bring users to you (Honey has over 14m) and will even drive down card abandonment rates because millennial users will feel like they have the best possible deal at check out and click "Buy with Paypal". To my knowledge, the other online payment players don't offer anything close to this.</p></li><li><p><strong>Monetizing Venmo and Paypal Consumers: </strong>Venmo currently has 40m+ users growing total payment volume 73% YoY with $300m of revenue. Paypal has over 295m total active accounts.&nbsp;Honey in comparison has 14m monthly active users and&nbsp;likely ~$200m&nbsp;revenue which implies Honey makes&nbsp;$14 net revenue per MAU in affiliate fees. Given Honey's value prop to users is "we save you money", I wouldn't be surprised if &gt;30% or 12m+ Venmo users download and use Honey which would drive an additional $170m of net revenue for Venmo. The same logic could apply for Paypal and a 10% conversion rate would be 30m+ new users for Honey which would be an additional $420m of net revenue. An incremental of $600m net revenue from just plugging in Honey to Paypal's user base would imply ~$800m net revenue for Honey in 2020. That makes the $4b price point look a lot more reasonable!</p></li></ul><p><strong>Sources</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/honey-app-ryan-hudson-2017-10">https://www.businessinsider.com/honey-app-ryan-hudson-2017-10</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://investor.paypal-corp.com/static-files/b6086399-6750-4bec-966c-8ebf768451d3">https://investor.paypal-corp.com/static-files/b6086399-6750-4bec-966c-8ebf768451d3</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/12/chime-has-quadrupled-its-customer-base-to-4-million-in-a-single-year.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/12/chime-has-quadrupled-its-customer-base-to-4-million-in-a-single-year.html</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://tearsheet.co/podcasts/banking-for-humans-dave-launches-credit-building-banking-for-its-3-5m-users/">https://tearsheet.co/podcasts/banking-for-humans-dave-launches-credit-building-banking-for-its-3-5m-users/</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://investor.paypal-corp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paypal-reports-third-quarter-2019-results">https://investor.paypal-corp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paypal-reports-third-quarter-2019-results</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.inc.com/emily-canal/stripe-2018-company-of-the-year-nominee.html">https://www.inc.com/emily-canal/stripe-2018-company-of-the-year-nominee.html</a></p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Insights for the best SaaS investors & operators]]></title><description><![CDATA[Welcome to Public&#8217;s Newsletter by me, Public Comps.
