Especially after the pandemic, the adoption only got faster. It even caught up to the people that were not tech-savvy and were still fighting the trend. One of those &#8220;fighters&#8221; was my mom. Because of work from home and the everyday use of apps to go to places and show your vaccine certificate, she had to adapt and get a smartphone, and she actually knows what Zoom is now. But what was so interesting for me was watching her adoption curve. In a few weeks, she went from only using the smartphone for these &#8220;necessities&#8221; and calling it a device that makes people more stupid to using the smartphone now in her spare time (solving crossword puzzles on the phone, watching the weather, news, etc.).</p><p>The inevitable thing is that our lives will be even more affected by technology in the coming years than now. And one of the strongest trends in tech is the adoption of the cloud and the high need for chips, sensors, and GPUs to power all the gadgets, items, and apps we use daily.</p><p>And here we come to the backbone of the whole tech world: computing platforms and chip designers/manufacturers. Without them, nothing would work.</p><p>Because of the recent chip shortage that has been going on for almost two years now, cloud computing companies saw how dependant they are on the chip providers to continue to grow their datacenters and power their computing platforms. With the fact that companies like Nvidia and AMD mainly do not manufacture their own chips and GPUs but rather design them and outsource the manufacturing part, cloud computing platforms from companies like Amazon, Google, Alibaba, and others started to skip the design companies and went to the manufacturers directly in their ambitions and efforts to build their own chips. </p><p>If we also look at the chip and GPU designers like Nvidia, they are also starting to get more hungry with their saturated market and began exploring options to increase their TAM and provide other services such as computing services.</p><p><strong>The semiconductor market</strong></p><p>For the base understanding of the chip market, we have three types of companies:</p><ul><li><p>chip designers</p></li><li><p>chip manufacturers</p></li><li><p>hybrids</p></li></ul><p>While most people know this by now, many companies, whom we perceive as chip manufacturers, are actually chip designers. Examples are Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm. The chip designers design the chips, but the manufacturing is outsourced to chip manufacturers/foundries. The main reason for this arrangement is that chip manufacturing requires constant high investments in building the foundry (manufacturing process, equipment &amp; plant) in keeping up with the newest, smallest, and most effective chips. It is still essential to understand that chip designing is a complex and high CAPEX (Capital intensive) business in itself and that designers and manufacturers usually have long-term and strong relationships.</p><p>Chip manufacturers are the companies that manufacture the chip. Two of the most important chip manufacturers globally are Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Even if we look at chip manufacturing on a country level &#8211; Taiwan and South Korea represent 80% of the global chip manufacturing. With the chip shortage and understanding the importance of chips on the whole economy, countries like the US and China are pushing to increase and build up their homegrown chip manufacturing.</p><p>Then we also have hybrids. These are the companies that design and manufacture their own chips. An example of this is Intel. They both design and manufacture their own chips. But the company has had trouble catching up with competition because they fall behind on their technology of developing 7nm and 5nm nodes.</p><p>To understand how Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) intensive it is running a chip Foundry we can look at CAPEX spend of the three key players for the last years:</p><p>2021 CAPEX of Foundry:</p><ul><li><p>Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) $28.5B</p></li><li><p>Intel $18.3B</p></li><li><p>Samsung Foundry $8.6B</p></li></ul><p>And the CAPEX looks even crazier when you look at estimates from these companies for this year:</p><ul><li><p>TSMC almost $33.9B</p></li><li><p>Intel $26.2B</p></li><li><p>Samsung Foundry $11.9B</p></li></ul><p>For comparison, the combined CAPEX spend of all three companies in 2019 was $35.1B, and now we are talking about only company - TSMC spending almost that combined amount in 2022.</p><p><strong>Market share</strong></p><p>To understand the market share, we first have to break down the market to chip manufacturers (Foundries) and then to CPU and GPU designers.</p><p>In terms of Chip manufacturing, the recent estimates are the following:</p><ul><li><p>TSMC &#8211; 54% market share</p></li><li><p>Samsung &#8211; 17% market share</p></li><li><p>UMC &#8211; 7% market share</p></li><li><p>Global Foundries &#8211; 7% market share</p></li><li><p>SMIC &#8211; 5% market share</p></li></ul><p>So, in reality, we can see that the two companies control almost the whole chip manufacturing market.</p><p>When we come to the market share of GPUs, we have to differentiate between integrated GPUs in computers where Intel owns the market and so-called &#8220;stand-alone&#8221; or discrete GPUs where Nvidia and AMD own the market (although Intel is about to enter this market now as well). In the discrete GPU market, Nvidia has 83%, and AMD has 17% of the market share.</p><p><strong>Why is there a shortage?</strong></p><p>To put it as briefly as I can, it&#8217;s a consequence of the pandemic and bad planning. When the pandemic started, it was a total shock to the whole economy, with the worldwide lockdowns. Factories that produce chips were affected by the lockdowns as well. And in the first early days of the pandemic, consumers were insecure. Everybody was expecting that consumers would act more scared and that consumer sentiment would fall. But after a few weeks, the opposite happened.</p><p>Because of the pandemic, consumers started buying a lot more IT stuff. From computers to gaming consoles and all other IT gadgets. The main driver was, of course, working from home, and people being bored in lockdowns, that's why they started to play many video games, watch movies, etc. Because of this massive demand for new IT gadgets, the need for chips soared. Months later, consumers expanded from just buying IT gadgets to buying cars, etc. The helicopter money (fiscal stimulus) helped lift consumer sentiment, so people started buying everything. And nowadays many products including cars have many chips in them. Businesses also migrated their IT infrastructure to the cloud, because it is easier to manage your workforce and work with clients with your IT infrastructure in the cloud. Again causing more demand for data centers and computing services that need many chips. Then came the third wave. Soaring prices of cryptocurrencies.  Again, as we saw in 2017, this lead to the increased demand for chips from cryptocurrencies miners.</p><p>So the significant, unprecedented demand for products together with the world&#8217;s soaring demand for adopting technology resulted in a world chip shortage. The fact that 80% of world chip production comes from two countries didn&#8217;t help (Taiwan and South Korea).</p><p>And because this demand hasn&#8217;t really reduced when the economies are still faced with waves and waves of new covid strains and because building new foundries takes at least two years to set up, we are still facing the shortage. Given the past experience of demand-supply cycles, chip manufacturers are also hesitant to build too much supply as they are afraid of the bullwhip effect. Today, everybody is overordering their chip orders because if they stated the actual amount of chips they need, they would not get the order filled anyway. So they overstate. But this results in skewed orders and an overstated demand for chips.</p><p>The shortage is not affecting all industries equally, though. The gaming providers are better off because of their longstanding relationships with the foundries, while an industry like auto manufacturers is having a more challenging time because they are relatively new customers to the chip manufacturers and do not have yet close longstanding relationships.</p><p><strong>Is Moore&#8217;s law dead?</strong></p><p>In 1965 Gordon Moore observed that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit would double every 18 months. He later revised that to 24 months. Three years later, he co-founded Intel, and his observation was the benchmark for the semiconductor industry for decades. This &#8220;law&#8221; is important because it basically meant that approximately every two years, personal computers and other tech devices could do twice as many new and unexpected things as before. But the problem is the size. The primary method has been to make transistors and the wires that are transmitted smaller and smaller. But when you have smaller and at the same time faster components on a computer chip, it will generate more heat and potentially melt.</p><p>While I wouldn&#8217;t call Moore&#8217;s law dead just now, it is definitely slowed down a lot since we have a limited way to go in terms of shrinking the size of chips, the production is getting costlier with every new generation, and at the same time, we are limited with the speed of light. We will bump into Heisenberg&#8217;s uncertainty principle. And because of this slowdown, you can understand that the chip designers are starting to look for new segments on where growth will come from.</p><p><strong>Cloud computing platforms</strong></p><p>Computing platforms are the second backbone of the software world. Their main goal for their customers is to provide the environment and resources in which software can be executed. They make it so that their customers do not have to build expensive IT hardware infrastructure and are one of the primary reasons why so many young companies that have SaaS business models can get started and can scale.</p><p>The biggest cloud computing platforms in the world are AWS from Amazon, Azure from Microsoft, Google Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud.</p><p><strong>What services do they offer?</strong></p><p>We can break down the services these platforms offer into four categories:</p><ol><li><p>Storage &#8211; storing data</p></li><li><p>Computing services &#8211; lending out computing power (CPU, GPU, etc.)</p></li><li><p>Networking services &#8211; Virtual routers, load balancers, VPN, etc.</p></li><li><p>Other SaaS services &#8211; various SaaS services like Elastic search, APIs to help with AI models, some are owned by the platforms some are offered from their software partners)</p></li></ol><p>But the important thing to note is that while Storage and Networking services are great business segments with stellar growth projections for the coming years, the computing service and Other SaaS services are where the real growth will come next.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43f5febc-39d1-4947-8338-0e572eb3a413_602x314.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43f5febc-39d1-4947-8338-0e572eb3a413_602x314.png" width="602" height="314" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/43f5febc-39d1-4947-8338-0e572eb3a413_602x314.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:314,&quot;width&quot;:602,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:190307,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43f5febc-39d1-4947-8338-0e572eb3a413_602x314.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43f5febc-39d1-4947-8338-0e572eb3a413_602x314.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43f5febc-39d1-4947-8338-0e572eb3a413_602x314.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43f5febc-39d1-4947-8338-0e572eb3a413_602x314.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>It is a trend that has already emerged that is why you see more cloud computing giants offering their own versions of popular SaaS services as they want a position themselves where the growth and profit will come for the coming years. Services such as MongoDB, Elastic search, etc.</p><p>The fight for having the best computing platform is also a big one and is already in the works. With the world turning more online and with the Metaverse concept, the need for computing increases exponentially, and the need for computing platforms with it.</p><p>Since the companies do not break down the profitability and revenue of each service inside the cloud unit, it is harder to get an accurate state of the market and the segments. Still based on estimations from different industry insiders, here is an interesting overview of the market leader AWS and the breakdown of their services.</p><p>It is estimated that AWS still makes about 70% of its revenue from two of its basic services. Storing (called S3 and EBS) and computing (called EC2). For the EC2 product, the gross margin is expected to be in the range of 50&#8217;s, and for S3, the gross margin is in the range of 50-70%. But what has constantly been growing in terms of % of revenue is the &#8220;other SaaS services&#8221; segment, which has a higher margin. But with the SaaS segment, we need to understand two business models. One is where AWS offers its own SaaS service to the client, and the other is where the clients use third-party SaaS services through the AWS marketplace. Estimations are that AWS charges an average 5% fee on listings. The marketplace fees are considerably lower than what companies like Apple and Google charge in their app stores, where the fees are as high as 30%. For its Azure cloud platform in the summer of last year, Microsoft reduced its marketplace fee from 20% to 3%, showing a considerable willingness to compete in this important market segment for the future.</p><p><strong>What is the market share of the sector like?</strong></p><p>The market is dominated by Big Tech players that have big pockets to be able to fuel the investments:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a96fe22-82c5-463e-934a-95c4bcd4c046_480x466.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a96fe22-82c5-463e-934a-95c4bcd4c046_480x466.png" width="480" height="466" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4a96fe22-82c5-463e-934a-95c4bcd4c046_480x466.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:466,&quot;width&quot;:480,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:221879,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a96fe22-82c5-463e-934a-95c4bcd4c046_480x466.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a96fe22-82c5-463e-934a-95c4bcd4c046_480x466.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a96fe22-82c5-463e-934a-95c4bcd4c046_480x466.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a96fe22-82c5-463e-934a-95c4bcd4c046_480x466.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">source: Statista</figcaption></figure></div><p>The dominant platforms are AWS from Amazon with 32% market share, Microsoft Azure with 20% market share (although they are now probably catching up to AWS), and Google Cloud with 9% market share.</p><p>They are followed by Alibaba Cloud, IBM, Salesforce, Tencent cloud, Oracle, and companies like Digital Ocean.</p><p><strong>The Clash</strong></p><p>Now let&#8217;s get to the heart of it all: the clash between chip designers and computing platforms.</p><p>Back in the day, there was a straightforward exchange happening.

A very clear relationship between what each party offers in terms of services and who the buyer &amp; supplier is.

Arm holdings sell/licenses chip designs, which computing platforms can then use to order the custom chips directly from foundries (skipping the traditional chip designers). Arm Holding is the company that Nvidia wanted to buy from Softbank but didn&#8217;t get regulatory approval. I am sure now you all understand why Nvidia wanted to own this company so badly and what it would mean for Nvidia. If they were successful with the deal, they would have successfully &#8220;hedged&#8221; their business and benefit in &#8220;every way&#8221; the market would develop.</p><p>While most computing platforms explain this move to go direct to Foundries because they want more custom fit chips for their data centers to better power AI training and stuff like that, I view this as only the first step for them. Computing platforms will want more and more of their chips to be built in-house to control this vital part of their service and increase their profits. A lot of the reasons why computing platforms can also do this is because they have bigger market caps and have larger amounts of capital at disposal than the chip designers.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25f2314e-d18e-49ff-a24b-9281b55b93a7_1379x973.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25f2314e-d18e-49ff-a24b-9281b55b93a7_1379x973.png" width="1379" height="973" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/25f2314e-d18e-49ff-a24b-9281b55b93a7_1379x973.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:973,&quot;width&quot;:1379,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:122672,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25f2314e-d18e-49ff-a24b-9281b55b93a7_1379x973.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25f2314e-d18e-49ff-a24b-9281b55b93a7_1379x973.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25f2314e-d18e-49ff-a24b-9281b55b93a7_1379x973.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25f2314e-d18e-49ff-a24b-9281b55b93a7_1379x973.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">source: <a href="https://ycharts.com?utm_source=Rihard-Jarc&amp;utm_medium=Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=Rihard-Jarc-Q12022">Ycharts</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>When looking at the Cash on the Balance sheets of companies like Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft, we can see how big of a difference it is compared to chip designers like Nvidia and AMD.

They are the most important manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet lithography machines that are used in the production of chips. And because of their next-generation machines that have previously unattainable levels of precision, they have entirely cornered the market. Each machine costs roughly $150 million and is the size of a bus. The company and its machines are among the most important assets in the semiconductor industry and manufacturing process. And as you may expect, ASML, because of its role, is not a small company. In fact, it is one of the top 5 biggest European companies by market cap at $258B.</p><p><strong>Chip designers also have bigger ambitious</strong></p><p>The other side of the clash between chip designers and computing platforms is because of chip designers. Companies like Nvidia have now seen that they too can skip the &#8220;middleman&#8221; in their process, which is the computing platform, and offer computing services powered by their GPUs directly to developers. An example of this is Nvidia&#8217;s recent Omniverse platform and its&#8217; Deep Learning Inference Platforms.</p><p>For those of you who do not know what the Nvidia Omniverse platform is yet, this short video summarizes their efforts very well:</p><div id="youtube2-xC6cho2VL6c" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;xC6cho2VL6c&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xC6cho2VL6c?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>While the Omniverse platform is still primarily used for rendering and 3D simulation, you can see that this is not the end goal and that a full-scale computing platform is the end goal. And with so many big tech companies acknowledging that the metaverse, AR, and 3D is the next computing platform, you can understand that the big computing platforms won&#8217;t leave this space untouched and will want their piece of the pie.</p><p>The other big platform Nvidia is building is the Deep Learning &amp; Inference platform, which is already in direct competition with the big cloud computing offerings. Inference is a term used in the software AI space as a process of taking an AI model trained beforehand (for example, with deep learning methods) and deploying that model onto a device that will process incoming data to enhance itself and make the algorithm more accurate. It is essential in the process called at the Edge. This means that data needs to be processed in real-time, and the AI model needs to produce results as fast as possible. That is why with Edge processing, the data isn&#8217;t transferred to the cloud to be processed, but instead, there is usually a low-power computer with an integrated inference accelerator, close to the source of data so that the results get processed as fast as possible.</p><p>Inference will be used more and more in the future as good AI models will need to receive and train from new incoming data and modify constantly. Also, processing at the Edge is a fast-growing field, especially with the Autonomous driving business segment where microseconds decision can make a life-changing difference.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>So, if you are asking yourself why it is important to understand this dynamic happening in the semiconductor and computing space, let me give you the answer. It is important to understand this even though right now we have a chip shortage, and it might seem to investors that every company in the semiconductor space is a great idea. I believe it is imperative to understand where the industry is going and not where it is now. All that said, I think these two sectors will, in the end, merge and form a &#8220;super&#8221; chip computing company. These companies will control both aspects of the business (chip design and a computing platform) because it makes sense from a position of power/control and a profit standpoint. As an investor, It is wise to think about which companies will come &#8220;on top&#8221; and which will have problems because of this new order.</p><p>If you haven&#8217;t yet, feel free to subscribe to this free newsletter &amp; share.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://uncoveralpha.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://uncoveralpha.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://uncoveralpha.substack.com/p/the-inevitable-tech-clash-chip-designers?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://uncoveralpha.substack.com/p/the-inevitable-tech-clash-chip-designers?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p></p><p>Also, if you liked some of the charts in the article, they were made by the <a href="https://ycharts.com?utm_source=Rihard-Jarc&amp;utm_medium=Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=Rihard-Jarc-Q12022">Ycharts</a> tool.

This article is not a company or asset breakdown but my view on an emerging trend with significant potential to become the next computing platform after the smartphone. Yes, you guessed it, the Metaverse.</p><p>I always loved the potential of AR and VR, as you can see from my first articles on Facebook (now Meta), where I was excited about their Facebook Reality Labs segment. This year I took a step deeper and really explored what the so-called Metaverse could be like and what assets could be interesting to own as an investor in this space.</p><p>Before we get started, let me emphasize that I am not an expert in this topic or have the full technical knowledge to explain the technical details. I am just sharing my view from my standpoint as a fundamental driven investor who invests in many emerging trends.</p><p>You may know from me already that I do not invest in things without utility, so for example, I missed out on all the meme stuff (from crypto to stocks like GME and AMC). And honestly, I am not upset about that because it doesn&#8217;t really fit my investing style, although super happy for all the people that made fortunes and changed their lives. I need to own things with utility so that I can value them appropriately. Owning things without utility just makes me nervous and without a strategy which in the end = me holding the bag and going to zero.</p><p><strong>First, let&#8217;s start with a short introduction of what the metaverse concept is all about.</strong></p><p>If you go on Google and type verb metaverse, you get:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;The term metaverse was coined in Neal Stephenson's 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash, where humans, as avatars, interact with each other and software agents, in a three-dimensional virtual space that uses the metaphor of the real world.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Sounds scary.</p><p>The term &#8220;metaverse&#8221; was first used in science fiction novels. It combines the word &#8220;universe&#8221; with the prefix &#8220;meta,&#8221; which comes from a Greek word meaning &#8220;beyond.&#8221; You could say that the first &#8220;virtual world&#8221; started years ago in gaming. Games that allowed their players to interact with each other in a virtual world appeared around the start of the new millennium, along with the advent of the Internet. These metaversal games were exceedingly popular. Games like There, RuneScape, and Second Life. Hell, even I played Runescape.</p><p>The second wave of games followed, with some earning massive numbers of users. The popularity of Roblox, Minecraft, Fortnite &amp; many others. But while these games boast global fanbases; allow players to create, sell/buy items in a virtual world and share experiences with thousands of people, they remain inherently centralized. With that, I mean you cannot transfer your items, avatars, and other digital items and take them with you into another world or game, if you will. They are in some way still a closed ecosystem where the companies owning the games decide the rules, economics, and profit the most from what the users create and develop. The Metaverse concept is now seen as a more open ecosystem with the users &amp; creators having the most significant economic benefit and the &#8220;provider&#8221; of the platform a smaller piece of the pie. There is also an expectation of having the real world more interconnected to this digital world through AR features and holograms so that the Metaverse doesn&#8217;t feel entirely like a computer game.</p><p><strong>Ok, but how will the Metaverse look like? What will we be able to do?</strong></p><p>Since this concept is relatively new and is in a fast-paced environment where things can change very quickly, what we see as the Metaverse of the future today will undoubtedly be very different when it actually happens.</p><p>I see the Metaverse as a kind of mix between reality and virtual reality. I imagine you can go fully VR with a headset and be represented as an avatar or other fictional character or even a 3D representation of yourself in a virtual world and do activities from work to entertainment. On the other hand, I think an even bigger part of the Metaverse will be the AR (augmented reality) segment. It means that you will see holograms and projections popping up on your smart glasses in the real world. It will enhance the real-world experience with more data. I guess it is a bit scary to think about it as it edges toward having a second life. I think this video when Facebook announces its vision for the Metaverse is a very plastic presentation of some of the concepts:</p><div id="youtube2-gElfIo6uw4g" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;gElfIo6uw4g&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gElfIo6uw4g?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>Now leaving my personal biased aside as to if I genuinely want the world to go into full Metaverse, I think this is the reality we are going to. And as such, from an investor standpoint, I see enormous potential in this new digital economy. The assets and companies forming this new world could benefit extremely from its adoption and broad economic effects.</p><p>Just to name some main areas where I see people using the Metaverse:</p><ul><li><p>Working. The pandemic changed the perception of working. Many jobs are now remote jobs and will stay remote even when it&#8217;s finally over. One of the main tools for doing work from home is video calls and apps such as Zoom, Teams, etc. But the problem with all these tools is that they are not quite immersive enough. People can&#8217;t communicate their ideas and thoughts in the same way. And this is what the Metaverse can change. With holograms, you will be able to see the other co-worker or client in a 3D image. You will be able to see not only the picture of the person you are talking to but also his gestures and the movement of his body to some degree. The presentations will also be more interactive and easy to do as they will not be limited to the current &#8220;let me share my desktop screen with you&#8221; concept. I believe the adoption here will happen quite fast as people that will stay and work remotely after the pandemic will want and need these tools to be more effective and productive, not to mention it does add a fun factor to the whole thing.</p></li><li><p>Entertainment. With entertainment, we can already see some adoption going on in the Metaverse with concerts. Tomorrowland, one of the biggest electronic music festivals, hosted its concert 100% in the Metaverse this year. Performers and artists are all looking into possibilities into how to do a show in the metaverse. Snoop Dogg partnered with a Metaverse land company called Sandbox and bought virtual land to have a space for his fans, including making concerts in the Metaverse. But the entertainment aspect is bigger than just concerts; it&#8217;s also gaming, it&#8217;s watching movies, hanging with your friends and visiting virtual places, etc.</p></li><li><p>Another area where adoption could rise fast is non-work-related communication. With that, I mean people from all over the world will be able to meet and see their friends &amp; family not only via a screen with a Zoom call but actually in 3D holograms, and they will be able to talk with a more immersive experience. This adoption could happen quite fast as it benefits the users in a better way to talk and meet.</p></li></ul><p><strong>The Facebook/Meta announcement is like gas on the fire!</strong></p><p>Now the concept of the Metaverse was out there for quite some time. I followed the AR and VR segments for quite some time, but my mind was stuck thinking that AR would be huge because it would enhance the real world, and I thought of VR as more of a gaming thing (like the next level PlayStation or something). Getting to know the Metaverse concept opened my mind as it joins VR and AR in an all-around experience. When I started to dive deeper into it was when I read Packy Mccormick&#8217;s <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/the-value-chain-of-the-open-metaverse">piece</a> in January 2021</p><p>So the concept was out there, BUT. What changed the whole landscape was on the 28th of October when Facebook (now Meta) had this big event announcing they would rename the company to Meta and spend $10B annually for years to come to help build the Metaverse. Their video presentation of the Metaverse is when I think most people started to realize how this thing could look and how big of a deal it is.</p><p>Facebook started this big domino effect, and suddenly all the big tech CEOs began talking about the Metaverse (from Microsoft, Disney to Nvidia and many others). And not only in the public markets, but you could also see how people were starting to pile big money into crypto assets that were associated with this so-called Metaverse.</p><p>Looking back, I think the moment Facebook made this big announcement was when the Metaverse started gaining mainstream attention.</p><p><strong>So how am I investing in this space right now? Is it investible?</strong></p><p>While the space is very young, I have started to build a part of my portfolio around some assets and companies that I think could be very important in this digital ecosystem.</p><p>To better understand what assets and segments I am looking at, I draw this diagram.</p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f05403-1571-4653-8c48-731233f6bf30_602x334.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f05403-1571-4653-8c48-731233f6bf30_602x334.png" width="602" height="334" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/88f05403-1571-4653-8c48-731233f6bf30_602x334.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:334,&quot;width&quot;:602,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:87805,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f05403-1571-4653-8c48-731233f6bf30_602x334.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f05403-1571-4653-8c48-731233f6bf30_602x334.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f05403-1571-4653-8c48-731233f6bf30_602x334.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f05403-1571-4653-8c48-731233f6bf30_602x334.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>It represents what I am currently seeing in the market as potential assets to keep an eye on. This diagram is probably missing a lot of other segments and companies, as there are thousands of companies developing and working in this space. This is just how I see it right now, so don&#8217;t get upset about it. &#128521;</p><p>As you can see, there are the following segments:</p><ul><li><p>Hardware</p></li><li><p>Engines</p></li><li><p>Protocols</p></li><li><p>Service infrastructure providers</p></li><li><p>Space/Land</p></li><li><p>AR tools</p></li><li><p>Digital items</p></li><li><p>Software tools for creators</p></li></ul><p></p><ol><li><p><strong>Hardware</strong></p></li></ol><p>As with any computing platform, the hardware is very important. We are talking about the VR or AR hardware for the people to enter the Metaverse and have a more immersed experience, and the other part is the CPU, and GPU providers that make the devices run and the data centers run. The main chip and GPU manufacturers for me seem to be Nvidia, AMD, and Qualcomm. Both Nvidia and AMD might come to mind to many investors as they have been discussed many times, but I added Qualcomm to my list as well, as its CPU Snapdragon powers Oculus Quest 2, for example.</p><p>From a user hardware perspective, so far, Meta (formerly FB) seems to have the edge with the Oculus Quest 2 VR headset that is starting to gain some serious mainstream traction. Just this month, it appears that Qualcomm CEO has intentionally or not slipped the number of Oculus Quest 2 sold, and that number is 10 million! The last number we had was from over the summer when Meta did a voluntary recall, and that number was 4 million headsets sold.</p><p>If we go to the AR space, I think Meta will dominate this field too.&nbsp; Their first product launch with RayBan Smart Glasses has potential. While the Smart Glasses do not offer any actual AR experience yet, they show me a few important features. One is that Meta went to partner with Luxottica, the sunglasses manufacturer that owns famous glasses brands like Ray-Ban and the other is that the Smart Glasses are super thin and light. This shows me that Meta understands that for AR to take off the Smart Glasses need to look &amp; feel like ordinary glasses, as people will not want to walk around the world looking like an alien.</p><div id="youtube2-qISv4FUjE84" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;qISv4FUjE84&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qISv4FUjE84?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>Of course, there are other companies that will probably enter the space of AR/VR hardware. Snapchat has Spectacles for AR. Microsoft also has a product called HoloLens, although from a product perspective, it does not compare to Quest 2, and there are rumors that Apple is working on some kind of VR/AR headsets. But for the time being, Meta for me seems to have an edge on the market since the glasses are not weird-looking, heavy, or clumsy.</p><ol start="2"><li><p><strong>Engines</strong></p></li></ol><p>Another important part of the puzzle for the Metaverse is software engine companies that can power this 3D world experience. They are the basic software stack that a developer needs to know to build this 3D world, from buildings to games and other items. There are currently two dominant engine companies, and they power most Metaverse SPACE/LANDs. One is Unity, and the other is Unreal Engine from Epic Games. While Unity is a public company already Epic Games is not. Both these companies, with their engines, provide a very important asset for anyone trying to build the Metaverse.</p><ol start="3"><li><p> <strong>Protocols</strong></p></li></ol><p>Protocols are a very complicated topic. In essence, these are the so-called cryptocurrencies, although they might not be the real currencies of these worlds on which the Metaverse network could function to trade things. They are a layer that takes care of transactions &amp; contracting and make items and things transferable. For example, Ethereum is one of the key ones right now and the biggest. Ethereum allows developers to form so-called smart contracts. From an investor standpoint, you need to understand that to run a Metaverse economy, you need to run it on a protocol. Right now, the protocols that are, in my view showing the most potential are Ethereum and Solana (but there are many others). I think Ethereum will be the big one, given its high adoption rate already and a strong position in the early Metaverse users. It still has flaws like very high transaction prices (because of high network usage) and relatively slow transaction speeds compared to a network like Solana. Current Ethereum can handle roughly 15-45 transactions per second, Solana 50.000 transactions per second.</p><p>But even despite all these challenges Ethereum has, they are still the go-to place network on which the Metaverse assets and coins are built. There is an upcoming change in Ethereum that has been called upon for years. It is supposed to happen in the next year or two, and it should reduce transaction fees (also called gas) of the network and make it handle more transactions per second (approx. 100.000 transactions per second). The network update is also known as Ethereum 2.0. It will also affect the inflation/deflation aspect on Ethereum but more on this in another article. An interesting fact is that the payment card Visa network can handle 1700 transactions per second.</p><ol start="4"><li><p><strong>Service infrastructure providers</strong></p></li></ol><p>This is an extensive segment. It represents any service you may use in the metaverse. Right now, I think the most apparent and mature enough services are first the marketplaces for trading digital items. These are marketplaces on which users can buy and sell digital items, also called NFTs (non-fungible tokens). If you imagine one day you will want an avatar representing you in the Metaverse, you will go on a marketplace and buy it from a creator (designer). You may also want some virtual concert tickets, and again you will go on a marketplace to buy them from the artist performing at the concert. And the marketplaces take fees in the form of % from the value of the transactions. Right now, the NFT market leader is a company called Open Sea. Their monthly trading volume in August was $3.4B and in September $3B. They charge a 2.5% fee each time you sell an NFT. This means they earned $85M in revenue in August and $75M in September. They also have around 500k total wallets registered right now. But recently, the publicly-traded company Coinbase (also a crypto exchange) announced they would open their own NFT marketplace. They even opened a waiting list to subscribe if you are interested in using the new marketplace. So far, and it has been only a few weeks already, more than 2.5 million people have entered their email on the waiting list, showing interest in the service.</p><p>Another service I recognize as potentially vital is ENS (also called Ethereum Name Service). To explain it in an easy-to-understand format: they are an identity provider. With their service, you can register a name/domain representing you in the Metaverse as your readable identity. For example, if you are called Brad, you could register the identity brad.eth, which would serve as your identifier through all of the Metaverse. To understand it as simple as possible, they are similar to GoDaddy for website domain registration, but that is only one part of ENS business, so it is a much bigger concept than just domain name registrator.</p><p>ENS decided to do a token listing and airdropped 25% of the supply of tokens to their users. The owners of the ENS token get governance rights and future revenue from ENS&#8217;s business as it charges users to register these identities. Interestingly, you do not have to wait to see how many &#8220;products&#8221; they sold each quarter (like this is the case for waiting on earnings results from public companies). You can see it in real-time any time as it is seen on the blockchain and with it open to everyone. As of writing this article, the fully diluted market cap of ENS is at $7.4B.</p><ol start="5"><li><p><strong>Space/Lands</strong></p></li></ol><p>Another important segment in the Metaverse are the so-called Spaces or Land ecosystems. These are the so-called digital worlds. In this segment, one obvious thing that stands out to me is that Meta will probably want to launch its own land/space as this is one of the most critical parts of the Metaverse. And from the big tech companies, they will probably not be the only ones. There will be quite a lot of competition between these spaces, in my view, but that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that there will only be one space/land. Roblox, for example, already has their own space/land in their game. But the competition is now coming also from decentralized platforms like Sandbox and Decentraland, Axie Infinity.</p><p>Now with Roblox, the only way for you to get exposure to their ecosystem is to buy the stock. But for decentralized Lands like Sandbox &amp; Decentraland, you have two ways. One is purchasing direct land plots, and the other is through the &#8220;economy&#8221; token (currency). In Sandbox&#8217;s case, that is the token SAND, and in Decentraland&#8217;s case, that is MANA.</p><p>Now with the Land plots, the way to value it is pretty straightforward. There are a limited number of land plots available in the whole ecosystem, and people can buy and trade the plots. The more this digital world becomes &#8220;populated,&#8221; and the more stuff people will want to build in it, the more the land plots will be worth. You also have to figure out (as with traditional land plots) the importance of the location of the plots. While I don&#8217;t want to get into too much detail, the point is that having land plots next to bigger land plots from famous brands (like Binance or Adidas, etc.) should be more valuable as the visitors of the plots of these renowned brands who will have services or experiences hosted on the plots could potentially also visit your land plots. And of course, if you have more visitors on your plot, you can sell them more of your own products/services, or you can rent the land to someone at a higher price&#8212;nothing complicated here.</p><p>Now with valuing the so-called currencies/coins of these lands, the thing gets more tricky. &nbsp;The best way to picture these currencies is like they are taxes. The logic is very similar in almost all of them. The token holders have governance power regarding the ecosystem, but they also get % of all transaction fees happening on the platform with these coins. The funds gathered from these fees are then mainly used for rewarding creators to develop more products and features in the ecosystem, for Play to earn reward systems &amp; for staking. I won't explain it here for those who do not know what staking is; you can check it out on this <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-staking">link</a>.</p><p>An example of these use cases and the flow of the ecosystem for the metaverse Sandbox:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f5881e3-1642-4fc6-bacb-32bf42e2c803_602x310.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f5881e3-1642-4fc6-bacb-32bf42e2c803_602x310.png" width="602" height="310" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7f5881e3-1642-4fc6-bacb-32bf42e2c803_602x310.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:310,&quot;width&quot;:602,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:84032,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f5881e3-1642-4fc6-bacb-32bf42e2c803_602x310.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f5881e3-1642-4fc6-bacb-32bf42e2c803_602x310.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f5881e3-1642-4fc6-bacb-32bf42e2c803_602x310.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f5881e3-1642-4fc6-bacb-32bf42e2c803_602x310.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"></figcaption></figure></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76477e7e-b90d-454e-b9fe-03a813fcaa8a_602x378.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76477e7e-b90d-454e-b9fe-03a813fcaa8a_602x378.png" width="602" height="378" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/76477e7e-b90d-454e-b9fe-03a813fcaa8a_602x378.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:378,&quot;width&quot;:602,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:111583,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76477e7e-b90d-454e-b9fe-03a813fcaa8a_602x378.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76477e7e-b90d-454e-b9fe-03a813fcaa8a_602x378.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76477e7e-b90d-454e-b9fe-03a813fcaa8a_602x378.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76477e7e-b90d-454e-b9fe-03a813fcaa8a_602x378.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">source: Sandbox white paper</figcaption></figure></div><p>Now while these decentralized metaverses do have their differences, in essence, the concept is the same.

But another company that is interesting in this regard is a public company called Matterport. They provide software for the 3D modeling of real-world space. They first started with you having to purchase a special camera and take photos from different angles with that camera of the space to do a 3D model. Still, recently they rolled out a feature with which you can take a picture of a space with your smartphone (iOS or Android), which is enough for you to have a 3D model. Currently, this is mainly used in the real estate market as listing agents show 3D tours of properties. I see this software as being important in the Metaverse AR concept. If Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s vision is to make your space more augmented and make projections of it in the Metaverse, you will need to use software similar to what Matterport has got to get a 3D model of your apartment/house (space). And I think the ability to be able to get a 3D model of a space with your smartphone is the thing that can drive mainstream adoption.</p><div id="youtube2-WxPa5qUG6rY" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;WxPa5qUG6rY&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WxPa5qUG6rY?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><ol start="7"><li><p><strong>Digital items (NFTs)</strong></p></li></ol><p>A vital principle of the Metaverse is that users can also own assets and take them with them even to different lands. This is a very different concept from the so-called web2 in which we live right now, where big platform companies own most of the items/products. In the Metaverse and the web 3.0. concept the users own the items (also called NFTs) and can sell them to other users at any time. These NFTs can range from avatars (pictures of a monkey, human, etc.) to art items (such as digital paintings). Usually, the point of the NFT is that it is unique and, in that way, represents some value as being viewed as a collector item. I have been exploring the NFT market activity in the last six months, and my findings are the following.</p><p>Because I am not a trader on the stock market but have a long-term investment strategy, I am looking for a similar concept in the NFT space. The first thing is the avatar NFT projects. The problem with them is that every day there are hundreds of new projects that are listed. Because there is such a big supply of them, most of them will be worth close to zero in a few years (I guess the actual price could be the price you would pay a designer to draw that avatar picture for you). But I think the exception will be avatar NFTs projects that were the first movers &amp; have built a brand (mainly because of the first-mover advantage) and have a strong, influential community. If I look at these influential projects, you maybe have two reasons to hold it from an investment standpoint. The first one is that you think the price will rise because new people will want to enter and buy this avatar. The</p><p> second is because you can use the community as a networking opportunity (like a ticket to a prestigious club). And if you think about the value of the project could be valued from how valuable all the members of this club are. For example, one of the most iconic avatar projects is called the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC). The project has been one of the first movers in this space and has gained many celebrities buying the Apes and even changing their Twitter pictures to these Apes. Two very influential ones are Stephen Curry &amp; Jimmy Fallon. You could picture that what you are essentially buying is a &#8220;ticket&#8221; to a club where you might hang out &amp; meet Curry and Fallon. Now the price to own a BAYC is not cheap. Currently, it&#8217;s around $180k for the lowest prices ape. But the interesting thing is that the longer the price stays high, the more people buy at this high price point, the more wealthy and influential people enter this community/network and make it more prestigious and exclusive. In the end, not many people can afford to spend $180k on a picture &#128522;</p><p>So my view is that only the influential and prestigious NFT avatar projects will, in fact, &#8220;survive&#8221; and could bring investment value. When more people start adopting the Metaverse, if a project stays exclusive and high priced. Because of this, I also invested in BAYC, but I didn&#8217;t pay $180k to acquire an ape because I didn&#8217;t want to allocate that much money &amp; I got in at a better price through buying a fractionalized vault that holds BAYC. Not to get into too many details, imagine a fractionalized NFT vault as a &#8220;company&#8221; that owns one or more NFTs like BAYC, and then this company sells shares so that people can buy and own a part of this company. With that, you can own a fraction of a BAYC without having to put down the whole $180k. A known site for checking these fractionalized NFT vaults is <a href="https://fractional.art/">Fractional Art</a>. With the fractional ownership of the NFT projects, there are some negatives to think about vs. owning the NFT straight up on your own. One is that the owners than represent more than 50% of the fractionalized shares can vote to sell an NFT at a desired price, there is less liquidity normally (although that is not always the case), and you don&#8217;t get the ability to network, because you can&#8217;t really say that this avatar represents you as there are multiple owners.</p><p>But even with the negatives, I still think it&#8217;s better to own a fraction of an influential &amp; strong branded project than to buy into the thousands of new avatar NFT projects coming out every day that will, in my view, have very little value in the future. Now, if you are a trader and want to trade, that is a different story (but don&#8217;t forget for trading NFTs, the transaction fees together with the marketplace fees &amp; the project fees are a lot of time, even 20% or more).</p><p>Besides the avatar NFT project, you also have classical digital art pieces from famous artists. The valuation behind this is similar to valuing physical art. I don&#8217;t own any of the Digital art pieces yet as I don&#8217;t have enough knowledge of the artists and the field to make a good decision.</p><p>But in the grand concept of the Metaverse, you won&#8217;t own only an avatar or a digital art piece. You could also buy concert tickets, digital shoes/clothes, items as NFTs, and use them in the Metaverse. You can already see the first push to start offering these pieces from famous shoe brands.

There is going to be a significant demand to draw and model a lot of items, buildings, and other stuff. And for designers, there are two essential software&#8217;s that they use. One is Adobe, and the other is Autodesk. These are the dominant software&#8217;s to have if you want to draw a static image or a 3D model. Owning stocks of these two companies could also provide you with exposure to the Metaverse economy.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>The Metaverse is not just a concept or a sci-fi movie, but it&#8217;s increasingly becoming a reality, and the first steps are already being made. As this space is evolving fast, more and more companies and assets will form the Metaverse, and when new interesting companies develop, I will make an updated version of this article to add those pieces. But for now, the assets mentioned in this article are the ones I am looking at most closely. I didn&#8217;t buy all mentioned companies and assets because I like to pick my stocks in specific sectors, so I also want to pick the &nbsp;&#8220;winners&#8221; in this space. From all the mentioned companies and assets, I do own Meta, Coinbase, Matterport, Ethereum, Sand, ENS &amp; fractionalized BAYC NFT. It&#8217;s just a matter of time before I include Unity and NVDA/AMD in my portfolio.</p><p>I hope this article was informative for many of you looking into this space, and if you liked it, I would be super happy if you shared it.

I will break down my investment thesis on why they are one of my portfolio companies and what I like or dislike about the company.</p><p>First of all, I don&#8217;t think I need to lose your time in presenting the basics of the company as most people know what Airbnb is. Airbnb has become a verb for finding a place to stay for vacation or even for working remotely lately. In fact, Airbnb stated on their S-1 form that approx. 91% of all traffic to Airbnb is either coming direct or through unpaid channels during the first nine months last year. That is a great data point that shows how well Airbnb has positioned its brand and how well people know it. For comparison, Airbnb&#8217;s competitor Booking Holding was reported to spend $1 billion in one quarter in 2018 just for Google ads. It is estimated that Booking was at least before the pandemic one of Google&#8217;s most prominent clients.</p><p>So let&#8217;s dive into Airbnb and why it is such a unique company for the travel, experience, and rental market.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b5035d6-ea95-45ff-b9e6-e11c62f568a3_1920x1087.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b5035d6-ea95-45ff-b9e6-e11c62f568a3_1920x1087.jpeg" width="1456" height="824" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3b5035d6-ea95-45ff-b9e6-e11c62f568a3_1920x1087.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:824,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:554036,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b5035d6-ea95-45ff-b9e6-e11c62f568a3_1920x1087.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b5035d6-ea95-45ff-b9e6-e11c62f568a3_1920x1087.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b5035d6-ea95-45ff-b9e6-e11c62f568a3_1920x1087.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b5035d6-ea95-45ff-b9e6-e11c62f568a3_1920x1087.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><strong>Total Addressable market</strong></p><p>First of all, we have to talk about its TAM. It is one of the biggest TAM&#8217;s out there. While TAM of itself doesn&#8217;t mean anything when you combine it with an innovative disruptor that executes and captures the market, your chances of getting a company that can grow big are high. Airbnb&#8217;s primary addressable market started with travel and people renting vacation properties. During the pandemic, we saw that Airbnb expanded its TAM to include the segment &#8220;living&#8221;. With "living," I mean renting out properties for a longer time &#8211; 28 days and longer, not to be on vacation but for living in it. The pandemic accelerated the remote work from anywhere trend, and all things indicate that a lot of it will also stay after the pandemic. Airbnb was the clear favorite for people looking to live in this way.</p><p>The third pillar to Airbnb&#8217;s amazing TAM is "Experience". The market for experiences represents what a person traveling might want to book besides the actual sleeping space (spa visits, sight-seeing trips, boat rides, etc.). While the Experience was an important segment for Airbnb before the pandemic, they put that segment on hold as people weren&#8217;t looking for much experience during the pandemic. But now we can see they are putting it back on the map, and it will be an essential driver of growth in the coming years.</p><p>And the fourth exciting element to their TAM is serving the Hotel industry as a service provider. First of all, Airbnb was a dominant player in the market of people renting out to people in the early days, but as it evolves with their extensive user base and reach, hotels can&#8217;t look the other way and ignore their enormous audience. Now we have to acknowledge that 90% of hosts on Airbnb are still individuals and that Airbnb is always going to stay a dominant platform for individual hosts. Still, the potential to grow and add clients like hotels when demand for specific locations is high and can&#8217;t be filled by individual hosts adds value to their customers and increases the TAM of Airbnb.</p><p>&nbsp;A few weeks ago, it was reported that Airbnb is testing out a new API-powered display that gives channel managers and distribution platforms the ability to load multiple rates plans for Airbnb properties. This creates flexibility for both travelers and hosts and potentially makes the platform more attractive to traditional hotels. This move is a big step and again competes with the offerings of its main rival Booking for helping and being also a service provider to Hotel and Hotel chains. When it comes to Hotels, it is 100% clear that even the big hotel chains do not have the brand power to attract such a large userbase of travelers as Airbnb can. And it only makes sense for hotels and hotel chains to partner with them and leverage their platform similar to what they did with Booking.</p><p>So as also stated in the S-1 filing of Airbnb, this is their estimation of the size of their TAM:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;We estimate our TAM to be $3.4 trillion, including $1.8 trillion for short-term stays, $210&nbsp;billion for long-term stays, and $1.4 trillion for experiences. For short-term stays, we assume an increase in trips per capita in line with expected travel market growth. For long-term stays, we calculate that we can address our estimate for the entire $48&nbsp;billion global serviced apartment market and 10% of the $1.6 trillion global residential rental market, or $162&nbsp;billion.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>So yeah, the number $3.4 trillion is a baffling number to digest, and I always take these estimates with a big grain of salt, but still, nobody can deny that they are addressing one of the biggest markets out there.</p><p>&nbsp;What get&#8217;s me even more excited than the TAM we just described is my view that they are not done yet. And with that, I mean the platform itself can offer so many other things to their loyal userbase. For example, I think Airbnb has a great opportunity in the coming years to become more social. That means to include more things where people can see what their friends visited, rated, how their trips, experiences looked like and at the end be a place where people can travel together and share their journeys. More on that in the Social potential of the Airbnb segment.</p><p><strong>Airbnb is also in China</strong></p><p>While most Western tech giants are banned from China, Airbnb operates in it(there). It started to operate in China about six years ago. At first, it faced big problems, and the adoption wasn&#8217;t quick as the market in China wasn&#8217;t ready for peer-to-peer hosting. Another problem soon emerged, and that was the competition. Many local Chinese companies adopted the Airbnb model and started offering the service. The market is now dispersed between companies like Tujia, Airbnb, Meituan Minsu, and Xiaozhu. With the market leader being Tujia. In early 2019 it was estimated that Airbnb had only 5-7% of the market. At that time, Tujia had 1.2M listing in China while Airbnb, at the same time, Airbnb had only 150k listings. But in late 2019, Airbnb&#8217;s efforts (mainly driven by the &#8220;localization&#8221; of the app) were starting to gain traction as it was rumored to have increased its market share by quite a lot. Localization efforts include introducing a Chinese name Ai-bi-ying, customer support in Chinese, partnership with Alipay, etc. Then the pandemic hit and put a hold on all things. But from the first data, it seems that Airbnb has solidified its brand in China and has retained a good brand reputation during the pandemic.</p><p>A strong presence in China is vital for Airbnb. &nbsp;Not only because of the direct revenue they can generate from that country, but also for the brand. Chinese consumers who travel the world familiarize with the brand, making them more likely to book accommodation on Airbnb when they travel abroad. The number of Chinese people traveling outside of China had been showing continuous growth until COVID-19: 107 million in 2014, 117 million in 2015, 122 million in 2016, and 310 million in 2019 (China Tourism Academy, 2017; 2020).</p><p><strong>The pandemic changed the whole company</strong></p><p>The pandemic was the most significant black swan event to hit the company. As the CEO Brian Chesky mentions in multiple interviews, it was one of the most challenging periods for any company that would face it as Airbnb did. Bookings dropped overnight by more than 80%; it was a total shocker. But what Airbnb got in that moment was a complete reset and refocusing moment for the whole company, and they took the opportunity with both hands and put it to their advantage. Looking back at the company's actions, they speak of the volume of how good Chesky handled the situation.</p><p>- Airbnb laid off 25% of their workforce</p><p>- They raised $1B in a new round in April 2020</p><p>- They reorganized their complete company structure</p><p>- They refocused on their key company offering, and they executed</p><p>While the layoff and gathering of capital might be something, many of the CEOs would think of a big important thing was the reorganization of the company structure and the refocusing. Chesky decided to reorganize the company from a division-led corporate structure to a more functional structure. It gave even more decision power &amp; responsibility to Chesky and made it so that the best talents in the whole company were focused on solving one problem. With this change, the organization became more lean &amp; effective. They now have one roadmap, aligned priorities for all the employees, decision time is shorter. The results of these changes in the last 12-18 months speak for themselves. Airbnb guided through the pandemic, launched more than 150 upgrades, &nbsp;delivered their first $1B EBITDA quarter, and went public via an IPO. This quote from Brian on the earnings call stuck out to me:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;I mean, we learned some very valuable lessons last year about focus. I remember once I was in college and my teachers told me, Brian, you can do everything you want in your life just not all at the same time. Yes, we certainly learned that less than last year. We had to scale back initiatives. But one of the benefits of all that, we took our very best people and we focused them only on a few problems, including recruiting more hosts, simplifying the guest journey, improving a world-class service and educating the world about Airbnb.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>We are already seeing and will see even more in the next two years that the pandemic made Airbnb stronger and increased its position in the market.&nbsp; To give you some signs that I am seeing that confirm this thesis:</p><ul><li><p>As Chesky said himself, the organization is more creative, the decision cycle is shorter, and products &amp; upgrades are shipping faster.</p></li><li><p>The company became much more profitable. The EBITDA margin in the last Q3 2021 was 50%, and not long ago, it was 30%.</p></li><li><p>In a recent interview for The Verge, Chesky mentioned that they are seeing fewer of their hosts cross-listing on other platforms than before the pandemic. This means people are using Airbnb more exclusively, and the competitors are losing share.</p></li><li><p>The pandemic opened up a new segment for Airbnb in long-term stay driven by the work from anywhere trend (stays longer than 28 days), as they now represent more than 20% of all the bookings on their platform (in Q3 2021). In my view, long-term stays are better than short-term, as people tend to be more connected to the local community if they stay longer, which brings an excellent opportunity for Airbnb to start offering Experiences and add additional revenue.</p></li><li><p>Cities start to welcome and call Airbnb to help them return tourism to their location. BIG SHIFT.</p></li><li><p>People in the pandemic started to travel and explore places they didn&#8217;t visit before ( more rural areas that weren&#8217;t frequently visited before). This means more supply for Airbnb as people do not travel to only the top tourist-attacked cities in the world. Hence more revenue for the coming years also from travel.</p></li></ul><p>All the above signs show that Airbnb is the company that will benefit significantly in the years ahead because of the pandemic and the shift that happened in travel and living.</p><p><strong>Cities have turned the table. Airbnb is welcome!</strong></p><p>For years Airbnb had problems with regulators and cities trying to push them out. Individual hosts renting properties for tourists meant fewer properties available for locals for long-term rentals, which drove real-estate prices, especially in the densely populated and tourist-attracted areas, to increase dramatically. The hotels were also not happy with the new competition and pushed local legislators to help them out.</p><p>But guess what. The pandemic changed the table completely!</p><p>Because of the pandemic, many cities that lived off of tourism had a hard time. Cross-board travel was shut down, or limited people weren&#8217;t traveling that much, and the towns saw how dependant they are on travel and the income they get from tourists. They had the problem of under tourism.</p><p>&nbsp;And now, instead of looking at Airbnb as their enemy, they turned to them to help them reach more people and bring back the tourists. In the interview with Verge, Brian explained that many local cities reached out to them for help. The residents of these cities were afraid of their financial situation as they were dependent on the tourists. Many studies also found out that cities with Anti-Airbnb laws saw less housing development and lower property values, which again affects the owners of these properties that pay taxes.</p><p>So I think this shift in looking at Airbnb as your friend instead of your enemy will bring many benefits and will make Airbnb&#8217;s path with regulators and legislators much easier from now on.</p><p>And yes, as the pandemic unfolds and the world gets back to a normal state, we might again see similar attempts like in the past to try to limit Airbnb. Still, I think the experience learned in this pandemic will make many local legislators pause and think twice before pushing an important economic society empowerer such as Airbnb out of their state.</p><p><strong>The social potential Airbnb has, and nobody is talking about</strong></p><p>I know most people view Airbnb as a travel platform, but I have something else in mind. Another ample opportunity that Airbnb has is that it becomes more of a social platform, and I think you are already seeing some first signs of that. Airbnb rolled out a feature where hosts can talk to other hosts and share their experiences. The main reason for this is that new hosts can hear and learn about how it is like renting property on Airbnb, address their concerns, and get some helpful tips before starting this journey.</p><p>While this is a tiny step in the social segment, I think Airbnb will go deeper down this path and make the platform more social. I am thinking of features like travelers being able to follow other travelers and see where they went in an interactive way filled with their photos/videos of their trips and, of course, reviews of the places they stayed. I even see an &#8220;Airbnb travel influencer&#8221; category, where people will follow exciting travelers. The travelers will have their Airbnb profile full of their travel experience and their whole life-travel journey in one place. On the other hand, hosts will want to participate in this social experience and sway these influencers to stay at their properties. It could mean more bookings and higher prices for the properties an influencer will recommend. But this is just a glimpse of what I see down the road. As experiences develop and Airbnb gets into this segment, the social aspect will follow soon as it complements each other perfectly.</p><p><strong>Valuation</strong></p><p>Now let&#8217;s move to the hard part&#8212;the valuation.</p><p>To get a sense of the valuation, I will compare the company to its two main competitors Booking Holdings and Expedia.</p><p>At first glance, here at the number of these companies. The most straightforward metric to compare them at first is the Price To Sales ratio on a Trailing Twelve-month (TTM):</p><p>Expedia &#8211; 3.75</p><p>Booking &#8211; 10.5</p><p>Airbnb &#8211; 23.7</p><p>If we look at these companies from a potential profitability aspect, we see the first problems. Recently Airbnb reported their quarter where they managed to make a $1B in EBITDA. That is an EBITDA margin of 50%. Looking at Bookings numbers, they are also in the 50% EBITDA margin camp. But Expedia is not there. Their EBITDA margin is way lower as they spend more on marketing and sales (it is more in the 10% camp). Even if they cut their R&amp;D spending to zero, they would still be in the 25% range. This shows in my view that the platform's brand effect is not so strong as the other two competitors. I will exclude Expedia as I think Booking is a far better comparison.</p><p>What is essential for this valuation analysis is where these companies are in terms of revenue (on a TTM basis) compared to the &#8220;normal&#8221; year of 2019.</p><p>Booking has reached 61% of revenue from the year 2019</p><p>Expedia has reached 60% of revenue from the year 2019</p><p>Airbnb has reached 110% of revenue from the year 2019</p><p>We can see that Airbnb is a broader platform with its living segment and is less dependent on cross-border travel than the other two. It seems they even added to their market share in 2020.</p><p>The drops in revenue in the year 2020 &nbsp;because of the pandemic also show ABNB as a more resilient business:</p><p>Expedia revenue drop 2020 vs 2019 = 56.6%</p><p>Booking revenue drop 2020 vs 2019 = 54.6%</p><p>Airbnb revenue drop 2020 vs 2019 = 29.2%</p><p>Before we saw that Booking is the competitor, we need to compare it given the similar profitability levels. The next phase is for us to look at the growth rate. And to be entirely objective, let&#8217;s look at the growth rate of these companies before the pandemic to see how the market share was moving in &#8220;normal conditions&#8221;.</p><p>Airbnb in the last two years before the pandemic saw revenue growth in the range of 30-44%</p><p>Booking in the previous two years before the pandemic saw revenue growth in the range of 3.4-15%</p><p>Airbnb was growing around three times faster than Booking. We can estimate that given the similar profitability but better growth, business resilience, and bigger TAM (Airbnb also has the living segment), Airbnb deserves a 3-2x higher multiple than Booking. Currently, the market is pricing precisely that as Booking P/S is at 10.5 and ABNB is at 23.7</p><p>Now let&#8217;s look at my Airbnb revenue estimates for next year. My main hypothesis is that cross-border travel will return to 2019 levels and that the average price per night will be higher given all the inflation we are seeing. For a good glimpse of where the total current travel market is at, I am taking the 60% mark. The 60% mark is based on the current revenue being 60% of the 2019 revenue with Booking and Expedia because they are more dependent on cross-border travel and travel in general. With this estimation, the travel segment should grow 66% in 2022 vs. 2021 to reach 2019.</p><p>Now given that 20-25% of Airbnb bookings in 2021 were long-term stays, I will estimate that out of the $5.3B (TTM) in revenue in 2021- &nbsp;22% (the mid-point) or $1.16B is the Living segment, and the rest ($4.14B) is the travel segment. This is just an estimation as Airbnb doesn&#8217;t give a breakdown of the numbers by segments.</p><p>Given my expectation of a 66% increase in travel bookings in 2022, I expect to see that $4.15B increase to $6.9B for the travel segment. For the valuation measurement, I will estimate that the other segment, the &#8220;living&#8221; segment, will stay flat at $1.16B.</p><p>Airbnb also noted on their last earnings call is that the average price per night was 30% higher than in 2019 because of two reasons. The first one is because of the mix of people booking more expensive and bigger properties and the second one because of an increase in prices (probably because of inflation). Now again, we don&#8217;t know how much each factor contributed to the overall 30% increase. I &nbsp;will estimate that the prices in 2022 will be 15% higher than in 2019, given the inflationary environment and that the booking mix between smaller and bigger properties will return to &#8220;normal&#8221; (similar to that of 2019).</p><p>If we calculate based on these estimations we get Airbnb&#8217;s revenue estimation for 2022 - ($6.9B + $1.16B) * 15% increase in prices = $9.27B in total revenue.</p><p>I also view Airbnb as a platform/software company as I believe that they will be able to maintain revenue growth of 30% or more in the coming years. They also showed us they could have a 50% EBITDA margin, and their TAM is not even near its full potential. So I think they should have similar valuation multiples as platform companies.</p><p>Given all the stated and the 10x Sales ratio of their competitor Booking with a much lower growth history, my internal multiple for ABNB given next year is 20x Sales, which would, given the revenue estimation, give it a $185B market cap or $291 per share.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>Airbnb is one of those companies with all the qualities needed to have an important allocation in my portfolio. It is a scalable platform with an enormous TAM. It has a strong market position, cult brand, outstanding leadership with Brian at the helm, and keeps innovating new features and products every year. They are, in my view, still the disruptor of the industry and not the disrupted. I also think 2022 will be a great year for Airbnb as travel picks up and as people will want to go and visit places they couldn&#8217;t for the last two years because of the pandemic. I think there is actual pent-up demand for travel. We can see the first signs already from what management said&nbsp; on the last earnings call:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;And just to give you one anecdote or one data point on October 15, I believe it was that date that President Biden announced the reopening of the borders for international travelers come to the United States. Within one week of that announcement, we saw a 44% spike in nights booked for stays, crossing borders coming into United States on Airbnb for stays November 9 and later, which is when the borders would open.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Airbnb also benefits from a trend that is here to stay, and that is work from anywhere. And in this category, Airbnb is the obvious choice. As management mentioned on the earnings call:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;We highlighted on the shareholder letter that 45% of our nights were from stays at least seven nights. You&#8217;re not going to want to stay in a hotel room for 28 nights, but those trends are continuing&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Not to mention the most significant asset they have &#8211; their brand. More than 90% of searches are unpaid organic because Airbnb is a verb. With this fact and the fact that their marketing is getting more effective and represents a less and less % of total revenue, I think we will soon see how profitable this platform can be.</p><p><strong>I also have some GREAT PERSONAL NEWS</strong>. <strong>I am starting a new SHOW on a social podcasting platform called Callin.</strong> &nbsp;The show is called UncoverAlpha (yes, the same as this newsletter &#128522;).

Many of them are even selecting them as their exclusive partner.</p><p>This institutional adoption is one of the key signals I want to point out as I believe this adoption will continue to increase. Coinbase has some advantages compared to competitors that make it more appealing for institutional clients.</p><p>Coinbase is perceived through its actions, licenses, public company, and brand as the most legal/compliant platform player in the crypto space. You still have to understand that crypto is still perceived as a possible gray area for many institutional investors because of its lack of regulation and, in some cases, rightfully so. But Coinbase has positioned itself as the one who welcomes regulation.</p><p>The other reason is the product offering. Coinbase is basically an integrated Prime broker with custodian and other services in one platform. And because crypto is such a volatile environment with big gains and big losses, the clients find it more valuable from a platform to have everything you need in one place from an operational perspective than having multiple solutions scatter around the place.</p><p>When it comes to fees, Coinbase&#8217;s basic offering is not among the cheapest, but its institutional offering, called Coinbase PRO, has competitive fees if you have assets over $100M.</p><p><strong>Profitable retail base</strong></p><p>Institutional revenue is good for building long-term stability in your business, but the retail base is where the profit is right now.</p><p>Out of $452B in trading volume in Q2 2021, retail clients represented 31.4% of that. But at the same time, out of $1.93B revenue from transactions, retail represented 94.7% of it. So retail is where Coinbase makes most of its money so far. Looking at the income statement for the last quarter, the business is wildly profitable.</p><p>Total revenue for the last quarter was $2.2B, up 1097% YoY and Operating income was $0.87B up 1980% YoY (yes, these numbers are not a typo). If we look at the last six months, the picture is similar&#8212;$ 1.86B in operating income on $4B in revenue. So, the business is generating serious profits.</p><p>While transaction revenue is mainly driven by volatility in the crypto space, subscription and other service revenue gets me excited.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1b03f32-2583-48a9-af73-e6cbc6810683_602x396.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1b03f32-2583-48a9-af73-e6cbc6810683_602x396.png" width="602" height="396" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e1b03f32-2583-48a9-af73-e6cbc6810683_602x396.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:396,&quot;width&quot;:602,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:90653,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1b03f32-2583-48a9-af73-e6cbc6810683_602x396.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1b03f32-2583-48a9-af73-e6cbc6810683_602x396.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1b03f32-2583-48a9-af73-e6cbc6810683_602x396.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1b03f32-2583-48a9-af73-e6cbc6810683_602x396.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">source: Coinbase Q2 2021 earnings presentation</figcaption></figure></div><p>It has grown from almost zero revenue a year ago to $102M revenue in the last quarter. To put that in perspective, if the revenue from this segment stayed the same for all four quarters, it would be the same as Cloudflare's 2020 yearly revenue.</p><p>From the earnings call, we could hear that one of these services is staking. And this service almost didn't even exist one year ago.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220; The first one, is that we're continuing to see this trend of people using crypto for more and more things beyond trading. So for example, we shared in the letter that we now have 1.7 million users doing staking in crypto, which is a way to earn yield on your assets. And this is up from -- basically, that number was probably zero a year ago. I think if you go back to 2019, late 2019, we had less than 1 million MTUs on our retail side for Coinbase in total. And now we have 1.7 million just doing one type of activity that is staking. So we're seeing people do more and more things with crypto, whether that's earning money with 1 crypto, borrowing and lending, staking, using Coinbase card and then, of course, trading. And so I think we'll continue to see that percentage go up over time, which is great. That tells us that a truly a cryptoeconomy is forming, it's not just the trading platform.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>And this segment, especially the blockchain revenue, is expected to grow as customers use more products besides trading.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Blockchain rewards were $39 million in Q2. Blockchain rewards are generated through our interactions with various blockchain protocols where the underlying blockchain is providing rewards to the user. Historically, these revenues were generated exclusively through Staking. However, we are now including inflationary rewards, or community rewards, into Blockchain rewards which were previously included in Other subscription and services revenues.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>This segment will be a significant contributor in the following years as I expect the % of total revenue to lean more and more towards this segment away from the trading segment. With crypto being such a fast-developing environment, new services will constantly be needed.</p><p><strong>Market share</strong></p><p>Coinbase reported in their Q2 2021 earnings that they had 8.8 million retail Monthly Transacting Users (MTUs), up 44% from Q1 2021, and that total verified users were 68 million. Again interesting perspective Cash App from Square has around 70 million active users, and PayPal's Venmo is reported to have 75 million. Coinbase also reported 9.000 institutions that are using them.</p><p>Their main competitors are crypto exchanges such as Binance, Gemini, OKex &amp; many others, but also fintech players like Robinhood.</p><p>Since most crypto exchanges such as Gemini, Binance, and Gemini are not public companies, it is tough to find credible data on the number of their userbase. Since estimates are all over the place and with no credible source, I won't provide them.</p><p>But we can look at the total trading volume from the exchanges and see how much of the volume is done through which. I calculated the monthly trading volume of three exchanges, Coinbase, Binance, and Gemini, for the last 30 days and the results are the following:</p><p>Binance- $25.5B</p><p>Coinbase &#8211; $4.85B</p><p>Gemini &#8211; $0.225B</p><p>We can see that Binance, in terms of trading volume, is the clear leader, followed by Coinbase. But what differentiates Binance and Coinbase the most is that Binance is perceived as a less compliant or, should I say, regulated exchange than Coinbase. My hunch is that users who want to stay more anonymous for different reasons rather use Binance than Coinbase. Binance is also a cheaper alternative when it comes to fees, and because of the anonymity factor and lower fees, it attracts users with higher assets that generate more volume.</p><p>But being a more regulated and compliant crypto exchange will be a big competitive advantage down the line, as many institutions and corporations want to enter the market.&nbsp; They want to choose a compliant and regulated partner in their jurisdiction, and given the history, I think Binance will have a lot of trouble on this front, which gives Coinbase the upper hand.</p><p><strong>Regulation</strong></p><p>As already mentioned, Coinbase is the exchange that is most compliant in the crypto space. They are also the only public crypto exchange company so far. They are proactive with regulators, and they even welcome them. A few days ago, Coinbase said the US should create a new cryptocurrency regulator and laid out a policy paper with suggestions. They know that the more the market is regulated, the bigger their competitive advantage is. Being active with regulators is also good for the long-term stability of the business, as this is a concern for many investors looking at the crypto space.</p><p>But not just US regulation they are expanding international but want to comply with the new rules and laws in each country, as we can see from these remarks in the last earnings call:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;In Germany, our subsidiary Coinbase Germany GmbH was awarded a license for crypto custody and trading from the German Federal Financial Authority (BaFin). The BaFin licensing framework is the first of its kind in the European Union, and Coinbase Germany is the first company to be issued such a license.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;In Japan, we have successfully registered with the local regulator JFSA (Financial Services Agency of Japan) as a crypto asset exchange service provider. This registration will enable us to actively solicit customers in Japan and provide them a range of crypto services. We see huge long-term potential in Japan, the third largest economy in the world, with an active and mature crypto customer base.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>In my view, cryptocurrency exchanges are entering a new era where regulation will play an important role, and many exchanges will fail because of it. Coinbase is in the right driver seat when it comes to these exchanges and the regulation.</p><p><strong>Investment thesis</strong></p><p>Now above, we discussed their core business, and from the core business, two things stood out to me. Institutional adoption will be growing in the future, and the subscription and other service segments will speed up and help the transaction revenue as more and more features are added to the platform and investors start using them.</p><p>But here are the topics that got me really excited and made me pull the trigger and add Coinbase to my portfolio:</p><p>- Coinbase building an App store</p><p>- AWS of Crypto</p><p>- NFT marketplace</p><p>- Facebook digital wallet Novi custodian deal</p><p>- Valuation</p><ol><li><p> <strong>Coinbase building an App store</strong></p></li></ol><p>Coinbase mentioned on their last earnings call that they want to be focused on providing as much third-party integration as possible. This makes perfect sense as the crypto space is a fast-paced and rapidly changing environment where new things pop up every year, and if you want to keep your userbase loyal and happy, you have to give them access to these things and the convenience of being a one-stop-shop. And after digging deeper, you can see they intend to build an Apple-like App store:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;And so, we're doing that with a kind of crypto app store, if you will, that can be built right into the app&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>This is key, as it increases the chance that Coinbase base stays relevant and always &#8220;up to date&#8221; even in a fast-evolving landscape like crypto is. Having an app store where developers can contribute their apps that are integrated with Coinbase and offer those services to the massive user base is a win-win for both the third-party developer and Coinbase as their users won&#8217;t be looking for other platforms that can fulfill their changing needs. This is also important in future light when you can expect more and more companies, especially from the traditional financial service industry, to enter this space and try to compete. But having a robust developer ecosystem can be essential.</p><ol start="2"><li><p><strong>AWS of Crypto</strong></p></li></ol><p>When we talk about the risks and competitive pressures, we often come to the fact that at some point down the line, traditional financial service companies will want to enter the space and compete with Coinbase and other crypto platforms. While this is a risk to consider, what is also expected is that most non-tech-based companies in the financial space have trouble building the technology infrastructure to compete. And this is where Coinbase is making another smart move. Instead of being hostile to the traditional financial service competition, it welcomes it and even offers its services to them.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;We want every single financial services company out there to enter the crypto space because we believe this is going to be a huge part of the economy in the future, a substantial portion of global GDP. And so we want every bank and financial service company and fintech out there to integrate crypto, if they haven't started already, and many of them have. So I think this is partially a competition for us, but it's also partially an opportunity because one of the things we're building is called Coinbase Cloud, and this is kind of our AWS for crypto product. It's taking all those difficult things that we've had to build that I mentioned, integrating with blockchains and transaction monitoring and custody and everything and exposing those through APIs in a way that any third party can actually build on top of those services, those APIs to get to market faster. And we're seeing interest from a number of those financial service players, for instance. And so I think that we may have an opportunity to actually create a big business out of that as more and more people enter the space and not have it just be purely competitive&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>A very similar phenomenon can be seen in the Fin-tech space, where traditional banks partner with Fin-tech companies to help them with the technology infrastructure aspect. This move by Coinbase is genius in my view and adds another possible revenue stream down the road that could become very significant.</p><ol start="3"><li><p><strong>NFT marketplace</strong></p></li></ol><p>Coinbase announced that it would launch an NFT peer-to-peer marketplace this year. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is another rapidly growing field in the crypto space that has been growing lately. I won&#8217;t go into details about what NFTs are, as this is not the point of this article. The fact is that there is a market for NFTs right now, and this market is growing. Similar to cryptocurrencies, people are buying and selling NFTs, and the volumes are not small. For a better understanding, currently, the market-leading NFT exchange is OpenSea. Their monthly trading volume in August was $3.4B and in September $3B. They charge a 2.5% fee each time you sell an NFT. This means they earned $85M in revenue in August and $75M in September. They also have around 500k total wallets registered right now. </p><p>Coinbase opened a waiting list for their NFT marketplace, where people can sign up if they are interested. In 6 days after the waitlist was announced, more than 2.3 million accounts had already signed up.</p><p>So the NFT marketplace news is a big deal because it expands its product offering and will add significant new revenue in the coming months and years.</p><ol start="4"><li><p><strong>Facebook digital wallet Novi custodian deal</strong></p></li></ol><p>A few days ago, Coinbase announced that Facebook had chosen Coinbase to handle custody services for their pilot digital wallet Novi. Novi is a digital wallet that will enable people to send and receive money instantly and with no fees.</p><p>This news is the biggest of them all for Coinbase. Facebook&#8217;s plan for a digital wallet that will enable people to transfer money is one of the most important future projects for Coinbase. Given Facebook&#8217;s plans to offer this down the line to their more than 2 billion user base, this means a lot of assets for Coinbase to have in custody and a lot of new fees with it. Suppose Facebook launches this product and offers it in its flagship products like Instagram, Messenger, Whatsapp. In that case, it could become the leading way for people to conduct P2P transactions and C2B transactions, as many businesses already use Whatsapp and Facebook Shops to operate and communicate with their clients. The most significant risk for this project is legislation and the senate, as regulators already fear Facebook.</p><p><strong>Valuation</strong></p><p>Now let's look at the valuation. Because it is complicated to value some new business opportunities, I will leave some out to make the valuation more conservative. I will leave out the value of the FB custodian deal, AWS for the crypto initiative, and App Store because, at this point, the value of all these initiatives would be pure guessing. In the valuation, I will only include Coinbase&#8217;s current business: the crypto trading platform together with other services and the NFT marketplace.</p><p>Given the nature of the crypto industry, the figures can be very volatile and hard to predict but let&#8217;s start with the things that management guided for this year.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Q3 2021 In July, retail MTUs and total Trading Volume were 6.3 million and $57.0 billion, respectively, as crypto asset prices and crypto asset volatility declined significantly relative to Q2 levels. August month-to-date, retail MTUs, and Trading Volume levels have slightly improved compared to July levels but remain lower than earlier in the year. As a result, we believe retail MTUs and total Trading Volume will be lower in Q3 as compared to Q2.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>With that trading volume in mind, here are the calculations:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5da57d9b-7bee-4320-86e2-4bddeeb13544_602x85.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5da57d9b-7bee-4320-86e2-4bddeeb13544_602x85.png" width="602" height="85" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5da57d9b-7bee-4320-86e2-4bddeeb13544_602x85.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:85,&quot;width&quot;:602,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:24090,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5da57d9b-7bee-4320-86e2-4bddeeb13544_602x85.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5da57d9b-7bee-4320-86e2-4bddeeb13544_602x85.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5da57d9b-7bee-4320-86e2-4bddeeb13544_602x85.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5da57d9b-7bee-4320-86e2-4bddeeb13544_602x85.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">source: company data and own calculations</figcaption></figure></div><p>For Q3 and Q4, I took managements Q3 July trading volume and extrapolated them till the end of the year, even though they said that August was higher in terms of trading volume than July (so again, taking the conservative side).</p><p>If we take these numbers, we get to the full year 2021 revenue number of $5.13B.</p><p>Now let&#8217;s look at the NFT marketplace potential quantified for next year for Coinbase.

The potential on the waiting list suggests Coinbase could rake in $4.4B a year from the NFT marketplace alone. Still, to be conservative since we do not know how many of those signed up white-list users are actually going to use it, I took a very conservative assumption that only 250k wallets will be using it and with it that the volume at the start will be half of what the market leader OpenSea is having. With that conservative assumption, we get to annual revenue from this segment for Coinbase at $480M.</p><p>The current market cap of Coinbase is $82.4B, so it is trading at an estimated forward P/S for this year of 16.</p><p>Before we get into estimations and my scenarios, we need to understand that Coinbase&#8217;s revenue is also very dependent on the price moves of cryptocurrencies and the volatility. In the past, the main driver was mostly Bitcoin prices. Now, since the distribution between Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum vs. other cryptocurrencies at Coinbase is 50/50, the prices of the whole crypto market matter. But in the past five years the price &amp; volatility of Bitcoin was the main determining factor so let&#8217;s see how Coinbase&#8217;s revenue moved and how Bitcoin prices moved in those years.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5302822f-3310-49d3-bb83-34aa37c734cc_575x120.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5302822f-3310-49d3-bb83-34aa37c734cc_575x120.png" width="575" height="120" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5302822f-3310-49d3-bb83-34aa37c734cc_575x120.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:120,&quot;width&quot;:575,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:4240,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5302822f-3310-49d3-bb83-34aa37c734cc_575x120.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5302822f-3310-49d3-bb83-34aa37c734cc_575x120.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5302822f-3310-49d3-bb83-34aa37c734cc_575x120.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5302822f-3310-49d3-bb83-34aa37c734cc_575x120.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">source: company data and own calculations</figcaption></figure></div><p>We can see that we can&#8217;t extrapolate the company's future revenue growth in a straight upward line, as Coinbase already had almost $1B in revenue in the year 2017 when Bitcoin prices went from $900 to $13k. Later, Bitcoin prices fell from $13k to $3.7k, and Coinbase revenue dropped almost 50% to $0.52B.</p><p>But what we can see from this past data is that even in a scenario where crypto prices would drop significantly, we can reasonably assume that Coinbase revenue will not drop more than 50%. We can also see another interesting pattern emerging from the past, and that is in the year 2019. Bitcoin price nearly doubled from $3.7k to $7k, but revenue stayed the same.</p><p>So for my Base scenario, I will assume that crypto prices in 2022 won&#8217;t move up more than 100% and down more than 20%. That is why I will model a modest 10% increase in revenue for their transaction and service revenue segment. For my negative scenario, I will take the case of a severe drop in crypto prices which results in an almost 50% loss of revenue compared to the previous year (based on the year 2018, where a severe drop in crypto prices didn&#8217;t result in a more than 50% revenue drop).</p><p>Again this is not a prediction, and only my base case scenario assumption as I think nobody can predict any price let alone prices of cryptocurrencies. I want to present both scenarios so that you can get a feeling of Coinbases valuation in each of these scenarios.</p><p>Here are the scenarios and estimates for the year 2022.</p><p>These projections have the following estimates:</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Base case:&nbsp; Revenue increase of 10% vs. the year 2021 of the current business (trading and services), revenue from NFT marketplace conservative estimation, EBITDA margin at 44% of Revenue (similar to what was reported Q2 2021).</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Negative case: Revenue decrease of the current business by 47% (extrapolation of expected July 2021 revenue on a yearly basis for the whole year 2022), revenue from NFT marketplace conservative estimation, EBITDA margin at 44% of Revenue.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07500082-bf60-467b-aa77-48d2848f1e41_389x138.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07500082-bf60-467b-aa77-48d2848f1e41_389x138.png" width="389" height="138" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/07500082-bf60-467b-aa77-48d2848f1e41_389x138.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:138,&quot;width&quot;:389,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:4490,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07500082-bf60-467b-aa77-48d2848f1e41_389x138.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07500082-bf60-467b-aa77-48d2848f1e41_389x138.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07500082-bf60-467b-aa77-48d2848f1e41_389x138.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07500082-bf60-467b-aa77-48d2848f1e41_389x138.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">source: company data and own calculations</figcaption></figure></div><p>With my base case estimation, we get to a forward P/S multiple of 13.5 and a forward EV/EBITDA of 30.5. In my negative scenario, we get to a 23.7 forward P/S and 54 EV/EBITDA.</p><p>Now in both of these cases, Coinbase doesn&#8217;t seem to overvalued to me. My fair value for the company in the stage where Coinbase is at a forward P/S of around 15-20 seems appropriate, given the high EBITDA margin. That is also considering new initiatives that they have going on that we mentioned in the article (FB custodian, AWS for crypto, App store&#8230;), and we didn&#8217;t include them in our calculations of the valuation.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>I think Coinbase is making all the right moves right now in the crypto space. It is positioning itself as the most regulated, compliant exchange and platform. This is a crucial moment as many, not just retail but also institutional investors, seek partners in the crypto space. They are also innovating and opening new sources of potential revenue, which will benefit them in the long run. I opened a position in the company a few days ago, before this big run-up in recent days, but I also added to my position right after the Facebook custody news was announced.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I own COIN in my portfolio.</p><p>Nothing contained in this website and newsletter should be understood as&nbsp;investment or financial advice.

But the earnings call shed some light on why these numbers were such a miss.</p><p>The main reason: The users that left were users that came during the lockdowns to Pinterest primarily through search and were on desktop. So, the latest engaged users of all.</p><p>Management note:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Well, most of the difference between what we guided and what we reported are people who came to Pinterest from the web versus from mobile apps. These users tended to be, on average, less engaged and generated less revenue than people who came directly to Pinterest.&#8221; </p></blockquote><p>In fact the most engaged users and the ones that bring most of the revenue the mobile users grew by more than 20% YoY in this quarter. Also, Gen-Z audience grew double digits YoY.</p><p>So what we can take from the MAU results is that Pinterest lost some of the users that came because of the pandemic, but these users were low quality, to begin with. The only thing I was sad not to see is that management would give this low-quality users data last year when it was affecting PINS in a positive way so that investors would not be shocked when we see these users unwind.</p><p>On the user side, I am concerned if I see users that are actually using a platform like Pinterest go away. This shows either that the product itself is not good enough to fulfill the need of the users or that the competition has a better alternative. But in this case, the users that left the Pinterest platform were users that weren&#8217;t really using the platform but just happen to stumble upon it while surfing through the internet. I will keep a close eye on this trend in the next quarters, but as long as the &#8220;real&#8221; users aren&#8217;t leaving the platform I am not that concerned.</p><p><strong>Revenue and monetization</strong></p><p>Now the bright spot of these earnings report were the monetization efforts. Revenue grew 125% which was higher than expected and ARPU was particularly good.</p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd508db3d-ab3f-4c7f-a7ad-b07638d36f91_903x511.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd508db3d-ab3f-4c7f-a7ad-b07638d36f91_903x511.png" width="903" height="511" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d508db3d-ab3f-4c7f-a7ad-b07638d36f91_903x511.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:511,&quot;width&quot;:903,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:137290,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd508db3d-ab3f-4c7f-a7ad-b07638d36f91_903x511.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd508db3d-ab3f-4c7f-a7ad-b07638d36f91_903x511.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd508db3d-ab3f-4c7f-a7ad-b07638d36f91_903x511.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd508db3d-ab3f-4c7f-a7ad-b07638d36f91_903x511.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">source: Pinterest Q2 earnings presentation</figcaption></figure></div><p>Global ARPU up 89% while international ARPU up 163% YoY.</p><p>These numbers show a higher than expected pace of monetization for Pinterest and at the same time show, Pinterest is really the platform where monetization is easy. I believe in my thesis that the more Pinterest is monetized or shall we say the more shoppable it is the more useful the platform will be and the more users will join it. It is one of the rare platforms where monetization is welcomed by the users.</p><p>Management also noted on the call that many new advertisers are joining the platform including big advertisers and that we can expect that the average ad price will rise because of more bidding for ad space etc.</p><p>Now honestly I had no doubt that Pinterest can monetize its a platform well and that advertisers, especially from specific sectors (retail, home d&#233;cor, etc.), will love it but it is still good to see actual results confirming this thesis.</p><p><strong>Pinterest evolving?</strong></p><p>Now the last important thing I want to address on the earnings call is a new shift in which management said PINS wants to go. That is into the creator economy and being a more engaging platform for user-to-user interactions. Now PINS was always a platform that lacked the user to user engagement in my view but, I didn&#8217;t see the need for them to have it as their primary use-case of being the go-to place to find stuff that you want to buy is good enough for me. But now with this shift to a more user-to-user engagement, I find this could provide some positive upside surprise. If they get this right and onboard creators and get the users to engage they have a great chance to evolve into a platform similar to Pinduoduo or WeChat in China. With the right partners to fill in the gaps like Payment etc., it could work out for them. I also think Pinterest could provide an interesting value proposition for creators as their content can be more evergreen (example. How to perfectly grill a steak?) &#8211; similar to YouTube and with that their content monetization value rises as opposed to short videos that disappear. As a creator, you don&#8217;t have to make new and new content constantly. </p><p>For me going in the direction of trying to make the platform more engaged for user-to-user interaction is a good attempt. If they make it - great it brings another level of value. If they don&#8217;t it is also not a big deal. The only thing we have to take into account is that this &#8220;test&#8221; will cost them something. They explained and guided for Q3 revenue in the mid-40s because of this shift to the creator focus platform as they will be giving up on some ad space for creators instead of advertisers. But still, I feel like with every platform going to video and user engagement it is a well-balanced risk/reward experiment for them.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>The user number is the one that totally affected and overshadowed the whole earnings results. One of the reasons in my view is also the fact that PINS is not a traditional social media company but more of a social commerce platform. The measurement of MAU and DAU is probably not so much important with PINS because even if you go to the platform one time, it is the time when you want to buy something specific and are looking for ideas on this item, so you are logged on the platform at the prime moment to get monetized. It&#8217;s like you logged on to your Amazon account when you already have an intention to buy something which makes the one-time you log in a lot more valuable than if you would logging in multiple times without any intention to buy but just to be there because you are bored. Let&#8217;s look at things realistically, if somebody is selling to you a $5k couch and you are surfing through TikTok, Instagram, or Snapchat doing your stuff an ad won&#8217;t be much effective. While if you log in to Pinterest and search for couches you are much likely to be monetized for this case. Quality overtrumps quantity. And that is why we are seeing increased interest from advertisers on the Pinterest platform.</p><p>The stock price dropped like a rock and fell more than 25% after the earnings. The market cap of the company is now $36B which is very low in my view. The company is trading at around 12-14 times this year&#8217;s revenue with great prospects of having 30%-40%+ revenue growth for the coming years. At these levels, the company is also a prime candidate for a takeover. If you are an e-commerce player and are looking at the social commerce space which is set to grow for years the price drop in PINS probably gives you one of the best chances to own a vital asset in the social commerce space at a great price. I do not wish for a candidate to buy PINS as I believe the company can compound at a high rate for years without a takeover but the chance for M&amp;A in my view is high right now also because of macro reasons (low-interest rates, FED tapper cycle not yet starting&#8230;).</p><p><strong>Airbnb is coming out of the pandemic as a whole new beast</strong></p><p>Airbnb reported strong numbers for the second quarter:</p><ul><li><p>Nights and Experiences Booked 83.1M up 197% YoY and -1% from 2019</p></li><li><p>Gross Booking Value $13.4B up 320% YoY and up 37% from 2019</p></li><li><p>Revenue&nbsp; $1.3B up 299% YoY and up 10% from 2019</p></li><li><p>Net loss -$68M</p></li><li><p>Adjusted EBITDA $217M</p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e80924a-c30e-4d3a-883f-809a3eeaad8f_727x289.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e80924a-c30e-4d3a-883f-809a3eeaad8f_727x289.png" width="727" height="289" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5e80924a-c30e-4d3a-883f-809a3eeaad8f_727x289.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:289,&quot;width&quot;:727,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:36733,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e80924a-c30e-4d3a-883f-809a3eeaad8f_727x289.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e80924a-c30e-4d3a-883f-809a3eeaad8f_727x289.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e80924a-c30e-4d3a-883f-809a3eeaad8f_727x289.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e80924a-c30e-4d3a-883f-809a3eeaad8f_727x289.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">source: Airbnb Q2 earnings presentation</figcaption></figure></div><p>Now while we expected big numbers compared to the year-ago quarter when covid hit it is nice to see numbers comparing the quarter to the 2019 quarter. The quarter, in general, showed just how much Airbnb is ready to capture the reopening of the economy and the travel industry.</p><p>But the things that stood out to me in the quarter were the following:</p><p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The TAM is expanding and Airbnb is evolving</strong></p><p>The pandemic fueled a new trend in Airbnb&#8217;s business and that is long-term stays. So in reality Airbnb does not only service the travel industry but also the living industry. This is particularly interesting for Airbnb as it is now less dependent on top cities and long-distance travel. The two segments were one of the pillars of their business before the pandemic. Now long term stays and none top city locations are one of their highest growing categories diversifying and with that de-risking the business to some extend.</p><p>Long-term stays (defined as stays of at least 28 nights) remained one of their faster-growing category by trip length. </p><p>Management note on the call:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;And long-term stays (defined as stays of at least 28 nights) remained our fastest-growing category by trip length. Airbnb survey data indicates that people plan to continue to travel and live this way, with 81% of our long-term stay guests in Q2 2021 saying they plan to book another long-term stay in the coming year.&#8221;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&#8220;And one of the elements is that we're seeing the trends of long-term stays which we highlighted as a key strength in Q1, stays of 28 days or longer, remain being one of the largest and strongest growing parts of our business. So that was 19% of our nights booked in Q2 following the 24% in Q1 just as the mix of short-term stays kind of rebounded strongly in Q2&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>With that their already massive travel TAM is expanding:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;In terms of TAM for alternative versus hotels. If you really think about Airbnb, it's not just a travel company. It is all about travel and living. And really any kind of stay, any kind of accommodation really short of kind of a full-year lease can be accommodated with Airbnb. And that's what we're seeing with the fact that we're seeing such strong growth in stays of 28 days or longer. And that that was 19% of nights in Q2. And we highlighted in the letter the fact that even the nights of seven days or longer were 50% of our nights. And so that is not hotels. Hotel average much lower, maybe one to two nights on average. We're going to be four-plus. And 50% of our nights were of seven days or longer.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Covid has strengthened its business</strong></p><p>There are two main things that I see that have happened because of Covid and that has strengthen Airbnb. They noted that because of the pandemic the company put a lot of effort in the year 2020 into effectiveness and flexibility. This means the company has become more effective in allocating its resources and capital because the pandemic forced it to be. In other word cost optimization and with it profitability. The other thing I am seeing is that the platform has become even more sticky for their hosts as host churn was lower both in 2020 and so far in 2021:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;And then, actually, what we've seen with our host churn has actually decreased from what we saw pre-COVID. So it was lower in 2020 than it was in 2019 and it's lower in 2021 than it was in 2020. So the overall churn rate continued to actually decline right now.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bullish Outlook and the opportunity</strong></p><p>On the call, we could see that management is very bullish on the upcoming Q3 quarter stating that it will be their biggest quarter in terms of revenue and EBITDA in their history. </p><blockquote><p>&#8220;While the COVID-19 pandemic creates ongoing uncertainty for our future results, we expect Q3 2021 revenue to be our strongest quarterly revenue on record and to deliver the highest Adjusted EBITDA dollars and margin ever.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>On the other hand, the company still has a big opportunity as so far strength in Q2 was mainly driven by North America and Europe. So other parts of the world are still not where they used to be as the vaccinations and re-openings are having a longer timeline. Another important revenue contributor that hasn&#8217;t returned fully is long-distance travel which before the pandemic contributed to nearly 50% of their revenue. These are two factors that will further strengthen is revenue pipe in the following months.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>While I do expect Airbnb to have a tougher environment in the second half of this year with the Delta Variant spreading at the same time they have shown how resilient their business is and how quickly they can adapt to a changing environment with things like flexible search, long term stays and rural era stays. I also see a company that will be a much stronger company after the end of the pandemic with an even bigger TAM. At the same time, I see Airbnb in a perfect position if a higher inflation environment would present itself. The higher price in bookings and ease of scalability makes it perfect to absorb the whole inflation environment and shield its shareholders. </p><p><strong>Sofi on a steady path</strong></p><p><strong>Sofi earnings numbers:</strong></p><ul><li><p>GAAP net revenue $231.3 million up 101% YoY.

What is very important for me is seeing that loans processes are being more and more automated:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;In Q2 more than 50% of personal loans process were 100% automated. That compares with less than 30% one year ago, which drove lower cost per loan and shortened time to fund to two days from four days last year and nearly a week a few years ago.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>With more automation comes more profit. The loan business main goal in my view is to help the company be more profitable at the moment and we need profit from this business segment to fuel growth in the technology and financial service segment of the business.</p><p>The guidance for Q3 was not what investors were expecting but they still upped the guidance even though they will have some headwinds in the second part of the year because of the extension of the CARES Act on the loan business segment.</p><p><strong>Technology platform &#8211; Galileo</strong></p><p>The technology segment drove strong results. The number of accounts at Galileo more than doubled in the past year growing 119%. Going from 36 million to 79 million this year. Revenue for the business segment was up 138% YoY (although you have to factor in that last year was not a full quarter because Sofi acquired Galileo in May last year).</p><p>Galileo is also doing an important shift from on-premise to cloud. This is very important as it will drive costs significantly down in the future and provide Galileo with bigger flexibility and scalability. It looks like we might see the transition to cloud finishing soon.</p><p>Management on the call:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;At Galileo, we near completion on a 15 month project to build out a new cloud computing environment to replace the on premises environment, and are now in Q3 focused on the migration of existing clients to the cloud, which we filed by onboarding new clients straight to the cloud.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>They are also putting a lot of resources to expand Galileo in terms of the team size and new product offerings. I like this move as Galileo is one of the best assets Sofi has with a great market and potential. Taking profits from the loaning business and putting it into Galileo seems like a wise move.</p><p><strong>Financial service is the clear standout</strong></p><p>The financial service segment with the super app is as expected starting to gain some serious traction:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;As we mentioned on the call, the business really saw a key inflection point in the quarter with revenue up 2.5x Q2 versus Q1. As we're now starting to monetize all that activity&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Net revenues for the segment were $17 million vs 2.4$ million a year ago, the largest driver of that revenue was Sofi Invest.</p><p>The number for Sofi products is also an important metric showing the adoption and usage of the products Sofi offers. Sofi products are the numbers of products a Sofi member has selected on their platform in the reported period. The numbers show adoption is growing fast:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81fd9f2d-866e-4519-a51e-f6f07b80b4b4_903x185.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81fd9f2d-866e-4519-a51e-f6f07b80b4b4_903x185.png" width="903" height="185" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/81fd9f2d-866e-4519-a51e-f6f07b80b4b4_903x185.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:185,&quot;width&quot;:903,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:102757,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81fd9f2d-866e-4519-a51e-f6f07b80b4b4_903x185.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81fd9f2d-866e-4519-a51e-f6f07b80b4b4_903x185.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81fd9f2d-866e-4519-a51e-f6f07b80b4b4_903x185.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81fd9f2d-866e-4519-a51e-f6f07b80b4b4_903x185.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">source: Sofi Q2 earnings presentation</figcaption></figure></div><p>While the segment in terms of revenue is still small the Sofi product count shows it is growing fast and that revenues will soon follow the product count in the coming quarters.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>The flywheel effect that Sofi has placed because of their product portfolio and loan know-how is on the right path. The most interesting and important segments for me as a shareholder are the financial service segment and the technology platform segment. While I do acknowledge the value that Sofi&#8217;s lending business is making I am not a big fan of the loan market. While the quarter didn&#8217;t produce any blowout surprise in terms of numbers it showed that they are executing as planned and my conviction in the stock remains as it was before the results. The stock fell 15% after earnings and is now trading at an $11 billion market cap.</p><p>An important step for them will also be getting a Bank charter. They already applied for it and are working now with regulators on finalizing the process. Management didn&#8217;t give us a deadline on when they expect to finalize the process but as it seems the process is running normally and as a shareholder, I expect they can have it finalized in a few quarters.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I own PINS, ABNB and SOFI in my portfolio.</p><p>Nothing contained in this website and newsletter should be understood as&nbsp;investment or financial advice.

The competition and space, in general, are starting to heat up as more e-commerce companies are noticing the trend from e-commerce to social commerce. With that, we will see more and more fights for social commerce assets and content and with that for content creators.</p><p><strong>Social commerce is heating up in the West </strong></p><p>The social commerce space is really heating up in the last months. Just this year, social commerce sales in the US are forecasted to reach $36 billion, up from $26.7 billion last year, according to eMarketer. The competition in the space is also heating up. A big driver of this move is Facebook with its Shops and driving more and more sales through its Instagram platform. It is starting to scare traditional e-commerce players, and as such, they are looking for assets and partnerships to prepare better to tackle and not miss on the market. </p><p>Etsy recently announced its intention to buy Depop. Depop is social commerce two-sided marketplace that primarily targets Gen Z and millennial customers. Over 90% of Depop users are under the age of 26. Etsy already knows how social assets can drive their revenue as at some point, 40% of their social traffic came from Pinterest. Etsy is also &#8220;paying up&#8221; for the deal as Depop had $70 million in revenue and $650 million in gross merchandise sales in 2020. Etsy is reported to pay $1.625 billion for the company. So roughly 23 times Sales.</p><p>Shopify is also more than ready for the social commerce trend. It is expanding its partnerships with Pinterest and integrating the two platforms for a more seamless experience for the user. Also worth mentioning is that Jeremy Levine is a board member on both Shopify and Pinterest boards.</p><p>Facebook also announced in May a live shopping event taking place every Friday for 2 months. The event will be very interactive will sellers and buyers interactive in real-time.</p><p>On the other hand, the big player Amazon seems to be still sleeping more than not on the social commerce trends. Yes, they launched Amazon Posts, but it doesn&#8217;t seem to be a real step for a company like Amazon, and the traction given the potential of Amazon seems to be on the low side.</p><p>With all the players going at this space, if you are not Facebook, you have to rely and lean on a social platform like Pinterest, which is made for shopping and with a user base of over 400 million that provides the only real competition to Instagram and Facebook&#8217;s other digital assets.</p><p><strong>What is the new driver for PINS?</strong></p><p>Since we are finally moving toward a normal world with covid under control, we have to look at Pinterest going forward. Their recent earnings report scared some investors as they reported a deacceleration in user growth and guided user growth on the low side. While Covid was a big benefactor for PINS in terms of the user growth and engagement rates on stuff like cooking, do it your self-classes, gardening, the recent data from PINS suggest users are still using Pinterest only for different categories. Categories like travel, fashion, weddings, etc. Just recently, the company reported the following:</p><blockquote><p><em>There are now more than 5 billion searches on Pinterest every month. As people prepare for a post-pandemic life,&nbsp;searches for outfits, vacations, and home renovations are at all-time highs, and searches for weddings have presumed pre-pandemic levels.</em></p></blockquote><p>Also, searches for travel are really taking off. For May, Pinterest said that searches for &#8220;dream vacation destinations&#8221; are up 13x while searches for &#8220;luxury vacation&#8221; are up 6x.</p><p>So I do believe that engagement rates and user growth will slow down from covid levels, but I still expect the company to grow in terms of users and their engagements just in different categories than before. People want ideas and to get inspired either if they are at home or if they are out there exploring the world.</p><p><strong>The key thing &#8211; more ads, more users? </strong></p><p>What I really like about the Pinterest platform is that the users don&#8217;t mind ads. In fact, ads are actually wanted. I wrote about this phenomenon in my initial analysis of PINS. And what I find even more interesting and what I think will be the new driver for Pinterest is the shopping features. The more shopping features PINS provides to the users, the more I believe they like the platform. This is because the users use the platform mainly for getting ideas on finding and shopping for products. So saving them time and finding the products they were looking for faster and easier is what they want. </p><p>So in my view, Pinterest shoudn&#8217;t be viewed through the lens of a traditional social media company where more ads mean user frustration and saturation. In this case, I believe that the more Pinterest provides relevant ads, monetizable features, and the more the platform is easier to fulfill the user&#8217;s purpose (that is mainly shopping), the more it can expect to see user growth and engagement growth. From a social media company&#8217;s perspective, this is the dream scenario.</p><p>But if we look at some numbers, this might be playing out already. In April, Pinterest launched Ads in Brazil. Looking at the search result volume for Pinterest in Brazil, we can see that volume has increased since the launch and is at all-time high levels in a 2 year period. </p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3962dd86-9e81-4d92-88e1-26ca8f8424bf_602x318.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3962dd86-9e81-4d92-88e1-26ca8f8424bf_602x318.png" width="602" height="318" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3962dd86-9e81-4d92-88e1-26ca8f8424bf_602x318.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:318,&quot;width&quot;:602,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:23737,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3962dd86-9e81-4d92-88e1-26ca8f8424bf_602x318.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3962dd86-9e81-4d92-88e1-26ca8f8424bf_602x318.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3962dd86-9e81-4d92-88e1-26ca8f8424bf_602x318.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3962dd86-9e81-4d92-88e1-26ca8f8424bf_602x318.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><em>source: Google trends</em></p><p>Now to get a confirmation of this trend, we will have to wait for Pinterest earnings results and engagement numbers. Still, with PINS launching so many new features to amplify the social commerce experience, we might need to wait too long to see the results of this thesis play out.</p><p><strong>Future of search &amp; PINS is visual shopping with LENS</strong></p><p>A very important path PINS is taking is the visual search and video path. They launched two important features. The first is; Idea Pins. It is a video-first feature aimed at creators. The feature is basically for creators who want to tell their stories via video, music, and editing tools. It is very similar to TikTok. With this feature, PINS can now add more social elements between users to the platform that were maybe missing on the platform since you want your users to follow other users and to be active on the platform for a longer period. It is a feature that makes the platform more attractive for creators and thus more appropriate for companies that want to advertise via influencer marketing strategies. More about the Idea Pin can be found here: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/pinterest-introduces-idea-pins-a-video-first-feature-aimed-at-creators/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Pinterest introduces Idea Pins, a video-first feature aimed at creators | TechCrunch</a></p><p>The other important feature is the Shop tab on the Lens visual search tool. Now users can basically take a picture of a product, and they won&#8217;t only get search results for products similar to the one they took the picture, but they have a direct tab with shoppable pins. This means that the experience of shopping via visual search is even more seamless. This is an important step, especially for the fashion and home d&#233;cor segment, as I see this widely being used by individuals and many interior designers to save them time and offer their clients more tailored products. </p><p>The evolution of e-commerce away from text and into visual is what we can expect in the next years, and visual search and AR features are the things that will drive it. Pinterest seems to understand this fully and is taking the right steps.</p><p><strong>Need to do more on content</strong></p><p>With all the trends around social commerce and influencer marketing, social media companies and e-commerce companies are now in a race to gain the attention and adoption of influencers and creators. But these are not only big influencers that most of us know, but these are small, also called micro-influencers, who have a smaller following but more genuine relationships with their followers. The industry has acknowledged that these are key for driving sales, and with that, there is now a global fight for creators. Creators and influencers that provide content to the platforms and attract users. Pinterest in April announced their first Creator Fund that will help creators get started on their platform, especially creators from underrepresented groups. The fund size is $500k. While this is an important step in the right direction, in my view, it is not nearly enough. The fight for creators is real, and PINS is an important player in this space and should increase the fund size and go hands-on with the fight for creators. Just for comparisons other social media companies and their creator funds:</p><p>TikTok- $200 million (and pledged $2 billion)</p><p>Youtube - $100 million</p><p>Snapchat &#8211; reportedly spend $130 million (since November financing contributors on its short-form feature &#8220;Spotlight.&#8221;)</p><p>Having creators on your platform will be key for you as a platform to keep your users engaged and active. This is especially important as many social media platforms have a harder time getting new users as their active user bases are bigger and bigger. The user growth slows because you have fewer people you can reach that aren&#8217;t your users yet. So engagement is what you need to focus on when you are in a more mature phase of a social media company.</p><p>This is a segment where I expect PINS to lift their efforts more and make it so that creators, especially in certain categories that PINS dominates, will have PINS as their default platform.</p><p><strong>Revenue &amp; user growth metrics development </strong></p><p>PINS has been one of those companies that have accelerated on all fronts in this pandemic, and now when we see the world slowly returning to normal, the last earnings reports give us some clues of what we can expect from Pinterest.</p><p>First and foremost, a slower pace of user growth. While user growth was up big in 2020, it was expected that user growth would stabilize in PINS as it did with all social media companies. In Q1 2021, MAU grew 30% YoY to 478 million, which was slower than previous quarters, but what really spoked investors was the guidance for Q2 MAU growth. In Q2, PINS expects MAU to grow in the mid-teens and US MAU to be flat on a YoY basis. While US MAU being flat is expected (US MAU has been steady since Q3 2020 at 98 million), a mid-teen global MAU growth on a YoY basis means that Pinterest expects international MAU growth to be flat in Q2 2021 compared to Q1 2021. </p><p>Now I want to be clear that it will be really important for me in the next quarters what PINS reports regarding international MAU. If we see flat user growth compared to previous quarters and if this lasts more than perhaps one or two quarters, that would definitely be a negative for me as it would potentially show that PINS is hitting on the ceiling of their user base. But if this is only for a quarter or two, it just shows that the pandemic pulled some demand forward but that the PINS user base can still grow and continue to attract new users.</p><p>And so far, I believe in the pull of demand thesis. Pinterest mentioned a lot of how they see new users from the Gen-Z generation stay on the platform and use it for not just shopping but also for ideas on where to travel etc. If PINS adds to their existing user base the Gen-Z generation, it could further drive their user growth for years to come. But what I really believe will drive the next momentum in user growth and already explained in this article is PINS making the platform more &#8220;shoppable.&#8221; All the shopping features improve the user experience and make the PINS platform more relevant with a clear sense of purpose &#8211; ideas on what to shop for.</p><p>If we move the discussion and focus on revenue, Pinterest&#8217;s latest quarter showed a 78% revenue growth YoY, and their guidance for Q2 is 105%. But with the guidance, you have to factor in that the Q2 2020 was a quarter where everything stopped, and PINS revenue growth compared to Q2 2019 r was just 4%. So the YoY comparison is much easier to beat this year. If we exclude that effect, the revenue guidance continues to show a stellar 70%+ revenue growth that has been going on since Q4 2020.</p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F788910dc-04fd-4783-9775-f467010132e5_602x445.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F788910dc-04fd-4783-9775-f467010132e5_602x445.png" width="602" height="445" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/788910dc-04fd-4783-9775-f467010132e5_602x445.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:445,&quot;width&quot;:602,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:67632,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F788910dc-04fd-4783-9775-f467010132e5_602x445.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F788910dc-04fd-4783-9775-f467010132e5_602x445.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F788910dc-04fd-4783-9775-f467010132e5_602x445.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F788910dc-04fd-4783-9775-f467010132e5_602x445.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>source: Pinterest earnings report</p><p>I believe the high revenue growth will continue as PINS is rolling out more and more features that help the platform be more monetizable and expand the shopping experience for the users. I am also not worried about ARPU reaching a peak because PINS demographics and user behavior, as already explained in my first analysis of PINS, are unique where users actually want ads as they came on the platform to shop. With the demographic, that has a lot of spending household power (young women). An important feature that is helping them propel their revenue growth is also the newly introduced auto-bidding option, where advertisers can now more efficiently put ads on the platform (remember, a similar thing happened with Facebook). The results of the auto-bidding feature are already showing results, as PINS explained in their last earnings call.</p><p><strong>Pinterest undervalued compared to its peers</strong></p><p>Now on the valuation part. First looking at multiples to forward revenue. Pinterest is trading at around 16.3 times Sales which is substantially less than Snapchat (24.33) but is bigger than Facebook (10.05). Interestingly, the valuation gap between Snapchat and Pinterest regarding forward P/S is the widest it has been in a while. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4e4266b-a3dd-4b8b-b63b-e2986f738b31_723x453.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4e4266b-a3dd-4b8b-b63b-e2986f738b31_723x453.png" width="723" height="453" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f4e4266b-a3dd-4b8b-b63b-e2986f738b31_723x453.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:453,&quot;width&quot;:723,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:74354,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4e4266b-a3dd-4b8b-b63b-e2986f738b31_723x453.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4e4266b-a3dd-4b8b-b63b-e2986f738b31_723x453.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4e4266b-a3dd-4b8b-b63b-e2986f738b31_723x453.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4e4266b-a3dd-4b8b-b63b-e2986f738b31_723x453.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>source: Ycharts</p><p>But the real value for me is to value platforms through their users.

While a Snapchat user is worth $190 and a Facebook user is worth $274. Now, this is where I disagree with the market valuation. I think a Pinterest user is much more valuable than, for example, a Snapchat user. Pinterest users have bigger spending power, their intention on the platform is more orientated towards shopping and spending money as opposed to just having fun, and Pinterest users are more likely to spend larger amounts for items because they are mostly young women where they are either building their home, shopping for kid stuff or spending on clothes and fashion accessories. For example, teenagers that are Snapchat&#8217;s dominant user base have much lower income (with that spending power), and they are more likely given their life position to spend lower amounts in their current state. Not to mention that teenagers tend to change their minds about things they like quickly, and with that, you have a genuine risk that when that user becomes more mature, they won&#8217;t be using the platform anymore.</p><p>I believe the market is undervaluing the Pinterest user, although I think it is the most monetizable platform of all the above. Even if we went conservative and would put a fair value of a Pinterest user in the value of Twitter user at $136, the company should then be trading at around $65 billion, which is around the $100 per share mark and not at $42B or $66 per share where it is trading now.</p><p>Pinterest, when compared to all three other social media companies, has also had the biggest revenue and user growth in the past year, so the undervaluation compared to the peers by the market seems unjustified.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>All in all, I think Pinterest is a great company to capture the social commerce trends that are unfolding and is not just a pandemic one-shot story. It is also one of the rare digital assets where monetization and user experience correlate positively with each other. On the valuation side, even if user growth were to slow substantially, the existing user base of PINS is vastly undervalued compared to its peers. That is why Pinterest is one of my main portfolio positions.</p><p>If you liked this article, you can subscribe to my newsletter.

This is their &#8220;classic&#8221; ride-hailing segment. </p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Delivery. This started as Uber Eats but since then includes the likes of Postmates, Cornershop, Drizly, etc. </p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freight. This is the smallest of the three segments but nonetheless still very important. Taking care of Shipping and Hauling.</p><p><strong>Mobility unit</strong></p><p><strong>Performance of Mobility and the COVID effect</strong></p><p>Uber&#8217;s mobility unit consists of services like ride-hailing and other mobility services. It is one of the biggest mobility providers in the world. Their market approach is very straightforward. They want to be the number 1 or 2 provider of mobility in terms of the market share in a specific region. And they have done that successfully so far:</p><p>They have an over 65% market share in US&amp;CA, LatAM, Europe, ANZ, MEA, and around 50% market share in India.</p><p>The key for them to have a big market share in mobility is because this is how you achieve profitability in this market, with the economy of scale.</p><p>Uber has, over the last few years, experiences great growth in its Mobility business segment. In 2 years (from 2017 to 2019), the number of trips per quarter nearly doubled from 1B in Q4 2017 to almost 2B in Q4 2019.</p><p>But then COVID came and hit this business segment hard.</p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6605fca-4721-4f77-aae0-01debb254001_414x376.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6605fca-4721-4f77-aae0-01debb254001_414x376.png" width="414" height="376" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b6605fca-4721-4f77-aae0-01debb254001_414x376.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:376,&quot;width&quot;:414,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:45564,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6605fca-4721-4f77-aae0-01debb254001_414x376.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6605fca-4721-4f77-aae0-01debb254001_414x376.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6605fca-4721-4f77-aae0-01debb254001_414x376.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6605fca-4721-4f77-aae0-01debb254001_414x376.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">source: Uber earnings report</figcaption></figure></div><p>Mobility Gross Bookings were down to as much as -73% in Q2 2020 compared to Q2 2019.

And it has the perfect setup to continue executing and building business segments around this super transport app. They can now leverage their user base on the Mobility and Delivery side and have synergies between these users. With that, they can lower their CAC (client acquisition costs) and boost their profitability. They also recently launched Uber membership, a subscription service that helps users benefit and use the different varieties of their services while getting discounts and other perks. The end goal for them is that users use the whole portfolio of their product and become hooked on one transport platform.</p><p>The numbers for Uber memberships are rising fast. In 2020 they launched it in 16 countries, and they already have more than 5 million members. While most of these members are in the US, the opportunity for further expansion on this segment is high with new countries rolling in 2021 and with more users willing to use the app for both Delivery and also Mobility. The management also noted this at the Truist Securities Technology, Internet &amp; Services Conference:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8220;Yes, we haven't, but what we have said is the U.S. is a majority of that 5 million. A good majority of that is the U.S., primarily because that's where we've had it for the longest. And all the international markets we expanded to were in Q4. So you should imagine that, that's a small contribution at this point.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>This cross-platform selling has already started to show results, as they noted in their last Q4:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;We also disclosed that close to 10% of our Uber Eats first trips came through the Uber rider app in Q4. Over time, I think it brings down our user acquisition cost, which gives us a P&amp;L advantage.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>And the platform of Uber is not small in any regard.</p><p>In 2020 even with the pandemic, they had 93 million monthly active platform customers.</p><p>While Uber doesn&#8217;t break down the numbers of monthly active platform customers for each business segment based on the gross bookings for each segment this is my calculation of the user segment breakdown:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66d07c22-abe5-46cb-a110-f101e1825bc0_375x97.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66d07c22-abe5-46cb-a110-f101e1825bc0_375x97.png" width="375" height="97" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/66d07c22-abe5-46cb-a110-f101e1825bc0_375x97.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:97,&quot;width&quot;:375,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:34685,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66d07c22-abe5-46cb-a110-f101e1825bc0_375x97.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66d07c22-abe5-46cb-a110-f101e1825bc0_375x97.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66d07c22-abe5-46cb-a110-f101e1825bc0_375x97.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66d07c22-abe5-46cb-a110-f101e1825bc0_375x97.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">source: Uber data and own calculation</figcaption></figure></div><p>When the world returns to a somewhat normal state after the pandemic, I estimate that Uber could reach 120M monthly active platform users out of that 84M on the Mobility and 36M on the Delivery side. This estimation considers that the Mobility unit MAU are back to 2019 levels, but I think they may even be higher at the end of 2021 (more in the segment &#8220;why I invested&#8221;) and that the Delivery segment MAU stabilizes at this levels. To put that in perspective, that number would be over a third of the MAU of a social media platform like Twitter.</p><p><strong>Why I invested?</strong></p><p><strong>The platform and the market potential</strong></p><p>Where Uber is going in the last few years and where I think their biggest potential lies is in their technology and their app. I like to invest in companies that build a platform with active users and how the companies can cross-sell services and products and expand their TAM. And I think Uber is at a perfect stop to do so in being the transportation leader via mobility and delivery in the future.</p><p>They are one of those companies that has the biggest TAM&#8217;s out there. Their earnings reports estimated the Mobility TAM at +$5T, Delivery at +$5T, and Freight at $3.8T. Mobility and Deliver are one of the world's biggest markets, and if they continue to execute well, I don&#8217;t see their growth stopping anytime soon.</p><p><strong>Perfect hedge &#8211; dual segment business</strong></p><p>Another big advantage I see in Uber&#8217;s business is that their Mobility and Delivery business segments are a perfect hedge in the covid world. Right now, we are seeing vaccine rollouts and things slowly getting back to normal. Still, nobody knows how long it will take or, god forbid, if we could get another bump in the road to recovery with the different covid strains and the vaccine effectiveness. But with Uber, the business has a dual segment business where you can expect growth in any scenario. Thus, the cash flow from one part of the business can help the other one survive through a rough environment.</p><p><strong>People&#8217;s habits after COVID</strong></p><p>I also think that people after covid will be more open to ride-hailing than public transportation because of the safety concerns and a more comfortable feeling. Uber Andrew Macdonald, Senior Vice President of Mobility and Business Operations  also said this in his remarks on the Truist Securities Technology, Internet &amp; Services Conference  conference:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;So a city like Sao Paulo, which is one of our largest cities globally -- there's neighborhoods that are way ahead of where they were pre-COVID. And what we're seeing in those neighborhoods is people move from public transit to Uber because they feel safer&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;And I also think similar movements will happen with people who will go to airports, preferring ride-hailing than train or bus.</p><p>So I think Uber will benefit compared to other transportation ways after covid similar to what I believe Airbnb will benefit compared to big hotel chains. </p><p><strong>Cost management &#8211; profitability, autonomous driving segment</strong></p><p>With Uber, a big concert for me for years has been profitability and cost management. But they have changed my mind lately and shown me that Uber can become profitable and that they are focusing on doing that. Management acknowledges that cost management is one of their priorities. In the long run, they don&#8217;t want to be a heavy Capex spending company, but more a technology platform with high margins.</p><p>The mobility unit would be already profitable if it weren&#8217;t for covid in 2020. Now, because of the covid boost, the delivery business is very close to it. Now I can finally see profitability in the next 2-3 years kicking on the door, and with their economy of scale, I see they made a perfect setup to scale this and grow further.</p><p>Another thing that I liked, even though it received a lot of controversies, is the selling of their autonomous driving segment to Aurora. Despite some investors arguing about this move, I don&#8217;t want Uber to develop and burn money for autonomous driving. Why?</p><p>First of all, the amount of cash burn was a heavy burden on the whole business. Looking at how much this segment burned money from the R&amp;D, it was more than half a billion dollars yearly. I really think Uber should focus more on their brand and the platform and how to keep the users happy and engaged than to focus on stuff like autonomous driving. I think that they will adopt autonomous cars, which should improve their margins even more, but I don&#8217;t believe they need to be the company developing this technology to the fullest. For autonomous cars to gain popularity and adoption, the price at which whoever makes and sells the best system won&#8217;t be high and won&#8217;t be very profitable as they have to get the scale and adoption. So I actually think selling their autonomous segment to Aurora and receiving a significant 26% equity stake in Aurora is the smartest thing they could have done. It also allows them to be independent now and adopt any autonomous car provider out there and use their cars in the future, which is an important aspect as it will affect their business's satisfaction rate &#8211; that is, providing mobility to users.</p><p>And this is the key thing for me that Andrew Macdonald also noted:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;I think it's unlikely we would want to operate our own fleets. We traditionally don't want to be in the capital-intensive part of the value chain, and that's not our core capability&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>And this gives me confidence that Uber&#8217;s next 5 years will be one of the &#8220;golden years&#8221; for the company and for the stock, as they will enhance their revenue growth and scale with profitability and monetization, and the market will reward them for it.</p><p>Even if we look at the biggest acquisitions for Uber in the last years, we can see a clear shift from spending M&amp;A on the autonomous vehicle part to spending and making acquisitions to enhance and improve the user experience, offering, and scale the platform.</p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F987e5bc0-210a-4c99-b2a6-f74d9c2be66f_529x149.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F987e5bc0-210a-4c99-b2a6-f74d9c2be66f_529x149.png" width="529" height="149" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/987e5bc0-210a-4c99-b2a6-f74d9c2be66f_529x149.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:149,&quot;width&quot;:529,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:54359,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F987e5bc0-210a-4c99-b2a6-f74d9c2be66f_529x149.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F987e5bc0-210a-4c99-b2a6-f74d9c2be66f_529x149.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F987e5bc0-210a-4c99-b2a6-f74d9c2be66f_529x149.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F987e5bc0-210a-4c99-b2a6-f74d9c2be66f_529x149.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><strong>Financials and valuation</strong></p><p>Now let&#8217;s look at the financials of Uber.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5a0223c-6fd5-4f43-9bd1-0ea170a67c5f_520x547.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5a0223c-6fd5-4f43-9bd1-0ea170a67c5f_520x547.png" width="520" height="547" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c5a0223c-6fd5-4f43-9bd1-0ea170a67c5f_520x547.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:547,&quot;width&quot;:520,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:150940,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5a0223c-6fd5-4f43-9bd1-0ea170a67c5f_520x547.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5a0223c-6fd5-4f43-9bd1-0ea170a67c5f_520x547.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5a0223c-6fd5-4f43-9bd1-0ea170a67c5f_520x547.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5a0223c-6fd5-4f43-9bd1-0ea170a67c5f_520x547.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">source: Uber earnings report</figcaption></figure></div><p>We can see that their revenue in 2020 dropped almost - 15% because of the covid pandemic and the drop in revenue in the Mobility unit. If Uber weren&#8217;t so diversified and had their Delivery and Freight business segment, this drop would be much more substantial. We would be talking about a totally different business, not a platform but just a ride-hailing business.</p><p>The most important takeaways from the P&amp;L part of the financials for me is the drop in sales and marketing and the drop in R&amp;D. The sales and marketing is important to see as even though Mobility was a part where it didn&#8217;t make much sense to spend on marketing on Delivery they were aggressive and took advantage of the market opportunity. The drop in marketing and sales cost shows that the economy of scale is starting to work on both of their biggest business segments and that CAC is dropping. I further expect the CAC to drop as they will be able to monetize a user inside their super app better on multiple business segments.</p><p>Another important read is the drop in R&amp;D expenses. While this is normally a red flag for me when looking at a growth company (I want to see growth companies investing more in the future), I am fully on board with Uber on lowering the R&amp;D. The main drop in R&amp;D is because they no longer invest in their autonomous vehicle segment. As explained already in this article, I think they understood that for AV to get fully mainstream, there will be a lot more money to spend and that even that might not get you the return you were looking for to achieve a good return on the AV investment.</p><p>Now, let&#8217;s move to the balance sheet:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ab86fd9-0607-4336-bae7-fb2f36351078_495x459.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ab86fd9-0607-4336-bae7-fb2f36351078_495x459.png" width="495" height="459" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7ab86fd9-0607-4336-bae7-fb2f36351078_495x459.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:459,&quot;width&quot;:495,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:117905,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ab86fd9-0607-4336-bae7-fb2f36351078_495x459.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ab86fd9-0607-4336-bae7-fb2f36351078_495x459.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ab86fd9-0607-4336-bae7-fb2f36351078_495x459.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ab86fd9-0607-4336-bae7-fb2f36351078_495x459.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>What is important to check on the balance sheet is their short-term ability to finance themselves. So looking at the current assets, although they dropped significantly in 2020, they still stand at $9.8B while their short-term liabilities stand at $6.8B. So even if market conditions got a lot worse, Uber would not have short-term problems. With that said, given current market conditions, Uber is well capable of getting favorable financing if they needed it.</p><p>I also marked a thing that I don&#8217;t like. They increased their Goodwill from $167 million to $6.1B. The goodwill represents the value of a brand that a company can put on its balance sheet. Most of the time, in my view, Goodwills are more there to inflate the assets. I acknowledge the power of brands and their weight, especially for companies like Apple, but I don&#8217;t like to see this asset too inflated on smaller companies. Uber valuing its brand at $6B seems reasonable to me as their brand is one of the most known brands for transportation in the world. But just to understand that when I check the balance sheet, I normally deduct the Goodwill that a company states.</p><p>The main take from the P&amp;L statement and the balance sheet is that they managed to really stabilize their revenue drop in 2020 through diversified business segments and at the same time make a huge step forward to long-term profitability and sustainability. Looking at their balance sheet, they are more than able to finance their operation further in the short run successfully.</p><p><strong>Valuation</strong></p><p>So if we look at Uber from a valuation point of view, the price has appreciated substantially in the last few months, but we can see that the forward P/S multiple remain stable around the 4-5x Sales.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2700faa6-a8f5-441f-b38e-d7b48a39b088_598x397.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2700faa6-a8f5-441f-b38e-d7b48a39b088_598x397.png" width="598" height="397" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2700faa6-a8f5-441f-b38e-d7b48a39b088_598x397.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:397,&quot;width&quot;:598,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:68752,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2700faa6-a8f5-441f-b38e-d7b48a39b088_598x397.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2700faa6-a8f5-441f-b38e-d7b48a39b088_598x397.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2700faa6-a8f5-441f-b38e-d7b48a39b088_598x397.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2700faa6-a8f5-441f-b38e-d7b48a39b088_598x397.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">source: <a href="https://ycharts.com/dashboard/">Ycharts</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>While it is hard to know what the right multiple for Uber in this point of this should be a peer analysis of two of Uber&#8217;s biggest competitors on different business segments Lyft and DoorDash, shows that if Uber is a mix of both these two businesses, its valuation is at a discount compared to both looking at the forward P/S ratio.

Going from a heavily Capex spending business into a lean technology platform. Building out a super transportation app platform with a high number of users and then using that to lower CAC and cross-sell products with a higher margin is the kind of business that fits into my investment scope and philosophy.</p><p>I believe the pandemic has helped Uber boost its Delivery business speeding it up (was expected 3-5 years before the pandemic has been achieved in one year).&nbsp; On the other side, I think the end of the pandemic will help its Mobility business because of changed user habits. Uber is one of those companies that will come out of this pandemic as a much more efficient and lean company ready to scale its technology and platform. They have also started doing things we haven&#8217;t touched in this analysis, like Uber ads, etc. With all the above, their TAM is truly one of the biggest on the market.</p><p>I will be doing a Q&amp;A session with paying subscribers on the 25th of March regarding this Uber analysis and also sharing some other information that was not included in this analysis, like my view on issues of Uber regarding the employment of drivers, etc. If you are a paid subscriber, please send your question by the 23rd of March, and I will be posting a special follow-up analysis answering the questions that were submitted for paid subscribers.

It is how Square started. The seller ecosystem started from a simple idea of easily handling card payments by businesses from customers. Since then, the ecosystem has evolved completely, and now Square offers solutions such as online store creation, checkout links, contactless payment options, e-commerce APIs, POS services, and hardware. They also offer services to businesses such as business loans, fund transfers, payroll services, and very popular lately business debit card.</p><p>Square B2B business has been affected by the recent pandemic as a lot of their customers on the POS side had to stop their businesses. But on the other side, a lot of their online business grew because businesses were moving online and using Square online services.</p><p>At first glance, you might think that this business segment constitutes a lot of hardware sales, but in fact, Square B2B &nbsp;has grown to a fully grown service business, with hardware sales representing a minority of the total revenue generated by this segment. In fact, in the last reported Q3 2020 quarter. Hardware sales were only $27 million out of $965 million that the whole segment generated. So less than 3%. </p><p><strong>Performance of the segment</strong></p><p>Despite the effects of the pandemic, the segment is performing well, with online businesses adopting more and more of their features and upsetting the loss of revenue generated from on-sight business solutions (such as POS).</p><p>In the last quarter, revenue from the seller ecosystem generated $965 million in revenue compared to $918 million in the same period last year. So despite the pandemic, the business segment grew 5% YoY. The main driver for the growth was Transaction-based revenue representing over 87% of the segment revenue now. On the Transaction based revenue side, the segment that is most interesting to me is this one:</p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd14c36d2-5df1-4ee6-962e-460d32e70a65_272x76.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd14c36d2-5df1-4ee6-962e-460d32e70a65_272x76.png" width="272" height="76" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d14c36d2-5df1-4ee6-962e-460d32e70a65_272x76.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:76,&quot;width&quot;:272,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:24814,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd14c36d2-5df1-4ee6-962e-460d32e70a65_272x76.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd14c36d2-5df1-4ee6-962e-460d32e70a65_272x76.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd14c36d2-5df1-4ee6-962e-460d32e70a65_272x76.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd14c36d2-5df1-4ee6-962e-460d32e70a65_272x76.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><em>Source: Square Q3 earnings report</em></p><p>But also on their Subscription revenue, despite it dipping 6% YoY, the dip was related to Square Capital offering fewer loans while other subscription services grew 28% YoY.</p><p>Another positive factor is Square&#8217;s business debit card offering. Many businesses found out that getting funds as fast as possible is an important thing, and now Square noted that 50% of new clients that come to Square B2B offering in 1-month order also Square Business Debit card.</p><p>Looking at this segment, I can&#8217;t shake off the feeling that I am looking at a well counter correlated business that looks to some extend similar to Disney. While the pandemic hurt parts of Square&#8217;s B2B business in terms of POS (like Disney theme parks), it accelerated the online parts of Square&#8217;s B2B offering like Square online and eCommerce API (similar to Disney+).</p><p><strong>Valuation</strong></p><p>Looking at trying to value this segment. First of all, we have to acknowledge that it is not a hardware company as less than 3% of the business segment revenue comes from hardware. In fact, Square is losing money on the hardware segment as hardware is a way to gain new clients to start using Square business services.</p><p>If we look at the recent data, the business is on track to generate around $3.7B in revenue annually. While in the last 9 months from Q3, the YoY growth was 0%, with the pandemic stabilizing, we can expect the numbers in terms of revenue growth to start rising again in 2021. The last quarter showed a 5% growth, but I think it is safe to assume once also the POS business starts getting back to normal, we can expect revenue growth to be in the 10-20% range. The business also generates a 45-50% gross margin, which is not extremely high but still very healthy (for comparison, Twillio generates a 50-55% Gross margin).</p><p>With 10-20% revenue growth and a 50% gross margin applying a P/S ratio of 15 would be more than appropriate given current market conditions. With that multiple, the Seller ecosystem segment is worth $55.5B.</p><p><strong>Cash App</strong></p><p><strong>What is Cash App</strong></p><p>I will not go deep into what Cash App is and what they offer because I think most people are familiar with it, and it would add no value. I think it is important to highlight from this Fin-Tech wallet product that they have evolved far more than just P2P payments and basically build out a Fintech bank out of Cash App (very similar to SoFI). So the main drivers for revenue growth for CashApp are monetizing products such as brokerage, investing, crypto investing, direct deposits, debit cards, etc. The P2P transactions feature of CashApp actually makes a loss for Square. They say it is their marketing cost and helps them with onboarding new clients. </p><p><strong>Performance of the segment</strong></p><p>The CashApp is a real monster when it comes to FinTech super apps. The last number on the active user count is over 30 million users. Although some reports say, they already had over 40 million users in 2020. The app is offered in the US, Canada, UK, Australia, and Japan. Although not all features that are in the US are available in the other countries. The number of users is growing quickly as in 2017, it was reported that they only had 7 million active users. </p><p>In the pandemic, it seems CashApp has only accelerated growth as drivers such as a younger investor joining the stock market and stimulus checks have really helped the quicker adoption of the app. In the last quarter (Q3 2020), the company reported that daily transactions doubled compared to last year and that the stock brokerage is the best product in terms of performance from the first months since launching a product.</p><p>There is also a clear trend that people are not using CashApp just for P2P anymore, and daily activities are increasing fast in the last years:</p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb040f511-22b3-4506-970c-8f2254974627_325x225.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb040f511-22b3-4506-970c-8f2254974627_325x225.png" width="325" height="225" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b040f511-22b3-4506-970c-8f2254974627_325x225.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:225,&quot;width&quot;:325,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:18090,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb040f511-22b3-4506-970c-8f2254974627_325x225.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb040f511-22b3-4506-970c-8f2254974627_325x225.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb040f511-22b3-4506-970c-8f2254974627_325x225.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb040f511-22b3-4506-970c-8f2254974627_325x225.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><em>Source: Square Q3 earnings report</em></p><p>It is also important to note that Bitcoin is a big part of CashApp as well.

What is even more interesting is that last year the cost of revenue for this segment for the same period was $63 million, with revenue only at $279 million. This shows how much more profitable Cash App is becoming with scale. </p><p>While Square does note that the last results are somewhat elevated because people receive stimulus checks on their Cash App accounts, the trend cannot be denied.</p><p>Cash App hasn&#8217;t even rolled out features like loans. So far, it is testing offering small loans to a small number of accounts, but looking down the line, they can fully replace what a bank offers nowadays and more.</p><p>In these times, we can clearly see that a younger generation of people investing and using financial services is here to stay, and Cash App, together with some other FinTech products, is their go-to platform.</p><p><strong>Competitors on Cash App</strong></p><p>Ok, so looking at the competition, there are quite a lot of Fin-Tech apps out there. The main competitors for me are Venmo, Zelle, and SoFi.</p><p>In terms of Venmo, if we had this conversation 1 or 2 years ago, my thought might be different, but now I think Venmo is starting to lose the race against Cash App.</p><p>The main reason Cash App is performing better, in my opinion, is because it offers more features (and offers them sooner than competitors). The way Square is looking at P2P (merily as a source to gain new customers) is the right way. With Venmo, there are still a lot of people using it only because of P2P. The other thing is Cash App is so aggressive in marketing. In fact, I would argue their marketing is one of the best I have seen. And another important fact to consider is that because of Square&#8217;s B2B business, Cash App can offer perks to their users such as Boosts or discounts for places such as restaurants or bars. An interesting feature is also that you can receive your paycheck directly to Cash App.</p><p>This chart also shines some light as we can see that Cash App has really outperformed Venmo since April 2020 in terms of search in the US.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a9ca336-09cc-48b8-8002-131279ff18db_752x397.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a9ca336-09cc-48b8-8002-131279ff18db_752x397.png" width="752" height="397" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4a9ca336-09cc-48b8-8002-131279ff18db_752x397.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:397,&quot;width&quot;:752,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:40750,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a9ca336-09cc-48b8-8002-131279ff18db_752x397.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a9ca336-09cc-48b8-8002-131279ff18db_752x397.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a9ca336-09cc-48b8-8002-131279ff18db_752x397.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a9ca336-09cc-48b8-8002-131279ff18db_752x397.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><em>Source: Google trends</em></p><p>When looking at SoFi, they have a much lower user base so far, but the main thing Square must watch out for is the fact that SoFi also offers loans to their clients. This is a business segment in which SoFi has experience because of its core business. But with Square testing the loan feature already, I think they will be able to roll this feature out soon.</p><p>An important milestone for Cash App will also be an expansion into Europe. And while there are many smaller competitors in Europe, Square is taking the first steps in the market. In their last earnings call, they told us that they recently acquired a Spanish startup called Verse to learn about the market. So it seems expansion into Europe is not far away.</p><p><strong>Valuation</strong></p><p>Valuing Cash App is a more challenging task. Normally I would look at the active user number and user growth, and the value of one user in the fin-tech space. But since we don&#8217;t have accurate information on this part, we can only value it through current financial numbers. This means that we take into account only the products and services that the company is currently offering and do not take into account the potential of new products the company can offer to increase the ARPU.</p><p>The numbers show us that Cash App revenue on an annual basis should be around $1.7B, they have a crazy gross margin of over 80%, and they are growing 150%. While it is hard to estimate if this company was trading as a stand-alone company I think at current market conditions, the market would easily apply a 50 times P/S multiple, given the high margin, high growth rate, and fintech space. The estimated value of this business given these multiples would then be $85B.</p><p><strong>Synergies between both ecosystems</strong></p><p>While I evaluated both of Square&#8217;s business segments separately, both businesses combined offer many synergies and support each other. To provide some examples.</p><p>Companies that use the Square seller ecosystem can pay their employees directly to Cash App. This can motivate employees to open a Cash App account and get their salary faster.</p><p>Square can leverage their Cash App user base and provide their corporate clients access to Cash App users. The corporate clients get to offer their products and services to the whole Cash App ecosystem. </p><p><strong>Company valuation</strong></p><p>According to this analysis, the Seller ecosystem is worth $55.5B and the Cash App ecosystem $85B. If Square pays off all their liabilities, they are left with $0.5B in short-term liquid assets that we have to add. So the target value for SQ given all the above would be $141B or $312 per share. The stock is currently trading at $240.38 per share and a $108.4B market cap.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>I think Square is in a unique position right now and has a competitive advantage, especially in the FinTech wallet space. The Cash App ecosystem will probably be one of the most important for them also going further but their B2B segment compliments their offering and provides good synergies. International expansion has just started in Square and will be a nice growth generator for the coming years.</p><p>Even though the stock had a nice run, I think the run is justified as their performance, especially in 2020, highlights their strong market position and I believe in the company long term.</p><p>If you liked this analysis and are interested in others, please subscribe to this newsletter; it is free.

I did several Pinterest analyses and shared it with UncoverAlpha subscribers back in the day when this was a $20 stock, but I feel it&#8217;s the right time to give you an update and maybe even dive deeper into some of my investment thesis points.</p><ol><li><p><strong>The story of how it began</strong></p></li></ol><p>Pinterest was founded back in 2010 by Ben Silbermann, Evan Sharp, and Paul Sciarra. What you may not know or expect is that Pinterest, when it launched, didn&#8217;t skyrocket right away. In fact, after 4 months of its launch, Pinterest had only 200 users. Because of the low userbase unconventional social media approach (no news feed etc.) and founders without an engineering background, they had trouble getting fundraising. </p><p>Pinterest was also for 2 years after launching an invite-only platform. That limited its potential for user growth but allowed the founders to build out an initial community and prepare the product for international success.</p><ol start="2"><li><p><strong>The Platform</strong></p></li></ol><p>Now Pinterest is one of the biggest social media companies in the world. The platform is primarily designed for people to search for ideas, inspirations, hobbies, and passions. Thus, the users that come to the platform are much more focused on what they want to get from using it. This has increased in the COVID era, as we can see from Pinterest&#8217;s latest remarks on their Q3 earnings call:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve learned more about the users who began using Pinterest during the COVID-19 period. First, their engagement tends to increase when lockdown orders are in effect and wane when the orders are lifted. Second, they typically come to Pinterest for a specific purpose (e.g., building a home office) rather than for general inspiration. This means they tend to search more than older cohorts, a new-user trend that pre-dates COVID but that has accelerated since March. More searching on the platform raises the bar on serving relevant results (particularly more relevant ads), but search engagement also tends to have higher commercial intent, which represents a big opportunity for future growth, particularly as advertisers increasingly seek platforms that are able to deliver sales and conversions.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>With that in mind, Pinterest is the perfect social commerce company. Its main growth opportunity, in my opinion, is its ability to feed and connect with e-commerce and present people with a perfect online shopping experience.</p><p>The platform also has a much more friendly vibe than many other social media platforms as people are not searching for any political topics or news-related things. With that, it means that advertisers have a lower &#8220;reputation risk&#8221; that may occur from a social media company being caught up in a political or social debate.</p><p>The things that are most searched on Pinterest are related to furnishing, home d&#233;cor, jewelry, cooking, etc. </p><ol start="3"><li><p><strong>Users</strong></p></li></ol><p><strong>3.1. Demographic</strong></p><p>An important thing to analyze with Pinterest is its user demographics. Pinterest has done a great job capturing the population that is most receptive to shopping and has the household buying decision:</p><p>&#8211; 71 % of Pinterest users are women. Pinterest captures 83 % of all US women between the ages of 25 &#8211; 54. </p><p>But the users are not only women:</p><p>&#8211; 40 % of US dads use Pinterest for searching, shopping, and planning for fatherhood.</p><p>Dads normally search for DIY projects they can do with their kids and look for ideas on how to prepare healthy meals and stuff like that.</p><p>We have to acknowledge that this is probably the &#8220;prime audience&#8221; to capture as a social media company. Young women are the ones that make 80 % of buying decisions in the US household. On the other hand, we all know that people with children are in the period of their life where they spend most on things that children need, buying a new car, buying a new home, etc. These are statistically the ages where most people make their biggest lifetime spending decisions.

That means that because of the way they use Pinterest, these users don&#8217;t mind ads; in fact, if they are relevant, they even like them.

This resulted in a 35% revenue growth for Q1 and 4% revenue growth for Q2. But as advertisers got rid of fears of an economic catastrophe and saw COVID as the new normal, they continued their marketing spending and even increased their budgets as doing business online is almost the only way you can do business nowadays. This resulted in a huge revenue increase of 58% in Q3. Now Pinterest&#8217;s most important quarter of the year is the fourth quarter. Pinterest will report Q4 results on the 4th of February after the market close. </p><p>Pinterest guided for Q4 revenue growth on the last earnings call to be at 60%:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Our current expectation is that Q4 revenue will grow around 60% year over year, a modest acceleration compared to our growth rate in Q320. We continue to navigate uncertainty given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and other factors.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>If they hit their guidance, Pinterest will close the 2020 year with approx. $1.6B in annual revenue.</p><p>Also, when looking at the balance sheet, we can see that Pinterest has built a nice war chest of cash as they have around $2B in current assets and $0.36B in total liabilities. This can further provide them the ability to invest in bringing new features to the platform as well as fueling growth and possibilities on the M&amp;A side.</p><p><strong>4.1.

But looking at the user growth of international users, we see that this is the fastest-growing segment.</p><p>Management also acknowledges that the biggest opportunity in terms of monetization is in the international base:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;U.S. ARPU was $3.85, an increase of 31% year over year. International ARPU was $0.21, an increase of 66% year over year. International ARPU remains in the early stages, as we have only begun to execute on our strategy to provide ads that are useful and inspiring to our users in regions outside of the U.S.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Another big factor to better monetization should also be the fairly newly introduced auto bidding option.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Automatic bidding for conversion objectives launched at the beginning of July and in Q3 represented more than half of conversion revenue, and automatic bidding for shopping ads launched in September. In addition to spending their existing budgets more efficiently, the majority of early adopters of oCPM automatic bidding have increased their budgets on Pinterest&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Having an effective platform for advertisers in the monetization phase of the business is key, as we learned from the Facebook playbook. Although Pinterest is still early in this regard, its focuses can lie elsewhere for the time being.</p><ol start="5"><li><p><strong>Social commerce </strong></p></li></ol><p>Social commerce is the biggest opportunity, in my opinion, for Pinterest. In essence, social commerce means that the user is on social media the whole cycle of the shopping experience. So from the discovery phase to the end, buy and enter your shipping details phase. It is very popular in China, and the East as companies like Pinduoduo in China and Shopee from Sea limited have built great businesses around it.</p><p>On the West, really the main two &#8220;assets&#8221; for building a social commerce experience are Pinterest and Instagram. And as we saw from the user behavior numbers, Pinterest&#8217;s platform is made for this.</p><p>Social commerce is one of the areas Pinterest has been focusing on a lot, and rightfully so. The first step was introducing the Buyable Pins, now partnering with companies like Shopify. All of these things add to the shopping experience of the users. And obviously, the users are behaving well to these new Shopping features, as we can see from the earnings call:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;We also launched new product pin detail pages that include alternative images, shipping information, sale pricing, and more. In addition, we recently announced a new suite of merchant tools including an updated merchant storefront profile, testing for product tags and a more intuitive catalog feed ingestion tool. These efforts, along with the features we&#8217;ve launched over the past several quarters are making a difference; the number of Pinners engaging with shopping surfaces has grown over 85% in the six months ended September 30.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>With Social commerce features, Pinterest can expand its revenue from ads. And the technology that will be essential for the coming future in this field is AR and holograms. Both Facebook, as well as Pinterest are going in this direction. As shopping will mean that you will be able to project new makeup on your face and see how it looks, or clothes and also being able to put holograms of furniture into your house and see how these elements would look in your environment. We can see Pinterest&#8217;s start in this field with its latest AR-powered try-on experience for eyeshadow.

It is really doing all the right things with the trends that are going on in the e-commerce and social commerce field. They also announced a partnership with Zoom for Pinterest online classes.</p><ol start="6"><li><p><strong>Valuation</strong></p></li></ol><p>So from a valuation standpoint, I started my Pinterest position back when it was in the $20 range and since added on almost every bigger pullback.

Teenagers don&#8217;t have as much buying power and are less likely to buy products of bigger value. While platforms like to see teenagers using them and believing this will continue when they grow up, I don&#8217;t buy this theme completely. In a phase where you are a teenager, you are developing and changing habits very fast, so I don&#8217;t believe there is that high of a chance that you will stick to a platform that you used for sending memes and jokes to your highschool friends for buying your furniture when you buy a house.</p><p>We also need to take into account the growth of this user base. From all the mentioned companies, Pinterest is the only growing user base in the 30-40% range. For comparison, Snapchat&#8217;s recent user growth was at 18%.</p><p>My fair value for PINS, given all the above, would be to value a PINS user somewhere between a value of a Facebook user and a Snapchat user. That would mean between $137-$216 per user. &nbsp;</p><p>That would translate into a PINS market cap of $60B- $95B. Given PINS market cap is now $45B, it is obvious I see the stock going much higher in the mid to long term horizon.</p><ol start="7"><li><p><strong>Summary</strong></p></li></ol><p>PINS is one of the most important companies in my portfolio, and I believe it will continue to be in the future. It is performing great in terms of growth; it has big potential in the social commerce segment and looking at a more long-term picture, it is one of the most important assets for e-commerce companies that will compete against Facebook in the future. By that, I mean companies like Etsy and even Amazon. When social commerce takes off, these e-commerce companies will have to look to participate in PINS either via a partnership or even M&amp;A, as building out a big social media company is one of the hardest things to do, even if you have deep pockets. Pinterest already accounts for 40% of Etsy&#8217;s social traffic.</p><p>Copying a platform like Pinterest is not that easy as Facebook already tried with their project called Hobbi (more about it here <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/facebook-shuts-down-hobbi-its-experimental-app-for-documenting-personal-projects/">https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/facebook-shuts-down-hobbi-its-experimental-app-for-documenting-personal-projects/</a>), which they shut down.</p><p>I am staying long the company, and as long as I see user growth, albeit even at a slower pace than in 2020, it is enhancing my conviction in the stock. In social media, if you have the users and they keep coming, the advertisers will naturally follow.</p><p>If you liked this analysis and are interested in others, please subscribe to this newsletter; it is free.

And we can see that it is still growing, although be it at a small percent (because of the sheer size). It is important not to be blindsided because you may represent a younger population that nobody is using it. Again 1.8 billion people use it daily, and these are people that still hold much of the buying power.&nbsp;</p><p>And this huge user base is currently being monetized by one source, and that is advertising. Facebook as a company made $70.7B in revenue in the year 2019, although Facebook doesn&#8217;t break the revenue from the &#8220;blue&#8221; part and Instagram, there are estimates that out of that the &#8220;blue&#8221; part generated $50B. Looking at the numbers, the Gross Margin is more than impressive. Even at this scale, it stands at 82%. So this is one of the most profitable businesses in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Now the &#8220;blue&#8221; part of Facebook serves for two important things, in my opinion. One is it is the &#8220;cash cow.&#8221; It generates huge amounts of cash that can fuel other parts of the company. The other one is its huge user base can provide a great source of upselling other services besides advertising.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I like to invest in companies with big user bases because doing an upsell to your existing client base is much easier than going &#8220;on the market&#8221; and paying to acquire new customers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Instagram</strong></p><p>Instagram is the more &#8220;cool&#8221; part of Facebook. Facebook acquired Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion. When FB bought Instagram, Instagram had roughly 50 million users. In 2020 this figure is said to be around 1 billion. Back then, it also didn&#8217;t generate any revenue. In 2019 it was rumored that Instagram generated around $20 billion in annual revenue.&nbsp;</p><p>The main thing about Instagram is the potential it has in social commerce. </p><p>Social commerce is a concept that is very popular in the East with Pinduoduo, Alibaba, and others in China, Sea Limited in South East Asia, and others. Social commerce means that the user of social media makes an e-commerce purchase inside the social media app. So this is a more interactive and personalized experience of e-commerce. I believe social commerce is already and will be even more important in the West in the following years.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two key &#8220;social assets&#8221; in the West that can currently offer a perfect social commerce experience. One is Pinterest, and the other one is Instagram.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Instagram is built so that the visual presentation and visual elements are more important than the text and words. It is also the most important &#8220;home&#8221; of social influencers. Social influencers, either big ones or even micro-influencers, are a trend that is driving a lot of sales in the e-commerce and marketing space.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It is key for Facebook to make sure that Instagram stays &#8220;cool&#8221; and keeps the market leader position in the influencer category. This is what keeps the users on the platform and drives new ones.</p><p>Instagram is a platform that needs to focus mostly on user growth and user retention. Simultaneously, &#8220;blue facebook&#8221; can be more orientated towards businesses (so the customers that pay for ads and e-commerce features). That is why Instagram also needs to keep up with the competition on the feature front, be it with the Story feature (first introduced by Snapchat) or Reels (first introduced by TikTok).&nbsp;</p><p>Instagram is Facebooks&#8217; crown jewel on the social commerce part. At some point, I believe it will generate more revenue from commerce features that advertising.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WhatsApp</strong></p><p>Another important acquisition company of FB is WhatsApp. Facebook acquired the company back in 2014, which was then an eye-popping $19 billion valuation. One of the first things FB did was get rid of its annual subscription fee of&nbsp; $1 and made the app free. The app has surged in popularity, especially in emerging markets like India. WhatsApp has around 2 billion users now and is an essential part of the FB portfolio.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>WhatsApp was able to be free and unmonetized all this time because it was &#8220;fueled&#8221; by the cash cow of FB&#8217;s other operations. FB recently announced goals to start monetizing WhatsApp, although the strategy, in my view, will be different from the classical advertising business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>WhatsApp has the ability to become one of the key fintech and e-commerce apps (similar to WeChat from Tencent in China). When the cryptocurrency backed by the association of companies, including Facebook, launches Diem (the cryptocurrency), WhatsApp could serve as the main front window to the cryptocurrency wallet Facebooks wants to launch called Novi, which will be able to hold Diems. Also, WhatsApp is providing a key bring between businesses and clients in terms of communication. FB is now rolling more and more features that are orientated to help businesses attract WhatsApp users and sell them products through the chat. We can see that FB is going in the direction that Square has gone with its ecosystem &#8211; connecting their sellers who use Square with CashApp users. I think FB is going in similar directions. The latest acquisition of CRM startup Kustomer (for $1 billion) is a sign of this. Kustomer will provide the businesses that use WhatsApp, features for better managing potential clients (WhatsApp users).&nbsp;</p><p>WhatsApp recently announced new privacy changes, which mean more information sharing with its mother company Facebook. But there are no changes to end-to-end encryption, although many people on social media have been claiming this. We also saw many people calling this the end of WhatsApp and going to platforms such as Signal and Telegram. But the fact seems not to tell this story.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Adam Blacker, vice president of insights at Apptopia, despite the surge in Signal and Telegram downloads, WhatsApp has not seen a decline.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too ingrained. My guess is there is a very small number of people who use WhatsApp daily that are recently deleting it,&#8221; Blacker told CNBC by email. &#8220;Even those who are downloading and using Signal or Telegram will continue to use WhatsApp as that is where most of their friends and family are. They may start to talk to certain people on Signal but still chat with their mom on WhatsApp.&#8221;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><strong>Facebook Reality Labs</strong></p><p>Not many people know this segment of Facebook&#8217;s operation. But this is one of the key business segments for Facebook&#8217;s long-term growth.&nbsp;</p><p>Facebook Reality Labs is a business segment where FB develops VR and AI solutions. These range from software things to hardware (Oculus and AR glasses).&nbsp;</p><p>FB is investing heavily in this business segment, as Zuckerberg believes that AR/VR is the next &#8220;platform&#8221; similar to smartphones. I share his belief that especially AR, has the potential to become the next big platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To understand the magnitude of this segment, we need to understand where, despite being extremely powerful and strong, FB lacks others. It does not control the hardware and, with that, has the whole ecosystem. One of the main things FB has trouble with is that it does not own the operating system and app store. So it is as every other developer company out there depended on the Apple and Google ecosystem. That brings a problem for FB as both Apple and Google can dictate policy changes, in-app-purchase fees, etc. Zuckerberg knows this, so he wants to be prepared when the next platform becomes mainstream to own the whole ecosystem and not be dependent on other companies.&nbsp;</p><p>So in this segment, there are two important things: VR (Virtual Reality) and the other one is AR (Augmented Reality). To put it as simple as possible, VR means that you enter a complete virtual world (virtual environment). AR means that the environment is the same as the real one but that things are projected into your environment (through holograms).&nbsp;</p><p>This is really life-changing technology, and if you are interested more in how Zuck sees it, this is a good video to start:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAagtcAup0o&amp;t=496s">Talking Tech and Holograms with Mark Zuckerberg!</a></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ff512e2-d16d-4a6d-9c47-cc83d5d08e3e_480x360.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ff512e2-d16d-4a6d-9c47-cc83d5d08e3e_480x360.jpeg" width="480" height="360" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2ff512e2-d16d-4a6d-9c47-cc83d5d08e3e_480x360.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:360,&quot;width&quot;:480,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ff512e2-d16d-4a6d-9c47-cc83d5d08e3e_480x360.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ff512e2-d16d-4a6d-9c47-cc83d5d08e3e_480x360.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ff512e2-d16d-4a6d-9c47-cc83d5d08e3e_480x360.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ff512e2-d16d-4a6d-9c47-cc83d5d08e3e_480x360.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>FB shows a high understanding of how&nbsp;AR and VR can become the next platform.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of VR, they sell their Oculus VR headsets. They recently reduced the price of their new set to under $300, making it very affordable. Zuckerberg talked on many occasions that their goal is to get 10 million people active on this &#8220;platform.&#8221; This is what they calculated as the critical mass for the product to go mainstream. The key thing is that with an ecosystem of 10 million users, developers start to enter a platform and produce features, content, etc. This is because developers need to see enough mass in users to make features that people will pay for and make a business out of it. FB already has developers working on their platform, but so far, they are mostly being &#8220;financed&#8221; by FB.&nbsp;</p><p>And then there is the AR segment, which, in my view, has even more potential to become the next platform. Here they are developing AR glasses. They are very strict on what for them the product should look like. The glasses should be as slick as possible and resemble ordinary glasses or sunglasses (with a thicker side). A key decision here is when they partnered with Luxottica, which is set to start in 2021. Luxottica is the leading manufacturer of glasses and sunglass. From Ray-Ban, Prada, Versace, and more. So this means that FB knows that for people to use AR, the glasses need to look like ordinary glasses we wear now and be cool. Nobody wants to look odd when walking down the street.&nbsp;</p><p>But these &#8220;moonshot&#8221; projects, if you will, are not that far away from reality. In fact, if you look at the last four quarters of FB&#8217;s Other Revenue segment, which is mostly Reality Lab, it makes $1.2B in revenue on an annual basis. The YoY growth of this segment is also high in the 40%-60% range. So if this was a stand-alone company, the valuation of this wouldn&#8217;t be small for sure.&nbsp;</p><p>On the flip side, everything that FB is developing in this segment, in terms of holograms and visual tech, can also be used on their social media assets like Instagram (which is more visual-based). So the R&amp;D FB is paying will not reap the results only when AR/VR becomes mainstream but will also provide competitive advantages in a short time frame to assets like Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Financials</strong></p><p>Ok, let&#8217;s look at FB&#8217;s financials.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08959e8c-c2ec-4942-99b2-21627eb6f422_920x438.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08959e8c-c2ec-4942-99b2-21627eb6f422_920x438.png" width="920" height="438" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/08959e8c-c2ec-4942-99b2-21627eb6f422_920x438.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:438,&quot;width&quot;:920,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08959e8c-c2ec-4942-99b2-21627eb6f422_920x438.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08959e8c-c2ec-4942-99b2-21627eb6f422_920x438.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08959e8c-c2ec-4942-99b2-21627eb6f422_920x438.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08959e8c-c2ec-4942-99b2-21627eb6f422_920x438.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Source: yahoo finance&nbsp;</p><p>We can see that before COVID, the revenue growth was 37% in 2018 and 26% in 2019. This year because of COVID affecting many small-medium businesses, advertising growth will be in the mid to low teens. Nonetheless, even in advertising, FB has been gaining market share in the last years.&nbsp;</p><p>What is even more impressive is the Gross Margin that is constantly over 80%, which shows just how profitable this business is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>One important thing to notice is also Operating Expenses. They have been rising fast, especially in the last 3 years. The main reason for higher Operating expense costs is administrative costs related to content moderation. So the push to moderating and removing inappropriate content has affected FB&#8217;s business in the last years, and this trend will probably continue. Although FB wasn&#8217;t that prepared for this a few years ago, they have probably invested a lot into R&amp;D in terms of software on this segment to reduce the human labor costs associated with this.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Main challenges</strong></p><p>The main short to mid-term challenges FB is facing today are, in my opinion, the following:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Possibility of regulators to push for a company break up&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>iOS new privacy tracking update&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Repeal of Section 230&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Now while I won&#8217;t give you a deep dive on my thought process for each of these challenges, I will give you my end conclusions on them.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Possibility of a regulatory push for a company break up</strong></p><p>I find the possibility of this happening low. </p><p>The main reason:</p><ul><li><p>Questionable political support to go all the way&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Legal challenges for the government to build a strong case&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>FB will fight it hard&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The US is in a tech war with China and crippling your main players is not a good strategy&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>While each of these points has the potential for a new post, I will leave it at that. </p><p>Even if, in some scenario, the break-up would happen, I believe current FB shareholders would get more value than what the FB&#8217;s market share is currently reflecting (look at the Valuation part).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>iOS new privacy tracking update</strong></p><p>Apple introduces its plan for a big privacy change in which users will be asked if they allow a certain application to track them while they are not using this application. So this means that now, for example, FB could see what other apps users have installed and, for example, what sites the users visited, etc. There was the optionality for an iOS user to turn this off, but it required the user to go into Settings. Now a pop-up will appear once you start using an app. FB acknowledges that this change will have a material effect on their clients. So this is a challenge as many users could choose the &#8220;not allow&#8221; button, and with that, FB will have less information about the users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This is not a problem that is FB specific. With that, I mean, is that the whole sector will have the same challenge. In general, online advertising will become less effective for advertisers as advertising platforms will have less information resulting in less effective targeting.&nbsp;</p><p>With this change, I don&#8217;t think it will much affect FB&#8217;s business as advertisers will have the same challenge on every platform they go to. So the end result could be lower efficiency of advertising campaigns, but the market positioning in the industry should not change. In a sense, FB may even get more advertisers as data they gather in their internal ecosystem may become even more valuable.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Repeal of Section 230</strong></p><p>So Section 230 is legislation that basically provides immunity for website publishers from third-party content. So in a sense, it protects platforms from being legally responsible for the content that their users publish (there are some exceptions).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There was a political push to change this right before and after the recent US elections. This push may continue going forward and present a challenge that platforms might have to address.&nbsp;</p><p>Mark addressed this challenge in the recent earnings call:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;So at this point, we have the benefit of seeing how different countries have adopted different types of regulation and getting to understand how that either makes the problems more effective for dealing with them or, in some cases, makes it harder and actually creates worse results. So the approaches that I think seem to have worked best by looking at what France and a few other countries have done is basically one which focuses on creating a transparent process where companies have to report how they're doing moderation, reporting on how much harmful content of different categories is visible, the portion of the content on the service, and what percent of it our content moderation systems can get to before people need to report it to us. And I think a system like that, which basically requires companies to meet certain thresholds or show improvement, aligns incentives in the right way to encourage companies to minimize the amount of that harmful content that people are seeing. But there are plenty of examples where there are other regulatory regimes that I think point towards -- that are counterproductive, right? Or basically require companies to do things that aren't quite getting at the most important aspect of the problem. For example, in some countries, there are rules saying you have to get to certain content within a short period of time. And that, I think, is good on its face, but I think the reality is that a piece of content that's going not to be seen by many people, maybe it's not as urgent to deal with as one that is going to be problematic but is going to be seen by a lot of people. You really want to get to that sooner. So treating all content equally compared to just looking at the prevalence of how much bad stuff people see I think is going to be less effective overall.&#8221;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>FB is, in my opinion, one of the most prepared companies for this kind of change. It also has the most resources to comply with it, and again this change would affect the whole industry. In the end result, I think this might even help FB as competitors will have higher entry barriers and will have to spend a lot of resources and cash to have departments that will moderate content and keep it in line with the possible new legislation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Main opportunities</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Diem and cryptocurrency</strong></p></li></ol><p>Facebook has started an association to form a cryptocurrency. Now this project was first named Libra, later changed to Diem. The purpose of the association is to form a network of partners who will support the cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency is proposed to be a stable coin backed by the USD (although there were plans for it to be backed by different fiat currencies). The partners in the association are powerful, reputable companies. To name a few: Uber, Lyft, Shopify, Spotify, PayU, Coinbase.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So while FB will not own the currency, their company Novi will launch a Wallet that will hold the cryptocurrency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Now make no mistake; this is a huge thing for FB. If they apply the wallet through all of their assets (Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, etc.), they leverage their huge user base and make it for people to have an easy way to buy things, send P2P money, etc. They basically make CashApp but with a currency (Diem) that means fewer transaction costs and no more credit card fees. With their partner network, this is even a bigger deal.&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine ordering an Uber and just paying through Messenger or WhatsApp. This would present a real disruption to the whole FinTech world, as FB has the biggest user base out there. And people will adopt it because all of their friends will have it from day one (because they use one of FB&#8217;s assets), and it will be the easiest way to transfer money.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, for developing countries with high inflation, this is a game-changer. People will be able to transfer their local currency to Diem (which is stable in price because it is USD backed) and not worry about the bankruptcy of local banks or local currency inflation.&nbsp;</p><p>Now Diem faces and still will face a lot of pressure from governments worldwide, as many see it as a threat to their financial system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ol start="2"><li><p><strong>AR/VR</strong></p></li></ol><p>The AR and VR segment is one of the biggest opportunities for FB as it is the biggest investor in the world in terms of AR/VR. If this becomes the next platform, FB has good chances to become the leader in this space.&nbsp;</p><ol start="3"><li><p><strong>Social commerce</strong></p></li></ol><p>We already discussed the capabilities of FB to be able to leverage their assets and build a unique commerce experience. I believe FB is in the early stages of this social commerce adoption and will be a completely different company in the next 5 years. I expect a big portfolio of the revenue to come from none ad-related segments like Social Commerce.&nbsp;</p><ol start="4"><li><p><strong>Zuckerberg</strong></p></li></ol><p>While some dislike him, you have to give him the credit he deserves. He is one of the youngest &#8220;big tech&#8221; founders of the decade and is exceptional in execution. The acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp are one of the greatest acquisitions of all time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>He knows how to protect&nbsp;FB shareholders&nbsp;from competitive threats. This is either via M&amp;A either via copying features from other platforms; thus, he keeps the FB family of products always competitive. We know what happened to MySpace and FB with Zuck in charge seems like a completely different story.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Valuation</strong></p><p>Ok, so from a valuation standpoint, the stock is currently trading $251.36 or, to put it in market cap at approx $ 716 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, if we try to evaluate FB&#8217;s business segments:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>&#8220;blue&#8221; Facebook &#8211; in 2019, Instagram is rumored to have produced $20B revenue, so the &#8220;blue&#8221; FB made around $50B in revenue. In the last 3 years, FB&#8217;s pre-tax net margin has been around 50%-30%. If we take 35%, which was the latest info, because of higher costs (mostly related to content moderating), that means that the &#8220;blue&#8221; business segment is netting pre-tax&nbsp;$17.5B in profit. Now since this is a mature business, a P/E multiple of 20 would be appropriate. This would value &#8220;blue&#8221; FB at $350B.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Instagram. Instagram has said to produce $20B in revenue in 2019. It has also been consistently growing more than 30% on the top line. Considering the growth and the high gross margin business, a 15x Sales multiple seems&nbsp;reasonable. This would value Instagram at $300B.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>WhatsApp. So WhatsApp is a part of FB that is not yet monetized. But what we do know is that they have around 2 billion users. So let&#8217;s try to evaluate it based on the user base. It is really popular in the Asia Pacific and the Rest of the World, although many users are also in the US and EU. If we look at the ARPU breakdown of Facebook, we can see that they are monetizing the Asia Pacific users annually at $13.29 (data for last four quarters) and the Rest of the World ARPU at $8.47.&nbsp; If we average this number, we get to ARPU of $10.88. If we apply this ARPU to the user base, we get a potential annual revenue from WhatsApp at $21.76 billion. And let&#8217;s keep in mind we applied the monetization revenue of advertising, so we are not even thinking about other ways that WhatsApp can generate revenue. If we apply just a 10x Sales multiple to this business, we get a $217B value of WhatsApp.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Facebook Reality Labs. Now, this business is the one that is probably the hardest to evaluate. It has the potential to become the next &#8220;platform&#8221; but at the same time is a big cash burner in terms of R&amp;D. What we do know about it is that the segment currently brings in approx $1.2B in revenue (data based on last four quarters) and that it is growing over 40% YoY. We also know that this is a mix of hardware and software, similar to a company like Apple. In current market conditions and because of its potential and growth, a 30x Sales multiple seems like a good start. That would value the Facebook Reality Labs business at $36B.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Now, if we add all the business values together, we get to $903B in value.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Now we must also take into account FB&#8217;s cash pile. If we take FB&#8217;s current assets and deduct all the liabilities, we get extra cash of $34B.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So together, my fair value of FB is $937B. The market cap is $716B. So in my view, FB has a 30% upside to reach a fair market value. But keep in mind that I valued FB&#8217;s businesses purely on advertising and didn&#8217;t even account for its potential to upsell other services like commerce features, payment, etc.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>I recently added to my FB position as I believe the company is undervalued because of all the negative news. FB is one of the most profitable companies and is, in my view, a pure growth company. It is one of my core portfolio positions in the long run, and even in the short term, I believe there could be a big revaluation happening when they launch Diem.&nbsp;</p><p>If you liked this analysis and are interested in others, please subscribe to this newsletter.

They guided revenue for fiscal 2021 to be in the range of &#163;170 million - &#163;180 million. That represents a top-line growth of 20%-27%.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So,&nbsp;the guidance at first glance seems like a low number, but I see reasons for it.&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p><strong>First of all, COVID is a big headwind for the whole RPA industry.</strong></p></li></ol><p>&nbsp;As Blue Prism noted:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;During the year the Group noted a direct impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, with customers responding to the uncertain macro environment by delaying purchasing decisions or reducing deal sizes. The Group saw some recovery in the second half of the year, with sales activity improving and deal sizes starting to recover, but overall deal sizes remained lower than the prior year.&#8221;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>So&nbsp;the pandemic has a negative effect on the growth of the RPA industry, not like many other software industries where the pandemic&nbsp;actually&nbsp;accelerated some growth drivers.&nbsp;</p><ol start="2"><li><p><strong>Blue Prism fiscal year is not the same as the end of the calendar year</strong></p></li></ol><p>Blue Prism&#8217;s fiscal year ends at the end of October, and a&nbsp;new fiscal year&nbsp;start in November. With that in mind, we have to understand that the guidance that they provided was given for the period of 31. October 2020 &#8211;31. October 2021. And if we look at this period, we can see that probably 3 quarters out of 4 will still be affected by the pandemic (as vaccinations have just started to roll in countries). On the contrary, in fiscal 2020, they &#8220;only&#8221; had 2 quarters that affected their results.&nbsp;So,&nbsp;more COVID means more risk for the business.&nbsp;</p><ol start="3"><li><p><strong>There are no signs of the business&nbsp;losing&nbsp;market share.</strong></p></li></ol><p>The guidance in my opinion&nbsp;reflects&nbsp;the risks to the whole industry because of COVID and not because Blue Prism would be&nbsp;losing&nbsp;market share to other competitors.&nbsp;</p><p>In&nbsp;fact,&nbsp;in this report, there are four things that stand out to me in regards to market positioning.&nbsp;</p><p>First is the retention rate:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Despite the pandemic driving significant uncertainty for the customer base, overall customer retention remained very strong. The gross retention rate for the year was 98%, with very low levels of revenue churn. The majority of losses were very small in size - 103, or 88% of the losses related to customers with deployments of 5 or less digital workers.&#8221;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>So, we can see that they maintained a high gross&nbsp;retention&nbsp;rate of 98% and also that 88% of the losses related to customers were with clients that had 5 or less digital works (digital workers in this sense can be view as &#8220;seats&#8221; or users.&#8221;&nbsp;So,&nbsp;the clients that were leaving were mostly small clients (which are probably more affected by the pandemic).&nbsp;</p><p>Second is the remark on the market share of the cloud business:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;147% increase in Blue Prism Cloud bookings, the market leader with 20% share of the RPA SaaS market (based on IDC market sizing)&#8221;.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The Blue Prism Cloud was&nbsp;actually&nbsp;the market leader with a 20% share of the RPA SaaS market, which considering the competitiveness of the market, is far from a small number.&nbsp;</p><p>Thirdly the&nbsp;pipeline&nbsp;remains very strong:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Significant long-term commitments made - remaining performance obligation, which represents future revenues under contract but not yet&nbsp;recognised&nbsp;as revenue, was &#163;312m&#8221;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>And&nbsp;fourthly,&nbsp;the developers/partners are joining and not leaving:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Online marketplace 'Blue Prism Digital Exchange' leverages 100 technology partnerships, now has 46,000 users, a 318% increase from 2019, and 1,800 assets&#8221;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Whenever a platform is gaining developers and Blue Prism had a 318% increase, that is a bullish sign and not a bearish.

This makes me believe that the company knows its position and has the vision to develop its product and services and continue to catch market share and expand its product offering.&nbsp;</p><p>In the report, Blue Prism noted:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;In response to uncertainty driven by the COVID-19 pandemic the Group raised &#163;100m (before expenses) to reinforce the balance sheet in the event of prolonged market disruptions. This funding allowed the Group to maintain investments made during 2018 and 2019 while continuing to&nbsp;prioritise&nbsp;spending into product and R&amp;D, positioning the Group&nbsp;favourably&nbsp;as normal market conditions return.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>They also increased their R&amp;D spend by 124%.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As already&nbsp;said,&nbsp;I like to see companies in high growth industry spending on R&amp;D as this normally converts into higher growth down the line.&nbsp;</p><ol start="5"><li><p><strong>The US listing is still in play.</strong></p></li></ol><p>The company said in November it was thinking about a secondary listing in the US. In this report, they noted that that is still in process and no decision was made yet. I find that the US listing would be&nbsp;extremely&nbsp;bullish for the stock as the valuation is, in my view, given the current market conditions very low. With the recent fall, the stock is trading at a 7.6x forward Sales multiple (given the 20-27% rev guidance estimate). Even if the results are indeed what the company guided 20-27% revenue growth with a growing industry like RPA with a high margin should not be trading at such a low multiple given current market conditions. Just for comparison, Alteryx, listed in the US with a similar growth rate in the mid-20s, is trading at a 16x Sales multiple.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Summary </strong></p><p>I find the earnings results good. There were a lot of things I liked. I was quite shocked when I saw the market reaction when the stock fell -25%.&nbsp; I used the opportunity to add to the position. The stock since then recovered and closed the trading on the London stock exchange with &#8211;19%. I remain&nbsp;bullish&nbsp;on the stock. </p><p>The full report you can find here:&nbsp;https://www.investegate.co.uk/blue-prism-group-plc/rns/preliminary-results-for-year-ended-31-oct-2020/202101140700076308L/?fbclid=IwAR0HujlyeWNKelgHmOwrHXNb8rvDcYBEuGLdhBEDs4Ugurfy_wOsOsvN75Q&nbsp;</p><p>Disclaimer:&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing contained in this website and newsletter should be understood as&nbsp;investment or financial advice.

They are adding new features fast, and this part of their business is a very new business line. They launched&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;money and&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;invest in January 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The third pillar of their business is the Technology platform business. In April 2020,&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;bought an API infrastructure provider for financial services called Galileo.&nbsp;Galileo&nbsp;offers fintech companies and neo-banks APIs that provide them&nbsp;infrastructure&nbsp;services for payment, investing, etc.&nbsp;Some clients&nbsp;are well-known fintech companies like Robinhood, Chime, Monzo, Dave,&nbsp;Moneylion, TransferWise...&nbsp;</p><p>Before 2019,&nbsp;SoFi,&nbsp;with only its lending business,&nbsp;would not&nbsp;catch my eye. The more interesting segment for me is their Financial Service segment and Technology platform segment.&nbsp;</p><p>Before we dive into the segments, it is important to note&nbsp;also the management.&nbsp;</p><p>SoFi&nbsp;had a sexual&nbsp;harassment&nbsp;scandal in 2017. With that, there was a huge management shake out, and also the CEO left. This was probably one of the&nbsp;darkest&nbsp;periods for&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;as they were even thinking of selling the company, but according to reports, could not get the price they wanted. In February 2018,&nbsp;famous CEO Anthony Noto joined the company, and we can now say that if before the management was a problem, now it is a&nbsp;big competitive&nbsp;advantage. Here is the management &#8220;superstar&#8221;&nbsp;line up:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef4d668b-0ab6-495f-b392-ee4f1fedfc44_1024x495.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef4d668b-0ab6-495f-b392-ee4f1fedfc44_1024x495.png" width="1024" height="495" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ef4d668b-0ab6-495f-b392-ee4f1fedfc44_1024x495.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:495,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef4d668b-0ab6-495f-b392-ee4f1fedfc44_1024x495.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef4d668b-0ab6-495f-b392-ee4f1fedfc44_1024x495.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef4d668b-0ab6-495f-b392-ee4f1fedfc44_1024x495.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef4d668b-0ab6-495f-b392-ee4f1fedfc44_1024x495.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>It is important to understand that&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;before 2018 was a totally different company. We could say that even before 2019, when&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;launched&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;money and&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;invest the company was a totally different company. Before 2019 the company had only 1 out of the 3 business segments that&nbsp;they have today.&nbsp;The last 2 years have been&nbsp;revolutionary&nbsp;for the company.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The&nbsp;lending&nbsp;business</strong></p><p>I won&#8217;t focus too much attention on the lending business as it is one of the least interesting segments to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;lending&nbsp;business is a mature business for&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;as they have been offering loans for years. Where they differ from other lending providers is that besides the common financial information needed for credit approval, they also take into account the &#8220;soft data&#8221;&nbsp;and, based on that, offer you a&nbsp;competitive&nbsp;rate.&nbsp;In 2019 they had $443 million in revenue from the lending business, and in 2020 they estimate this to be around $514 million. They also provide a number of the gross margin of this business, which is 58%. They estimate that for the next 5 years, the Lending business will result in a 25% CAGR.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at the big picture, the thing that is important to note is that because of their system and the financial service segment, they have lower client&nbsp;acquisition&nbsp;costs as there are many synergies between these two segments. This, together with the lower headcount and costs (compared to a traditional bank), makes their lending business more profitable.&nbsp;</p><p>I also view the Lending business as a good offering for the Financial service business part as they are one of the rare Financial service apps that also offer loans (the bigger ones like mortgage&nbsp;etc.)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Financial service segment</strong></p><p>The financial service segment is basically the&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;app.&nbsp;So,&nbsp;what does the &#8220;SoFi&nbsp;app&#8221; consist of. You have the option to deposit funds and earn interest, and you can invest in stocks,&nbsp;cryptocurrencies,&nbsp;ETF, etc.&nbsp; You can&nbsp;also&nbsp;have a credit card. There is&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;Protect, which means you can get&nbsp;insurance&nbsp;products such as&nbsp;life insurance,&nbsp;auto insurance,&nbsp;home, and rental&nbsp;insurance.&nbsp;Then there is also&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;Relay, which&nbsp;allows&nbsp;you to have an&nbsp;overview&nbsp;of your spending and calculate your own credit&nbsp;score.&nbsp;Of course,&nbsp;since this is&nbsp;SoFi,&nbsp;you can also get a loan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>SoFi&nbsp;also has a business offering in&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;Work, which offers businesses&nbsp;financial aid and service for their employees&nbsp;as well&nbsp;as services designed for business financing&nbsp;through&nbsp;Lantern.&nbsp;Lantern can help with services like invoice financing, line of credit, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>SoFi&#8217;s&nbsp;financial service segment is very similar to the Cash App by Square. In&nbsp;fact,&nbsp;it offers even more as because of&nbsp;SoFi&#8217;s&nbsp;main lending business, you can also get a loan. Square recently started testing loan features on their Cash App as well, but this was so far limited to a small number of customers, and the loans were small in size.&nbsp;</p><p>Now with&nbsp;SoFi&#8217;s&nbsp;financial service segment, you have to keep in mind that this is a very young business. It was launched in January 2019.&nbsp;Here is the timeline of the product:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F796fd7a3-8e8f-4438-807e-e94f3a7876f4_1024x547.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F796fd7a3-8e8f-4438-807e-e94f3a7876f4_1024x547.png" width="1024" height="547" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/796fd7a3-8e8f-4438-807e-e94f3a7876f4_1024x547.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:547,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F796fd7a3-8e8f-4438-807e-e94f3a7876f4_1024x547.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F796fd7a3-8e8f-4438-807e-e94f3a7876f4_1024x547.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F796fd7a3-8e8f-4438-807e-e94f3a7876f4_1024x547.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F796fd7a3-8e8f-4438-807e-e94f3a7876f4_1024x547.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>While this is a young business segment, it is, in my opinion, one of the key segments for&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;going forward.&nbsp;It is obvious also from&nbsp;SoFi&#8217;s&nbsp;investor presentation that they &#8220;bet&#8221; big on this segment:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f690930-d21e-4c1e-bc37-a6c97dc6980c_952x171.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f690930-d21e-4c1e-bc37-a6c97dc6980c_952x171.png" width="952" height="171" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3f690930-d21e-4c1e-bc37-a6c97dc6980c_952x171.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:171,&quot;width&quot;:952,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f690930-d21e-4c1e-bc37-a6c97dc6980c_952x171.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f690930-d21e-4c1e-bc37-a6c97dc6980c_952x171.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f690930-d21e-4c1e-bc37-a6c97dc6980c_952x171.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f690930-d21e-4c1e-bc37-a6c97dc6980c_952x171.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>While Financial Service currently brings almost no revenue,&nbsp;they project the segment to bring in $1.164 billion in revenue in 2025&nbsp;(almost 1/3 of the total revenue)&nbsp;with an average CAGR of 153%.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Technology Platform</strong></p><p>The technology platform represents a recent&nbsp;acquisition&nbsp;of&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;made in April 2020. They bought fintech API provider Galileo for&nbsp;$1.2 billion. With it, they gained a segment that has one of the biggest fintech companies for their customers. The customer list has Robinhood&nbsp;Chime, Monzo, Dave,&nbsp;Moneylion, TransferWise, and many more.&nbsp;Galileo is one of the key API infrastructure providers on the market for fintech and&nbsp;Neobank&nbsp;companies. The main competitors are Plaid and&nbsp;DriveWealth.&nbsp;This market seems to be very interesting for bigger players as Visa acquired plaid in 2020 for $5.3B.&nbsp;Providers of API for banking&nbsp;infrastructure&nbsp;provide fintech companies with the ability to be flexible and fast in development. At the same time, they do not have to make big investments in banking infrastructure and with that, have the risk of&nbsp;constantly&nbsp;developing and keeping the&nbsp;infrastructure&nbsp;up to date. Having outdated backend infrastructure is one of the main problems for traditional banks as they try to compete with fintech companies on user-friendly and&nbsp;flexible&nbsp;frontend apps. They face big issues on the flexibility part with the outdated infrastructure.&nbsp;</p><p>I think the&nbsp;acquisition&nbsp;was timed perfectly&nbsp;for&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;as the market was just waking up from the COVID and lockdown shock in April, and many companies were&nbsp;valued at a discount.&nbsp;The Galileo&nbsp;acquisition&nbsp;seems to be paying off already:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2051c94-8477-4bd2-926b-841615aad921_1024x501.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2051c94-8477-4bd2-926b-841615aad921_1024x501.png" width="1024" height="501" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b2051c94-8477-4bd2-926b-841615aad921_1024x501.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:501,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2051c94-8477-4bd2-926b-841615aad921_1024x501.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2051c94-8477-4bd2-926b-841615aad921_1024x501.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2051c94-8477-4bd2-926b-841615aad921_1024x501.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2051c94-8477-4bd2-926b-841615aad921_1024x501.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>We can see that when&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;bought Galileo, they had 30&nbsp;million&nbsp;in total accounts from their customers, and this figure grew to 50&nbsp;million in&nbsp;Q3 of 2020.&nbsp;The segment is also estimated to bring over $100 million in revenue in 2020. In the future,&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;expects the segment to grow at a 55% CAGR for the next 5 years and have a 62% margin.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Valuating&nbsp;SoFi</strong></p><p>For the valuation part, I decided to evaluate each segment&nbsp;separately&nbsp;as they are quite different businesses but do have some synergies at the end.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Value of the Lending&nbsp;segment</strong></p><p>The lending business is the one that I focused on the least as I think the main&nbsp;advantage&nbsp;of this business is the know-how they build in the loan business, so this can assist their Financial Service segment. Their other competitors, such as Square, are so far behind the curve in the loan business, and having the know-how&nbsp;of this segment may prove valuable for&nbsp;SoFi.&nbsp;<br><br>But if we go to the numbers:&nbsp;</p><p>The Lending business is estimated to bring $514 million in revenue in 2020. Their margin is higher than what is&nbsp;traditionally&nbsp;in this business because of low headcount and infrastructure costs and a&nbsp;referral&nbsp;program and a financial app that makes their CAC low. According to the company data, their margin for the next 5 years should be 58%.&nbsp;They expect a 25% CAGR for the next 5 years.&nbsp;With that in mind, I think applying a 15x Sales multiple given the current market conditions seems&nbsp;reasonable, although there&nbsp;is&nbsp;a risk with the loan business since we do not know how good the quality of these loans&nbsp;is&nbsp;(default risks).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Value of the loan business: $7.7B&nbsp;(given&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;tried to sell itself in 2017 when it only had the Lending business for around $8-$10B but didn&#8217;t get the deal, the value seems&nbsp;reasonable. More on the sale:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5d5c8842-b5f5-11e7-aa26-bb002965bce8">https://www.ft.com/content/5d5c8842-b5f5-11e7-aa26-bb002965bce8</a>)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Value of Financial Service segment</strong></p><p>The financial service business is one of the hardest to estimate. For the valuation, we need&nbsp;to know how many users&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;financial service app has.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The company gives a number&nbsp;of unique members.&nbsp;But this number means customers that borrow on the&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;platform as well as customers of the&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;financial service app.</p><p>Maybe an estimation from app store ratings will give us a better picture.&nbsp;</p><p>To better understand the user base and value, I compared Cash App to&nbsp;the SoFi&nbsp;app.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Here are the numbers&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cash App&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><p>Number of Ratings: 726k&nbsp;</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Star: 4.6&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><strong>SoFi&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><p>Number of Ratings: 56k&nbsp;</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Star: 4.8&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>We know that Cash App has around 30 million MAU, so looking at the ratings,&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;has 7.7% of Cash App ratings. If&nbsp;we&nbsp;applied this rate to the&nbsp;MAU,&nbsp;we would get a number that&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;has 2.3&nbsp;million users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This doesn&#8217;t help us much because they cannot have&nbsp;more than 1.718&nbsp;million users.&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;I will try a different&nbsp;approach. Given current market conditions, Square&#8217;s market cap is around $110B. I calculate that $40B of that is based on their B2B segment, and $70B is the valuation of Cash App ( I can explain this calculation another time ). Cash App&nbsp;Ex&nbsp;Bitcoin revenue will make around $1.5B this year.&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;estimates that its Financial service app segment will generate&nbsp;$1.164B&nbsp;in 2025. If that is the&nbsp;case, then we can say that&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;Financial service will make&nbsp;77% of the revenue Cash App is making now.&nbsp;If we apply the same % to the market cap, that would represent $54B. But we have to discount this&nbsp;to NPV (Net present Value)&nbsp;since this is the value in 2025. For the discount&nbsp;rate, I took&nbsp;40% (since this is&nbsp;what often VCs use, and&nbsp;the SoFi&nbsp;Financial Service segment with almost no revenue&nbsp;currently&nbsp;and&nbsp;being &#8220;open&#8221; for only 2&nbsp;years is similar to a&nbsp;start-up). We get an NPV of&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;Financial Service of&nbsp;$10B.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Value of Technology platform segment</strong></p><p>The Galileo API segment was bought in April 2020 for $1.2B. But since&nbsp;then,&nbsp;we can see that&nbsp;Galileo&nbsp;almost doubled the number of accounts opened for their clients and is estimated to bring $103 million in revenue in 2020.&nbsp;It also has a 62% margin, and&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;estimates a CAGR of 55% for the next 5 years. Since we have many API&nbsp;companies'&nbsp;publicity&nbsp;traded,&nbsp;we can apply&nbsp;a sales multiple. A similar company is Twilio, with a similar 50-60% gross margin.&nbsp;Twilio&#8217;s P/S&nbsp;multiple&nbsp;on 2020 estimated revenue is around 36x. If we apply that to Galileo, the value would be around $3.7B.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Valuation</strong></p><p>When we put together all the segments&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Lending business: $7.7B&nbsp;</p><p>Financial Service: $10B&nbsp;</p><p>Technology Platform: $3.7B&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The joined value stands at $21.4B</strong></p><p>We also forgot to mention that&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;is in the process of obtaining&nbsp;its&nbsp;banking license, which would benefit its Lending business, and&nbsp;also&nbsp;it&#8217;s&nbsp;Financial Service business.&nbsp;</p><p>The company estimates

IPOE's last closing price was $18.74 valuing IPOE public shares and sponsor shares at $1.88B. That implies the valuation of&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;to be at&nbsp;$16.25B (but there are also warrants which may be exercised and are not included in this calculation - 28.1 million public and private placement warrants struck at $11.50).&nbsp;So be careful, there are a lot of warrants issued and they will further dilute IPOE shareholders and lift the market cap.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>I opened a small position in IPOE to get exposure to&nbsp;SoFi. The main reasons are the Financial Service segment and the Technology platform segment. While the Financial Service segment competes with great monster apps like Cash&nbsp;App, the lending know-how could provide&nbsp;the SoFi&nbsp;app with a small advantage&nbsp;until&nbsp;the competitors start figuring out the loan business. The technology platform business is also one of the most interesting businesses for me. However,&nbsp;there&nbsp;is&nbsp;a risk if&nbsp;SoFi direct&nbsp;competitors mind being their client&nbsp;with Galileo and at the same time competitors on the Financial Service segment.&nbsp;</p><p>A big factor in my decision to&nbsp;incite&nbsp;a small position in the company is the superstar management team&nbsp;with CEO Anthony Noto&nbsp;and their decisions. When we look at the last 2 years, the management&nbsp;took what was then a Lending business and grew 2 new segments, which now, for me, represent&nbsp;$13.7B&nbsp;in value. The Galileo acquisition was timed perfectly, and with the SPAC deal,&nbsp;SoFi&nbsp;receives&nbsp;$2.4B in cash to increase their&nbsp;war chest&nbsp;and continue to add value to shareholders.&nbsp;</p><p>Sources:</p><ul><li><p>SoFi Investor presentation</p></li></ul><p>Disclaimer:&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing contained in this website and newsletter should be understood as&nbsp;investment or financial advice.

I am updating you regarding my portfolio and the changes that were made in the last week.&nbsp;</p><p>This week I have added to my positions on two portfolio companies: Alibaba (BABA) and Blue Prism (PRSM).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1st&nbsp;Alibaba&nbsp;(BABA)</strong></p><p>I added to my Alibaba holding as I like the&nbsp;company's long-term&nbsp;story and&nbsp;path and&nbsp;believe&nbsp;recent negative political events are priced in the stock. Investors have been selling this stock in the last weeks violently since the failed IPO of Ant Financial because of&nbsp;regulatory&nbsp;challenges in China.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In essence, I added to the position as I find Alibaba at its current levels a good price point to increase my exposure to this e-commerce, cloud, and fintech giant. I believe Ant Financial will at a later time still do the IPO, and the stock will get positive tailwinds when the news&nbsp;comes in.&nbsp;Also,&nbsp;the growth rate of its e-commerce and cloud business is not slowing down, and they are in a perfect position to continue dominating the Chinese market.

I have owned the stock for quite some time now, and the stock has recently started to price up. The main reason I added to my position is the fact that I like the RPA space for the long run, and I find Blue Prism a good value when looking at their valuation and growth rate. I also picked the time to add to my position this week as their direct competitor UiPath&nbsp;filed for an IPO. I&nbsp;believe&nbsp;there is a bigger chance that the stock in the next weeks can go&nbsp;through&nbsp;a revaluation process and rise in price (because of the UiPath IPO and the analysts that will look into this sector).&nbsp;Although&nbsp;no information is out yet, UiPath is&nbsp;rumored&nbsp;to have somewhere between $400-$500 million ARR while Blue Prism has around $200&nbsp;million. UiPath is believed to price the IPO in the $20 billion range, which would value the company at 40x Sales. Blue Prism is valued at around 10-15x Sales. Even&nbsp;though&nbsp;UiPath is in a stronger position than Blue Prism, I believe the valuation gap should not be that big. A few weeks&nbsp;ago,&nbsp;there was also some news that Blue Prism was considering listing its stock in the US (currently, it&#8217;s in the UK).&nbsp;If PRSM did the US listing, I think the valuation would increase drastically.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Going forward, I will be&nbsp;closely&nbsp;analyzing&nbsp;the UiPath IPO as I like the RPA space and might, depending on the numbers and valuation, buy into UiPath as well.&nbsp;</p><p>I will keep you updated on any changes and share with you in the analysis of my portfolio companies and companies that are on my target list.&nbsp;</p><p>Have a great week!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Current portfolio positions in random order:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>PINS, PRSM, FB, DIS, ETSY, ESTC,&nbsp;BABA, JD, DBX,&nbsp;BA&nbsp;</p><p>I will also share my &#8220;Target List&#8221; of&nbsp;stocks&nbsp;that I am&nbsp;following&nbsp;closely from now on. I either owned these companies in the past and sold them because of valuation or other reasons, but I still find them interesting in a&nbsp;long-term&nbsp;portfolio. They can also be companies that I find interesting and might add to my portfolio when something fundamentally improves or the valuation changes.&nbsp;</p><p>Disclaimer:&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing contained in this website and newsletter should be understood as&nbsp;investment or financial advice.
