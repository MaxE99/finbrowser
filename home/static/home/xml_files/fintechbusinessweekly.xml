A confluence of factors will shape how the industry changes this year.</p><h4><strong>Regulation</strong></h4><p>Regulation is definitely top of mind this year, particularly after the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-opens-inquiry-into-buy-now-pay-later-credit/">CFPB opened an inquiry</a> into the sector at the end of 2021. Areas the CFPB&#8217;s order highlighted as concerns include the risk of consumers accumulating debt, regulatory arbitrage, and &#8220;data harvesting&#8221; (a <a href="https://fintechbusinessweekly.substack.com/p/super-apps-cbdcs-and-the-rise-of">recurring theme</a> for the CFPB.)</p><p>Looking at the <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_bnpl_sample-order_2021-12.pdf">questions the CFPB is asking</a> BNPL firms, the CFPB is gathered data about how frequently consumers use BNPL (repeat use), for what amounts, category of purchase, repayment method, underwriting, late fees, and loan performance, among other topics.</p><p>Potential rule making seems likely to focus on consumers&#8217; ability to pay, consumer protections (including disclosures), fees, and data collection and sharing.</p><p>The biggest risk from any new requirements is the potential introduction of additional friction into the experience. Collecting data to better assess ability to pay and providing additional consumer disclosures risks eroding one of BNPL&#8217;s key selling points: frictionless ease of use.</p><p>However, any rule making stemming from the market monitoring exercise would take months, if not years, to actually be implemented &#8212; though, as seen in the small-dollar industry, even the <em>threat</em> of rule making can drive significant changes in the market.</p><h4>Credit Reporting</h4><p>Another area destined to impact BNPL in 2022: credit reporting. The big three bureaus are <a href="https://fintechbusinessweekly.substack.com/p/transunion-to-add-bnpl-to-reports">already developing plans</a> to enable BNPL providers to furnish their data. Approaches to incorporating this data vary. Equifax will add BNPL data to consumers&#8217; main credit reports, while TransUnion and Experian will house this data separately from primary reports.</p><p>How might credit reporting impact BNPL providers? The obvious first order impact is that they must develop policies and procedures to ensure data they furnish is accurate and processes for investigating <a href="https://fintechbusinessweekly.substack.com/p/bnpl-furnishing-may-cause-avalanche">consumer disputes</a> about data appearing on their reports, as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act.</p><p>The second order impacts, however, may be more significant. Presently, a user&#8217;s split pay BNPL debt is invisible to potential lenders. As this data is added to the bureaus, BNPL providers will logically be under pressure to incorporate it in their underwriting. Combined with greater scrutiny of how BNPLs evaluate consumers&#8217; ability to pay, this could result in consumers being approved for lower amounts or declined outright.</p><h4>Rising Interest Rates</h4><p>In the face of persistent inflation &#8212; now further exacerbated by Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine &#8212; the Fed has taken a hawkish turn. The Fed has already raised rates by a quarter point and has made clear more, faster rate increases are on the table. The fed funds rate is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/22/traders-bet-the-fed-will-raise-rates-by-50-basis-points-in-may-june.html">expected to reach</a> 2.25% by the end of year.</p><p>How might rising interest rates impact BNPL? Companies offering longer-term, interest-bearing financing, like Affirm&#8217;s core product, have more flexibility to pass along rising rates to borrowers.</p><p>Still, increasing rates should logically decrease demand for borrowing. Higher rates mean higher monthly payments and thus suggest lower approval rates. At the margin, bound by a 36% APR cap (and lower in some states), this could mean some consumers who were borrowing at the upper end of Affirm&#8217;s interest rates are no longer able to do so. Increasing rates also make 0% financing, popularized by Affirm&#8217;s partnership with Peloton, more costly for Affirm to offer. </p><p>And there are some early signs of stress in the securitization market, one way non-bank lenders access capital for longer term loans like the ones Affirm makes. Affirm recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-11/-buy-now-pay-later-lender-affirm-delays-asset-backed-bond-sale">canceled an ABS offering</a> due to &#8216;market volatility.&#8217; If borrowers begin to have trouble making payments and defaults exceed forecasts, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/lendingclub-results-abs-idUSL5N186569">a 2016-like scenario is possible</a>, which saw ABS investors pull back from online lenders, forcing many to throttle originations.</p><p>BNPL providers offering split pay products will face rising rates on their debt facilities with fewer options to pass the increased cost along. A key feature of split pay products for the consumers is that they&#8217;re interest-free. Merchants foot the bill, via the merchant discount rate, but the amount merchants are willing to pay has been coming down as competition in the space has increased.</p><p>BNPL providers could try to make up for higher rates by getting creative with fees &#8212; but doing so risks running afoul of consumer advocates and regulators. Instead, BNPL companies may have to eat higher interest expenses and see their margins suffer for it.</p><p>Banks offering interest-bearing or split pay BNPL products are the best positioned to respond to increased rates &#8212; and, indeed, could even benefit. As banks still have a glut of deposits from pandemic-era stimulus and savings, most are in no rush to increase the rates they pay on deposits. This gives many banks a cheap source of deposits to fund BNPL offerings, while rising rates lets them charge borrowers more for longer-term interest-bearing BNPL plans.</p><h4>Declining Merchant Discount Rates</h4><p>The merchant discount rate is the percent of a transaction a merchants pays to the BNPL for providing split pay financing to their end customer. When BNPL was first becoming popular, this could reach <a href="https://fintechbusinessweekly.substack.com/p/buy-now-pay-later-vs-pos-lending">as high as 7%</a> of the transaction size.</p><p>As the BNPL space has become more crowded, the MDR has declined. PayPal charges merchants the same whether it&#8217;s processing a regular credit or debit transaction or a split pay plan: <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees#fixed-fees-commercialtrans">3.49% + $0.49</a>.</p><p>Presumably, larger merchants, like Amazon or Walmart, are able to negotiate even lower pricing.</p><p>The bottom line is the rate BNPL providers are able to charge merchants has declined, and that is unlikely to reverse.</p><h4>Consolidation</h4><p>As BNPL enters a more mature phase, there are a couple of common strategies to continue growing: moving &#8216;up funnel&#8217; (shopping app, browser extension); offering a physical payment card; geographic expansion; and acquisitions.</p><p>Achieving geographic expansion, growing merchant footprint, and adding BNPL capabilities to an existing stack through acquisitions has contributed to a wave of consolidation in the sector:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/alliance-data-completes-acquisition-of-bread-301186414.html">Alliance Data acquired Bread</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/block-formerly-square-completes-acquisition-of-afterpay-2022-2?international=true&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T#:~:text=Block%2C%20formerly%20Square%2C%20closes%20its,Block's%20lucrative%20global%20merchant%20base.">Block acquired Afterpay</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/paypal-acquires-japans-paidy-for-2-7b-to-crack-the-buy-now-pay-later-market-in-asia/">PayPal acquired Paidy</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/09/aussie-bnpl-zip-closes-296m-acquisition-of-us-player-quadpay/">Zip acquired Quadpay</a> and <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zip-announces-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-sezzle-supporting-sustainable-growth-strategy-and-path-to-profitability-and-equity-capital-raise-of-up-to-a198-7-million1-301491175.html">Sezzle</a></p></li></ul><p>Given the challenges ahead and general lack of differentiation between many players, more consolidation in the space is likely.</p><h4>Potential for Increasing Losses</h4><p>Split pay BNPL is a new and untested form of consumer debt. It&#8217;s unclear how it will perform through the credit cycle &#8212; though, as rates rise, we may find out.</p><p>Many consumers who use BNPL do so in addition to other forms of consumer debt, like credit cards and cash advance services (Dave, MoneyLion, etc.) When these consumers&#8217; budgets come under stress, where will BNPL plans fit in their repayment hierarchy?</p><p>The adage during the &#8216;08 housing crisis was &#8220;you can sleep in your car, but you can&#8217;t drive your house to work,&#8221; a pithy if insensitive commentary on why consumers were more likely to stay current on auto loans than their mortgages (also, foreclosing on a house is a considerably more lengthy and expensive process than repo&#8217;ing a car.)</p><p>Despite the pandemic, we&#8217;ve been in an unusually benign credit environment, thanks to copious government stimulus.

While most press coverage refers to it as an &#8220;open banking&#8221; startup, the company does not provide connectivity to access bank account information (like Plaid or MX), nor does it have the capability to <a href="https://tink.com/blog/open-banking/what-is-payment-initiation/">initiate a payment</a> from a user&#8217;s bank account.</p><p>Instead, Credit Kudos uses third-party APIs to pull bank account data and then analyzes it to generate affordability- and credit risk-related insights &#8212; akin to <a href="https://www.prismdata.com/">Prism Data</a> in the US, the cashflow-based underwriting-as-a-service offering from Petal.</p><p>Paired with other fintech- and identity-capabilities Apple is developing, particularly its <a href="https://fintechbusinessweekly.substack.com/p/what-apples-secret-dmv-contracts?s=w">mobile driver&#8217;s licenses</a> in the US, could enable a number of new products and features for Apple.</p><p>With that context, here are six possibilities for how Apple could leverage the Credit Kudos acquisition in other parts of its business:</p><h4>For Apple Card (US)</h4><p>There was significant speculation that Apple could use Credit Kudos&#8217; underwriting capabilities to bolster its Apple Card offering, currently only available in the US.</p><p>This is rather unlikely. In the US, Apple Card is issued by bank partner Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs is responsible for underwriting applicants &#8212; not Apple. Any decisions about incorporating bank account data would likely come from Goldman, and any technology partners would most likely integrate with Goldman&#8217;s tech stack directly, rather than via Apple.</p><h4>Account-to-Account Payments</h4><p>Also unlikely. When I first read the announcement, I misunderstood Credit Kudos&#8217; offering as the APIs offering access to consumers&#8217; bank account data and ability to initiate payments &#8212; as explained above, that is <em>not</em> the case.</p><p>While adding account-to-account payments to Apple Pay would be a logical extension of its service, that&#8217;s more likely to take place in conjunction with the launch of an Apple BNPL offering (more on that below). Apple&#8217;s acquisition of Credit Kudos doesn&#8217;t immediately give it the ability to do account-to-account payments.</p><h4>For Apple Card (UK)</h4><p>Apple doesn&#8217;t yet offer an Apple-branded credit card in the UK, but it&#8217;s the obvious first choice for expanding Apple Card&#8217;s footprint. Although there are plenty of differences between the US and UK in offering consumer credit, the UK is the largest most similar market (sorry, Canada), and is arguably simpler, from a regulatory perspective, than the US.</p><p>Still, if Apple expands Apple Card to the UK, it is most likely to do so via a bank partner. As such, the same logic as the US would apply: Apple&#8217;s UK bank partner would be the one underwriting the card, and thus would be the party ingesting users&#8217; bank account data, in combination with traditional credit data, to make an underwriting decision.</p><h4>An Apple Wallet PFM Tool</h4><p>This also strikes me as rather unlikely but possible. Could Apple be looking to expand the functionality of Apple Wallet to some sort of Mint-esque PFM tool?</p><p>Acquiring Credit Kudos would substantially advance such an initiative &#8212; and acquiring its talent would help as well. One can imagine Wallet morphing from its current lackluster feature set to a user&#8217;s go-to destination for managing their finances. Being able to connect external accounts and gain meaningful insights about spending and cashflow would substantially bolster the usefulness of Apple Wallet.</p><p>Still, Apple tends to launch major new features in the US. A PFM offering would make more sense in connection with Apple Card, which is integrated into the Wallet app &#8212; but perhaps working with Goldman is proving more cumbersome that Apple wants, and the UK provides an alternative market to roll out and test new features?</p><h4>Apple Device Subscription</h4><p>Apple has long been rumored to be working on transitioning to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-24/apple-is-working-on-a-hardware-subscription-service-for-iphones">subscription model</a> for iPhone hardware. The move could make the price tag of iPhones &#8212; now exceeding $1,000 for top-of-the-line models &#8212; more palatable for consumers by breaking it into a small monthly fee. A subscription model would also make Apple&#8217;s revenue more consistent &#8212; and further lock users in to the Apple ecosystem.</p><p>Apple already offers various ways to reduce or spread the cost of new phones, including trading in old equipment, carrier-related deals, financing from Citizens Bank, and financing tied to Apple Card.</p><p>Moving from external financing partners to a subscription model would give Apple more control over the terms and expand the universe of customers who are eligible.</p><p>Cashflow-based underwriting, like that which Credit Kudos offers, could be a key ingredient to offering an Apple device subscription to users, particularly those with limited credit history.</p><h4>Apple BNPL</h4><p>A BNPL offering from Apple has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-13/apple-goldman-plan-buy-now-pay-later-service-to-rival-paypal">reportedly</a> been in the works for a while now. Reportedly dubbed &#8220;Apple Pay Later,&#8221; the offering would include both shorter-term, no-cost &#8220;pay in 4&#8221; plans as well as longer-term, interest-bearing loans that would be offered through Apple&#8217;s partnership with Goldman Sachs.</p><p>If Apple intends to offer the &#8220;split pay&#8221; portion of the offering itself (and collect the merchant discount rate), cashflow-based underwriting tech like Credit Kudos would help it assess customers&#8217; creditworthiness.</p><p>Still, the attractiveness of entering the BNPL directly has arguably declined since this news originally broke. MDRs have declined and regulatory scrutiny has increased. Perhaps Apple&#8217;s priorities on BNPL have shifted?</p><h4>Something Else Altogether</h4><p>None of these possibilities is a slam dunk &#8212; Apple could be up to something else altogether. And it may be awhile before whatever Apple has planned comes to market. As industry expert Simon Taylor pointed out, it was some two years between when Apple <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/apple/2020/apple-buys-mobeewave-for-100m/">acquired Mobeewave</a> and when that technology manifested as the ability for <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-let-iphones-accept-credit-cards-without-extra-hardware-bloomberg-news-2022-01-27/">iPhones to accept card payments</a> without additional hardware.</p><h2>The Fintech Guide to World-Class Recovery</h2><p><strong>Sponsored content:</strong> The goal of a collections and recovery operation is to maximize profitability by efficiently recovering money lent to consumers while maintaining consumer loyalty &#8212; a tall order for fintech businesses trying to do it all in-house.&nbsp;But there is a win-win strategy out there, and you&#8217;ll find it in TrueAccord&#8217;s latest ebook, the Fintech Guide to World-Class Recovery.</p><p>The recovery and collection process is an opportunity for fintechs to extend the forward-thinking, consumer-centric approach that has made them successful in disrupting the status quo.

Last October, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/10/21/cfpb-big-tech-data-harvesting/">the Washington Post reported</a> (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has ordered six major U.S. tech companies to turn over information about <strong>how they harvest and profit from their users&#8217; payment data</strong>, signaling an aggressive approach to oversight of the financial technology industry by the federal government&#8217;s foremost consumer watchdog.</p><p>The requests cover information related to how companies <strong>harvest and monetize data</strong>, including whether they share information with data brokers and whether they use consumer data for behavioral targeting.</p><p>The watchdog also seeks information on ways that companies try to undercut competitors by restricting users&#8217; choices.</p><p>The requests were sent to Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, PayPal and Square, and the CFPB said it will also study the Chinese payments companies Alipay and WeChat Pay.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>And, more recently, the data practices of BNPL providers have been in the spotlight. Via <a href="https://www.natlawreview.com/article/cfpb-s-latest-orders-place-data-practices-front-and-center-2022">the National Law Review</a>&#8217;s commentary on the CFPB&#8217;s order seeking data from BNPL providers (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>Data Harvesting:&nbsp;</em>The <strong>CFPB seeks data that the companies collect and retain as a result of BNPL product usage, the type of data that is generated from BNPL product usage, and the purpose associated with harvesting different data fields</strong>.</p><p>The information sought relates to &#8220;Direct Product Data&#8221; and &#8220;Indirect Product Data&#8221; and the kinds of data that the companies generate from this data.&nbsp; &#8220;Direct Product Data&#8221; means data collected (and maintained) as a result of consumer&#8217;s use of BNPL.&nbsp; &#8220;Indirect Product Data&#8221; is data that is both (1) generated, at least in part from Direct BNPL Data, and (2) about individual users of BNPL.</p><p><em>Data Monetization</em>: The CFPB is also seeking information about <strong>how BNPL use data or data generated from BNPL data is used in connection with developing, selling, or marketing BNPL products or other products or services</strong>. The CFPB is also looking to understand third-party data sharing and related revenues, and use of BNPL use data or data generated from BNPL use data to sell advertising or targeted offers.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>The CFPB has also made clear it is taking a closer look at the risk of intentional or unintentional discrimination as a result of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models &#8212; going so far as to <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/cfpb-calls-tech-workers-to-action/">encourage engineers and data scientists to become whistleblowers</a>.</p><p>Now, the CFPB is signaling it will be looking for discrimination beyond what is prohibited by fair lending laws by using its authority to prohibit UDAAPs to target potentially discriminatory practices.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-targets-unfair-discrimination-in-consumer-finance/">CFPB&#8217;s press release</a> (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;The CFPB will examine for discrimination in all consumer finance markets, <strong>including credit, servicing, collections, consumer reporting, payments, remittances, and deposits</strong>.</p><p>CFPB examiners will require supervised companies to <strong>show their processes for assessing risks and discriminatory outcomes</strong>, including documentation of customer demographics and the impact of products and fees on different demographic groups.</p><p><strong>The CFPB will look at how companies test and monitor their decision-making processes for unfair discrimination, as well as discrimination under ECOA.</strong>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>In an <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/cracking-down-on-discrimination-in-the-financial-sector/">accompanying blog post</a>, the agency stated (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;For example, Director Chopra <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/remarks-of-director-rohit-chopra-at-a-joint-doj-cfpb-and-occ-press-conference-on-the-trustmark-national-bank-enforcement-action/">has spoken</a> about the work the CFPB will undertake to focus on the widespread and <strong>growing reliance on machine learning models</strong> throughout the financial industry and their <strong>potential for perpetuating biased outcomes.</strong></p><p>Additionally, certain <strong>targeted advertising and marketing, based on machine learning models, can harm consumers and undermine competition</strong>. Consumer advocates, investigative journalists, and scholars have shown how <strong>data harvesting and consumer surveillance fuel complex algorithms</strong> that can target highly specific demographics of consumers to exploit perceived vulnerabilities and strengthen structural inequities.</p><p><strong>We will be closely examining companies&#8217; reliance on automated decision-making models and any potential discriminatory outcomes.</strong>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Ballard Spahr provides additional context in its analysis of the announcement, <a href="https://www.consumerfinancemonitor.com/2022/03/17/cfpb-updates-examination-manual-to-use-udaap-authority-to-target-discriminatory-practices-including-those-involving-non-credit-products-or-services/">saying</a> (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Specifically, the CFPB is directing its examiners to apply the Consumer Financial Protection Act&#8217;s unfairness standard to conduct considered to be discriminatory <strong>whether or not it is covered by the Equal Credit Opportunity Act</strong> (such as in connection with denying access to a checking account).</p><p>Under the CFPA, an act or practice is &#8220;unfair&#8221; if it</p><p>(1) it causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers,</p><p>(2) the injury is not reasonably avoidable by consumers, and</p><p>(3) the injury is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Those who have worked in consumer credit will be familiar with the requirements of ECOA that prohibit discrimination in the provision of credit based on a protected class: race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, receipt of public assistance, or good faith exercise of any rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.</p><p>Consumer lending companies typically have robust internal procedures to ensure compliance with fair lending requirements and will also frequently employ external consultants or auditors as a second line of defense.</p><p>But modern digital consumer finance is heavily reliant on models for functions far beyond underwriting &#8212; they enable automation, speed, and scalability.</p><p>Models are deployed in numerous areas in addition to credit decisions covered by ECOA, including: fraud detection, identity verification, income verification, targeted marketing, direct mail approval/response, transaction monitoring, and even collections processes.</p><p>But these other models historically have received substantially less scrutiny for potentially discriminatory impacts, both within companies and from their regulators.</p><p>Given that this clearly won&#8217;t be the case going forward, consumer finance companies would be well served to examine the types of data they&#8217;re collecting, why the data is being collected, how it is being stored, and how it is being used in models to make decisions &#8212; including having clear, documented policies and procedures for monitoring and testing models to assess their potential to have discriminatory impacts. </p><h2>Most Medical Debts to be Removed from Credit Report</h2><p>The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/most-medical-debts-to-be-removed-from-consumers-credit-reports-11647604803">reported on Friday</a> that the big three credit bureaus, Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion, will begin implementing changes that will eliminate billions of dollars in medical debt from consumers&#8217; credit reports.</p><p>Although the bureaus&#8217; changes have reportedly been in the works for months, news of the planned changes comes just two weeks after the CFPB <a href="https://fintechbusinessweekly.substack.com/p/klarnas-2021-earnings-learn-now-pay">released a special report</a> on the impact of medical debt on consumers&#8217; credit reports. The report found that some 20% of American households struggle with medical debt and that at least one medical collection tradeline appeared on the credit reports of 43 million Americans.</p><p>The CFPB&#8217;s report concluded with a set of recommendations, including assessing whether medical debt should be included in credit reports at all and its intention to &#8220;hold credit reporting companies accountable.&#8221;</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/most-medical-debts-to-be-removed-from-consumers-credit-reports-11647604803">Wall Street Journal</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Beginning in July, the companies will remove medical debt that was paid after it was sent to collections. These debts can stick around on a consumer&#8217;s credit report for up to seven years, even if they are paid off. New unpaid medical debts won&#8217;t get added to credit reports for a full year after being sent to collections.</p><p>The firms are also planning to remove unpaid medical debts of less than $500 in the first half of next year.

Instead, lenders are adding new data sources, like bank account transaction data, and building their own (often AI/ML-powered) internal models.</p><p>In some cases, this may improve a lender&#8217;s ability to approve borrowers who may otherwise be declined. At the same time, it may make it <em>more</em> confusing for borrowers, who&#8217;ve grown accustomed to seeing their credit score through services like CreditKarma, and may not understand why one lender approves them while another declines them.</p><h2>Have We Already Reached &#8220;Peak NFT&#8221;?</h2><p>NFTs are seemingly inescapable lately.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zi12wrh5So">Paris Hilton&#8217;s cringeworthy appearance</a> on Jimmy Fallon, an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/28/nft-vending-machine-new-york-blockchain">NFT vending machine</a>, former first lady Melania Trump <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/02/16/melania-trump-nft-auction/">allegedly buying her own NFT</a>, a NFT <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/03/03/ukraine-nft-fundraising-crypto-airdrop/">fundraiser for Ukraine</a>: NFTs are literally everywhere these days.</p><p>But as celebrities, brands, and advertisers (not to mention scammers, grifters, and shameless opportunists) have glommed on to the trend, is the bloom already off the rose for NFTs?</p><p>Looking at trading volumes on the most popular NFT marketplace, OpenSea, it seems that may be the case:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e118a61-cb15-4caa-8385-951c5b04648f_610x424.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e118a61-cb15-4caa-8385-951c5b04648f_610x424.png" width="610" height="424" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9e118a61-cb15-4caa-8385-951c5b04648f_610x424.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:424,&quot;width&quot;:610,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:86416,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e118a61-cb15-4caa-8385-951c5b04648f_610x424.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e118a61-cb15-4caa-8385-951c5b04648f_610x424.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e118a61-cb15-4caa-8385-951c5b04648f_610x424.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e118a61-cb15-4caa-8385-951c5b04648f_610x424.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Image: <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/46349496-790a-4223-8c65-d6a0bde897bc">Financial Times</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>According to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/46349496-790a-4223-8c65-d6a0bde897bc">FT&#8217;s analysis</a>, the average price and trading volumes are down substantially from February peaks (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;The average selling price of an NFT has dropped more than 48 per cent since a November peak to around $2,500 over the past two weeks, according to data from the website NonFungible. <strong>Daily trading volumes on OpenSea, the biggest marketplace for NFTs, have plummeted 80 per cent</strong> to roughly $50mn in March, just a month after they reached a record peak of $248mn in February.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>The declines have even hit so-called &#8220;blue chip&#8221;

What enabled this rapid transition? Do you see any </strong><em><strong>negative</strong></em><strong> impacts from the rapid transition away from physical cash?</strong></p><p>Richard: China&#8217;s rapid transition away from cash and onto the payment platforms directly resulted from the central bank&#8217;s decision to allow &#8220;big tech&#8221; companies Alibaba and Tencent (WeChat) to enter the payment space back in 2014. The PBOC&#8217;s goal was to increase access to the financial system and saw digital as a tool to accomplish this as traditional banks had reached the limit of their ability to build branches, particularly in rural villages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This resulted in Alipay and WeChat Pay launching in 2014 and fundamentally changing payment in China. The critical thing to recognize about this decision is that the PBOC allowed big tech into the payment space, knowing full well that it would be at the expense of incumbent state-owned banks. This was a courageous decision and one that most cannot imagine Western central banks like the US&#8217;s Federal Reserve ever making. Most consider central banks as supporting incumbents and cannot imagine them making a decision that would cost them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So far, the only negative impact of going cashless has been that people don&#8217;t have the cash to pay for things during natural disasters. So yes, it&#8217;s still essential to have some cash around!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jason: Few Western countries have made similar progress towards going &#8220;cashless&#8221; &#8211; for instance, in the US, cash is still used in about a quarter of transactions. From your vantage point, what differences do you see that account for this slower uptake of digital payments in the US vs. China?</strong></p><p>Richard: The biggest difference is that the US has a well-developed credit card network that is ubiquitous but has high access fees, with merchants paying between 2-5% for the privilege of accepting cards. People don&#8217;t see the merchant fees in their purchase and have grown numb to the &#8220;tax&#8221; they are paying that allows them to receive &#8220;cash back&#8221; and mileage points programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The reliance on credit cards and the reluctance of regulators to approve any new cash transfer systems has delayed free and fast cash transfers in the US. For example, look at how long it has taken the US to get the retail &#8220;real-time gross settlement&#8221; (RTGS) &#8220;FedNow&#8221; system, which may come online in 2023. Other countries like India have had the UPI RTGS system in place since 2016. Frankly, the US has delayed access to low-cost payment systems to maintain the status quo for incumbent bank and card companies.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jason: So China didn&#8217;t have credit cards, allowing them to take the lead?</strong></p><p>Richard: Not really. China never had high penetration of credit cards, but it did have a very high penetration of debit cards back in 2014. Debit cards were behind WeChat Pay and Alipay&#8217;s success as they were required to use the services. The big problem that WeChat and Alipay solved was to give small businesses free access to a &#8220;point of sale&#8221; or POS system. POS systems from the banks were expensive and out of reach for most small businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>To give you an idea of how important small business is to China, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) account for 80 percent of jobs, 60 percent of GDP, and half of the national tax revenue. When WeChat and Alipay launched, all of these SMEs could suddenly take digital payments, which eventually led to China going &#8220;cashless.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jason: One key difference you highlight is the use of QR codes in Chinese payment apps. Why were QRs critical to fostering the adoption of digital payments in China? Why didn&#8217;t US payment apps pursue a similar strategy?</strong></p><p>Richard: There are two reasons why QR codes were not adopted in the West. First and foremost, QR tech back in 2013-14 was considered unsuccessful in the West. It had been used in magazines for advertising but never caught on. So software developers at the time had no concept that it could be used for payment, or at least few did&#8212;more on this in a moment.</p><p>The other reason is perfectly illustrated by the difference between the roll-out of Apple Pay and WeChat pay in 2014. Apple Pay was rolled out in 2014 with great fanfare and the necessity to buy a new iPhone 6 as prior versions of the iPhone did not have near field communication (NFC) technology built-in. In essence, Apple said, &#8220;you have to pay to play.&#8221;&nbsp; Contrast this with the launch or WeChat. The coders who designed the WeChat app were instructed to make it work on the cheapest smartphone available on the market. So when it launched, WeChat simply said, &#8220;try this it's free if you don&#8217;t like it, don&#8217;t use it.&#8221; Street vendors didn&#8217;t even need a phone. Just the QR code printed out on paper was enough to receive payment. WeChat and Alipay both strove to be inclusive on launch, and their success is partly due to their not leaving anyone behind.&nbsp;</p><p>I mentioned above that &#8220;few&#8221; software developers in the West acknowledged QR codes. One that did design Starbucks app that used QR in 2009 and then changed to bar codes on its app. Starbucks&#8217; payment system was larger than ApplePay or Google Pay until 2019. So the funny thing is QR worked in the US too! Apple and Google ignoring QR was a strategic blunder of epic proportions rooted in their desire to sell new hardware.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jason: Your book discusses the peer-to-peer lending boom and bust in China &#8211; a bruising experience for borrowers, lenders/investors, and regulators alike. For readers who may be unfamiliar, can you briefly summarize the episode? What lessons did Chinese financial regulators learn from the episode? How has that episode informed regulators&#8217; approach to subsequent fintech companies and innovations?</strong></p><p>Richard: China&#8217;s fintech experience has not always been a good one. While digital payments are an undisputed success, China&#8217;s experience with peer-to-peer (P2P) loans was a disaster on an unparalleled scale. Estimates are that some $120 billion was lost in P2P markets and serve as an example of what can go wrong when digital markets are inadequately regulated. What the P2P market failure showed was less a failure of regulators to act, they did, and much of what they did was prudent. Instead, it was more of a problem with regulators' inability to act quickly enough to stem the crisis. So I call this a case of analog regulators moving too slowly for the new digital world. China&#8217;s P2P market is a critical story, and it is unrecognized to many in the West. I devote two chapters in Cashless to the P2P story.</p><p>The reason it is so important is that the P2P crisis was finally put to rest in 2018, a mere two years before the Ant IPO. Anyone looking to the root causes of the Ant IPO cancellation should look more toward the P2P crisis than the facile explanation that regulators were so thin-skinned that they blocked the IPO to spite Jack Ma for his controversial speech. While the speech certainly may not have helped Jack and Ant, the real cause for the cancellation was regulators' fear of a credit bubble. Many overlook the P2P debacle, yet it left a lasting and profound impact on the mindset of China&#8217;s regulators.</p><p><strong>Jason: Ant Financial and Tencent have also faced dramatically increased scrutiny, ultimately resulting in Ant&#8217;s IPO being shelved. What are Chinese regulators worried about? What don&#8217;t Western observers understand about the dynamics at play in this situation?</strong></p><p>Richard: The facile answer for the timing of Ant IPO&#8217;s cancellation is that with his speech in Shanghai before the IPO, Jack Ma provoked the regulators, who immediately took retribution by canceling the IPO. With this narrative, Jack Ma is turned into a tragic Greek hero, slain by regulators&#8217; actions reduced to a vendetta against an innovator of mythical proportions who had grown too full of himself.&nbsp;</p><p>While we can never know definitively, I do not believe that the &#8220;pause&#8221; in Ant&#8217;s IPO represented a personal vendetta against Jack Ma due to thin-skinned regulators. Jack Ma may have been outspoken and raised regulators&#8217; ire, but it does not spur regulators to carry out personal vendettas, even in China. What prompts them to act is fear. In China, regulators are still consumed with anxiety that credit bubbles might bring on another P2P-style crisis, and Ant&#8217;s ever-increasing IPO valuation provided ample reason for concern. Ant&#8217;s valuation peaked at $320 bn from an initial $220 bn, meaning that Ant would have to generate additional loans, its primary money-maker, to satisfy investors&#8217; demands for big returns. The regulators panicked when they saw another bubble in the making while still managing the fall out from the recent P2P bubble.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jason: &#8220;Super apps&#8221; feature prominently in the rise of Chinese fintech &#8211; services like the aforementioned Alipay and WeChat. Recently, we&#8217;ve seen US fintechs like PayPal and Affirm claim to be pursuing a &#8220;super app&#8221; strategy. What forces made the rise of a super app possible in China? How is the situation different in the US vs. China regarding super apps? Is the super app model viable in Western markets?</strong></p><p>Richard: Not a day goes by where another Western tech company proudly proclaims its desire to be the next super app. Unfortunately, none have attained this status, although companies like PayPal, Amazon, and even Walmart are certainly getting close. Still, all lack the 360-degree lifestyle services available on China&#8217;s super apps. I don&#8217;t think that Western apps are there yet, not just because financial regulations constrain them, but more importantly because they do not provide a welcoming platform for third parties.&nbsp;</p><p>What made Alipay and WeChat super apps was the use of mini-programs that allowed third parties to build services directly on their app. They welcomed others and made it easy to use not just their payment systems but their log-in and security systems. This made building a mini-program and offering services on their platform a breeze. That openness is still lacking in the West, where Amazon and PayPal see the platform as &#8220;theirs&#8221; and don&#8217;t open it to third parties. I don&#8217;t see it getting any better soon and am amazed that sophisticated Western tech companies do not replicate the mini-program model. &nbsp; What are they afraid of?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jason: You dedicate a good chunk of your book to discussing China&#8217;s CBDC, the e-Yuan (e-CNY), which is already being used by everyday consumers. What do observers in the West get wrong about China&#8217;s CBDC plans? What are China&#8217;s top goals in deploying its CBDC?</strong></p><p>Richard: Rather than being the killer so many predict, China&#8217;s new central bank digital currency, the digital yuan, will have a symbiotic relationship with payment platforms Alipay and WeChat Pay. This may surprise many, who may have read that the payment platforms face certain death at the hands of the digital yuan. This common narrative gets it wrong because it does not take into account the &#8220;stickiness&#8221; of the digital platforms. People will not abandon them en masse because they are simply so useful. No one will spend hours on the e-CNY wallet app, as they do on WeChat or Alipay. Trust me; I have them all!&nbsp;</p><p>Some analysts also make the mistake of seeing digital payment in China as a fixed or static number, a single pie from which e-CNY will take a slice. But this zero-sum perspective ignores the e-CNY&#8217;s potential for expanding the mobile payment market. The digital yuan will increase the amount of digital money in circulation, which will allow even more use of the payment platforms. Put simply, as great as WeChat and Alipay are; there are a lot more payments for the e-CNY to digitize in China.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jason: What can Western governments and central bankers learn from China&#8217;s CBDC?</strong></p><p>Richard: The West is easily a decade behind China in fintech adoption. That may surprise some who feel that Apple or Google Pay are high-tech, but I&#8217;m sorry to report that they&#8217;re not. The real revolution in payment will only occur when payments become free, immediate, and without third parties controlling the payment flow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>China showed how free and immediate digital payment can change the payment system with WeChat and Alipay. In hard figures, China&#8217;s mobile payment market is $66 trillion, representing 4.5 times China&#8217;s GDP. Meanwhile, in the US, the market for all card payments is a mere $8 trillion or one-third of the US&#8217;s GDP. These aren&#8217;t just numbers but show how profoundly digital China has become and how far ahead they are of the West. Therefore, I ask readers who think they currently enjoy a wide array of services with digital payment to consider how many more services must be available in China to get to that 4.5 x GDP figure.&nbsp;</p><p>By issuing a CBDC, China is taking the final step of tokenizing money to eliminate the need for third parties. If China&#8217;s $66 trillion mobile market seems big today, once e-CNY launches, it will explode and get far bigger. What this means in practical terms is that even more of the payment stream will be digitized.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Western regulators need to reconsider the monopoly that card companies and banks currently have on the financial system. Not that card companies and banks are bad, they&#8217;re not, but they have inhibited the growth of payment services because they want to maintain a payment system that has high fees and slow payment times. In issuing a CBDC, governments take a first step in acknowledging that payments are digital infrastructure, just as cash printing and management was infrastructure for another era. CBDCs are the infrastructure that we can build a digital future on where payment is free, immediate, and doesn&#8217;t require anyone&#8217;s permission.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jason: Western governments&#8217; response to Russia&#8217;s recent invasion of Ukraine has escalated more quickly than many commentators expected, including cutting off SWIFT access to some Russian banks and, perhaps more critically, sanctioning Russia&#8217;s central bank. How do you think these actions are being received by the Chinese government? What actions, if any, might China take to protect its own financial system from such threats? Will China use its banking system to help Russia avoid sanctions</strong></p><p>Richard: No, China will not bail out Russia. This is unlikely and is growing less likely by the day as the conflict drags on and the political risk for China allowing Russia access to its banking systems increases. The EU is China&#8217;s largest trading partner, and China does not want to injure this crucial relationship irreparably.&nbsp;</p><p>China has three systems that Russia could potentially use to evade sanctions. They are the CIPS cash transfer system, which replaces SWIFT, UnionPay, which replaces Visa and Mastercard, and finally, new technology China&#8217;s digital yuan. We do not see China rushing in to make any of these systems available to Russia. Most talked about are CIPS and the digital yuan, and there are two reasons why China is unwilling to make them available to Russia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>First, while considered a SWIFT replacement, CIPS is so new that it doesn&#8217;t have sufficient numbers of foreign users signed up to be helpful to Russia. Ironically, some CIPS payments still require SWIFT to make it to the end recipient. The digital yuan is so new it&#8217;s in trial and has no facilities for international transfer, while the digital ruble hasn&#8217;t even entered trials. So while both systems are designed to reduce China&#8217;s dollar dependence, they will take years to attain broad-based adoption and can&#8217;t be rushed in to save Russia.&nbsp;</p><p>The other reason China isn&#8217;t making CIPS and the digital yuan available is that they do not want their reputation tarnished as being &#8220;sanction busters.&#8221;&nbsp; Both CIPS and the digital yuan are designed to help with yuan internationalization. China knows full well that if they are used to bust Russian sanctions, their acceptance in international markets will be significantly diminished. The digital yuan, in particular, is brand new and seeing it dragged through the mud as a &#8220;sanction buster&#8221; would likely kill its adoption, which is certainly not in China&#8217;s interests.&nbsp;</p><h2>NYC Fintech Week: April 18th - 22nd</h2><p>Exciting news!

Whether or not OppFi is the &#8220;true lender&#8221; and thus bound by the California Financing Law&#8217;s 36% cap. OppFi, which is not a bank, works with Utah state-chartered bank FinWise to offer loans at up to 160% APR in California. </p><p>In its suit, OppFi argues that the CFL&#8217;s cap doesn&#8217;t apply for several reasons:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<strong>First</strong>, Program Loans are constitutionally and statutorily exempt from California&#8217;s maximum interest rate caps because the loans are made by FinWise, a state-chartered bank located in Utah.</p><p><strong>Second</strong>, OppFi does not make loans under the Program in California. As such, it is not a &#8220;finance lender&#8221; under the CFL with respect to its Program-related activities, and, therefore, is not subject to the interest rate caps established by AB 539 for those activities.</p><p><strong>Third</strong>, even if AB 539 could arguably apply to OppFi, Section 27 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (&#8220;FDIA&#8221;), 12 U.S.C. &#167; 1831d (hereinafter &#8220;Section 27&#8221;) preempts application of AB 539 to Program Loans.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>It&#8217;s fair to say that the California DFPI disagrees. According to OppFi&#8217;s suit (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;On February 23, 2022, Johnny Vuong, Senior Counsel in the Enforcement Division of the DFPI, acting in his official position and by and at the direction of the Commissioner, informed OppFi that the Commissioner had concluded that OppFi&#8217;s Program-related activities were subject to the CFL and violated AB 539 because, <strong>according to the Commissioner, OppFi is the &#8216;true lender&#8217; on Program Loans</strong>, and the interest rate on those loans exceeds the interest rate cap in AB 539. He also stated that the Commissioner had concluded</p><p>(1) that OppFi had violated California Financial Code section 22303 because the interest rate on Program Loans in amounts under $2,500 exceed the interest rate cap set forth in the CFL; and</p><p>(2) that OppFi&#8217;s purported interest rate violations constitute unfair and deceptive practices under the California Consumer Financial Protection Law (&#8220;CCFPL&#8221;). Mr. Vuong, on behalf of the DFPI, threatened legal action to enforce the Commissioner&#8217;s legal position.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>OppFi&#8217;s decision to fight in California is interesting but not surprising. When faced with a near-identical problem in Washington, DC, OppFi instead opted to <a href="https://fintechbusinessweekly.substack.com/p/what-oppfis-24m-settlement-means">settle the case</a> and stop operating in DC. While it may be tolerable to give up a small market like DC, OppFi can&#8217;t afford to exit a large state like California.</p><p>Yet, the &#8220;true lender&#8221; fight almost feels like a distraction. After all, the object of regulators&#8217; and consumer advocates&#8217; ire is really the interest rate, not who is making the loan. &#8220;True lender&#8221; is just a tactic available to wage that war. I don&#8217;t see many people arguing whether or not Affirm or PayPal is the &#8220;true lender&#8221; of a given credit vs. their bank partners. Nor is anyone, that I&#8217;m aware of, arguing that OppFi&#8217;s bank partner, FinWise, doesn&#8217;t have the right to originate loans to Californian consumers at 160% APR.</p><p>Regulators and advocates should, at a minimum, acknowledge the potential impact of their position. Enforcing a 36% rate cap will result in a reduction of access to credit for those with lower credit scores and for those seeking to borrow smaller amounts.

We work across the sectors that play the greatest role in financial health outcomes - financial services, workplace and health care.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our focus is to&nbsp; improve financial health outcomes for all, with a specific focus on historically underserved populations. We do this via:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Education</strong> to help business leaders and policymakers better understand that financial health is a key driver for business success and economic well being.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Deep <strong>consumer research</strong>, communicating critical data points and analysis, and investing in cross-sector thought leadership.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>A focus on<strong> innovation</strong> by encouraging companies to invest in and pilot technology-led financial health solutions and by actively supporting founders who are designing products and practices centered on improving financial health outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Advise</strong> by developing a deep understanding of the specific needs of an organization's customers, patients, and employees and then helping to deploy solutions, measuring and communicating outcomes.</p></li></ul><p>Our team produces landmark research that delves into the Financial Health of Americans, specifically the <a href="https://finhealthnetwork.org/programs/financial-health-pulse/">Financial Health Pulse Trends Report</a> and FinHealth Spend Reports:</p><ul><li><p>Our <a href="https://finhealthnetwork.org/research/financial-health-pulse-2021-u-s-trends/">2021 Financial Health Pulse Trends Report</a> found that overall financial health in the U.S. improved over the last year, with more than a third (34%) of people in America now considered financially healthy.&nbsp; However, despite government relief programs and changes in consumer spending that helped boost savings and liquid account balances during 2021, a full two-thirds of Americans (187 million people) are still not financially healthy.</p></li><li><p>The <a href="https://finhealthnetwork.org/research/finhealth-spend-report-2021/">2021 FinHeath Spend Report</a> found that Financially Coping and Vulnerable households account for 84% of spending on fees and interest for financial services (for a total of $255B) despite representing less than two thirds of the population. In particular, Financially Vulnerable households spent, on average, 13% of their annual income on the products studied, compared with 5% for Financially Coping households and just 1% for Financially Healthy households.</p></li></ul><p>We are also partners in the <a href="https://savingsproject.org/">BlackRock Emergency Savings Initiative</a>, and in partnership with PayPal, JUST Capital and The Good Jobs Institute on the <a href="https://justcapital.com/reports/worker-financial-wellness-initiative/">Worker Financial Wellness Initiative</a> to help companies understand their worker&#8217;s financial vulnerabilities and improve resilience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our <a href="https://finlab.finhealthnetwork.org/">Financial Solutions Lab</a> accelerator - recently recognized as the 2021 Best Fintech Accelerator by Finovate - seeds early-stage tech companies building solutions to the biggest financial health challenges facing underserved consumers.<strong> </strong>To date, we have have invested in 45 companies with a combined reach of over 10 million customers, at least half of whom are low- to moderate-income</p><p><strong>Jason: A lot of the narrative in fintech around meeting the needs of lower-income consumers is grounded in &#8220;financial literacy.&#8221; Is that the right framework?</strong></p><p>Mimi: Financial literacy can be productive at an individual level, but we believe that financial health is embedded in the daily systems that shape an individual&#8217;s financial outcomes - systems that can deeply affect how they spend, save, borrow and plan.</p><p>Financial health is directly influenced by&nbsp;social and systemic issues that can create barriers and hurdles for consumers as they navigate their daily lives. These are especially present for lower-income consumers who are at greater risk of experiencing income inequity, lack of affordable housing, generational wealth gaps, access to affordable insurance, and access to reliable public transportation to get to their jobs, etc. These barriers are deep and structural and cannot be removed by becoming more financially literate.</p><p><strong>Jason: What is the difference between &#8220;financial literacy&#8221; and &#8220;financial health&#8221;? How do you think about measuring financial health?</strong></p><p>Mimi: Financial health is a composite measurement of a person&#8217;s financial life, specifically how individuals can spend, save, borrow and plan in a way that helps them build financial resilience so they can weather shocks and pursue financial goals over time.</p><p>Financial literacy can help individuals learn more about tools and habits that can increase their financial health, but without income that allows them to pay bills on time, sufficient liquid savings and manageable debt, knowledge and education alone won&#8217;t help people make ends meet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jason: Federal and state governments instituted a wide variety of programs to blunt the economic impact of the COVID pandemic, including direct stimulus payments, expanded unemployment eligibility and benefits, increased SNAP benefits, and the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). What lessons can we draw from these efforts?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Mimi: One of the most critical takeaways from the pandemic is that technology can be used to get services to people that need them most, although challenges persisted to reach vulnerable consumers. However, technology and policy changes based on pandemic-era lessons can make a difference to vulnerable populations going forward.&nbsp;</p><p>An example of how fintechs helped users during the pandemic and beyond is from <a href="https://www.joinpropel.com/">Propel</a>, an alum of the Financial Health Network&#8217;s <a href="https://finlab.finhealthnetwork.org/">Financial Solutions Lab</a> Accelerator. Propel developed a suite of tools to help their more than 5 million Fresh EBT users navigate resources during the COVID crisis:</p><ul><li><p>Propel&#8217;s app <a href="https://www.joinproviders.com/">Providers</a> (formerly Fresh EBT) updated users about national and state-specific policy updates about SNAP, and also carefully vetted resources and offers that would be useful to users.</p></li><li><p>Many Propel users live paycheck-to-paycheck so the team regularly surveys users to understand how the circumstances in their lives are changing or creating greater uncertainty. This <a href="https://www.joinpropel.com/april-2021-covid-pulse-survey">SNAP Household Survey</a> gave&nbsp; insights about how users were experiencing food insecurity, how delivery of services and funds reached household, and about levels of savings and debt.</p></li><li><p>Propel also partnered with <a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/covid-19/">GiveDirectly</a> to help their users access what they ran out of funds and needed immediate assistance. During the pandemic this partnership&nbsp; provided 200k households with a cash transfer of $1,000.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><strong>Jason: One COVID-era initiative, the monthly child tax credit, has recently lapsed. What kind of impact have you seen that have?</strong></p><p>Mimi: The reality of the pandemic played a large role in how Americans were able to navigate their financial lives. Parents were strongly impacted by school closures and the transition to virtual learning, particularly women. In fact, women were more than twice as likely as men to not work due to child care responsibilities in 2021. The proportion of women who reported not working due to the rising cost of and lack of access to&nbsp; childcare&nbsp;has increased by 61% since 2020.</p><p>A recent <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/02/17/child-tax-credit-poverty/">study</a> from The Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University showed that there was a 41% increase in child poverty from December 2021 through January 2022, with an additional 3.7 million children now in poverty after the Tax Credit Expired (with Black and Latino children seeing the biggest percentage point increases).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jason: Bank fees - particularly overdraft fees and non-sufficient funds (NSFs) fees have received increasing scrutiny from legislators and regulators recently, and many banks have lowered or even eliminated these fees. Have establishment banks done enough to create products that work for lower-income and credit-constrained consumers?</strong></p><p>Mimi: This <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennifertescher/2022/01/31/overdraft-is-so-over-banks-regulators-making-financial-health-a-priority/?sh=2f161c046afc">increased focus on consumer financial health</a> is changing overdraft practices and business models from banks and regulators. However, the need for short term credit is still great. Last year, Financially Coping and Vulnerable households ( those who struggle to <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=eh1XZ9v2Qk7LAzk-H_HMpwqZcD-Npjh8V84SIQVDgPPMV66Ax2DpWpB0eIad4cM5bgL6V-TnnuHNG8J5r0HpXgwZIjjxPiggXXCV3YVsY5bv9QAZehD985zrSBOwO145">spend, save, borrow, and plan</a>) accounted for 84% of spending on fees and interest for financial services (<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=hu71xjS51moI0fE6LBXec5iTZyXSGVOEcO0quK6K_pJC45lDMT5QhSbfLkVlrb6pdJinXppBzDskIzQlyElLtaXAhz8Bnn52XH-MNFJCOZeT6jPK8aCHrXMohW_EIOTCCL0SPSxdpy6Sla__t0-Td5kXEbkFE_73myIPzyXpePU=">The FinHealth Spend Report 2021</a>).</p><p>We are very encouraged that many banks have eliminated fees that have a disproportionate impact on the most vulnerable, and encouraged by innovations that fintechs and neobanks are bringing to the market. Fintech firms have delivered cheaper forms of liquidity, like cash flow-based products such as Buy Now Pay Later solutions. Meanwhile, more than 100 traditional banks and credit unions have introduced no-overdraft checking accounts and have seen that uptake was higher than expected.</p><p>Incumbent banks are offering more products that can be used to improve financial health, and the pandemic created an increased focus on digital banking products and technology that can help reach more customers. There is still much to be done, but innovation and technology have a key role to play in reaching customers that previously were left behind.</p><p><strong>Jason: Credit bureaus and credit scores have also received renewed attention from legislators and regulators. What would meaningful reform to this sector look like?</strong></p><p>Mimi: Unlike only using one metric like a traditional credit score, financial health assesses whether people are spending, saving, borrowing, and planning in a way that will enable them to be resilient and pursue opportunities over time.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://finhealthnetwork.org/research/finhealth-spend-report-2021/">FinHealth Spend Report</a> shows that Americans who are least likely to afford it are paying the most in fees for everyday financial services such as credit cards, auto loans, remittances, and overdraft charges, and spend a greater share of their income on those fees compared with those who are financially healthy.&nbsp;</p><p>To create better financial health, consumers need access to low-cost credit that will help them build credit scores over time, and also access to credit with less fees for everyday financial services.</p><p><strong>Jason: Fintech &#8220;challenger banks&#8221; offer an alternative to establishment banks &#8211; but they aren&#8217;t without criticism or drawbacks. For instance, Chime has been criticized for <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/chime">closing vulnerable users&#8217; accounts</a> without notice; some merchants <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/elizahaverstock/2021/12/03/fintechs-fraud-problem-why-some-merchants-are-shunning-digital-bank-cards/">refuse to accept debit cards</a> from challenger banks due to perceived or actual higher risk of fraud. Is the current &#8220;challenger banking&#8221; model the answer to traditional banks&#8217; shortcomings in meeting the needs of lower income consumers?</strong></p><p>Mimi: Fintechs have the potential to improve financial health, especially for underserved communities and low-income people since they aren&#8217;t bound by geographic limitations and can scale quickly.</p><p>Many fintechs are hyperfocused on the user experience and can innovate and pivot more easily to address the needs of customers. Fintechs can also focus on a narrow consumer need; note that not all fintechs are banks, although some of the banks are fintechs.</p><p>Neobanks are continuing to build traction with many relying on interchange revenue from business users as a key driver of their business model, which can often be much higher than fees charged by traditional banks. This is one of the primary reasons why Financial Solutions Lab Accelerator alum <a href="https://digit.co/">Digit</a>, charges a flat, monthly fee for their fintech product. Incentives matter.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jason: Another novel credit product, buy now pay later, has exploded in popularity in recent years, particularly since the onset of the pandemic. While there seem to be benefits to the model (potential for no-cost short-term financing), there also may be risks. How do you think about BNPL in relation to financial health? What steps should BNPL providers implement to ensure they&#8217;re offering their product in a responsible way?</strong></p><p>Mimi: The BNPL market is estimated to have grown by <a href="https://afterpay-corporate.yourcreative.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Economic-Impact-of-BNPL-in-the-US-vF.pdf">300% per year since 2018,</a> and has vast implications on financial health. Our team is working on forthcoming research that will explore the evolving BNPL market to understand how it works, who is using it and what risks/implications they are for consumer financial health and explore what researchers and regulators to consider.</p><p>It is encouraging that the CFPB is looking into rulemaking around BNPL because not all products and options are created equal. To your point, there certainly are risks, but there are also large benefits to those that have less access to traditional credit. If regulated and utilized correctly, the option could be a great tool for financial health.</p><p><strong>Jason: For nearly all Americans, wage employment is their only source of income. What role can (or should) employers have in supporting employees&#8217; financial health?</strong></p><p>Mimi: As workers continue to struggle with finances, they are looking to their employers for solutions. Employers have a role to play in helping their employees manage financial health, and most are aware of the challenges their employees are facing, with many starting to take action to address the challenges.</p><p>Employers can help meet employees&#8217; needs more fully through a holistic and responsive set of benefits&#8211;but first employers need to better understand the financial health needs of the employees, evaluate the solutions and options available as part of benefits offerings and test financial health solutions for their teams.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, an employer may offer retirement planning offerings, but may have a large number of employees who would first benefit from an emergency savings offering or help managing debt. Until those needs are met, those particular employees would not use retirement planning services since their financial health needs are more acute and short term.</p><p>Without analysis and measurement, employers would not understand the gap between what employees need, and which solutions they can offer to help employees the most.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jason: Something I haven&#8217;t asked about Financial Health Network that I should have?</strong></p><p>Mimi: For organizations interested in taking action on their financial health initiatives, we offer a financial health measurement solution as well as consulting services.</p><p>The same measurement framework that is the foundation of our national research, Financial Health Pulse is available to organizations focused on measuring financial health.

As BNPL features become commoditized, companies that began as &#8216;BNPL-first&#8217; offerings are searching for ways to build differentiated, defensible offerings while growing their geographic footprint.</p><p>Both PayPal and Affirm are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/paypal-launches-its-super-app-combining-payments-savings-bill-pay-crypto-shopping-and-more/">re-positioning</a> <a href="https://investors.affirm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/affirm-launches-superapp-and-browser-extension-bring-consumers">themselves</a> as &#8220;superapps,&#8221; offering additional financial products like savings accounts, stocks, and crypto.</p><p>But 17-year old Klarna has arguably gone further, faster. The company has its <a href="https://www.klarna.com/international/press/klarna-europes-newest-bank-is-born/">Swedish banking license</a>, giving it access to cheaper sources of funding than competitors &#8212; particularly important given coming interest rate hikes.</p><p>Klarna has also mades strides in moving from just a payment option at checkout to a consumer destination in and of itself. Like other BNPLs, Klarna has sought to move &#8216;up funnel&#8217; by positioning its website and app as a shopping destination. According to its <a href="https://www.klarna.com/assets/sites/15/2022/02/27195201/Klarna-Full-Year-Results-2021-EN.pdf">2021 annual report</a>, the Klarna app is its single biggest source of GMV across the Klarna ecosystem.</p><p>Klarna has also made significant progress positioning itself not just as a &#8216;buy now, pay later&#8217; company, but as a payment network. Klarna says 40% of its transaction volume uses its &#8220;Pay Now&#8221; option, and it expects that rate to reach 90% for in-store transactions. Behind the scenes, payments can be processed via &#8220;account-to-account&#8221; payments, in many cases avoiding card payment networks altogether. This is possible because of Klarna&#8217;s acquisition of European <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/18/klarna-sofort/">payment network Sofort</a> and <a href="https://www.klarna.com/international/press/klarna-partners-with-gocardless-to-accelerate-expansion-in-the-us/">partnership with GoCardless</a> to power account-to-account payments in the US. </p><p>As BNPLs compete to win customer share of wallet, they&#8217;ve necessarily diversified away from the original pay-in-4 formulation. But with the introduction of a physical payment card with pay-in-30 terms and a rewards scheme, in many ways, Klarna begins to resemble the credit card industry BNPL ostensibly sought to disrupt.</p><h2>CFPB: 20% of American Households Struggle with Medical Debt</h2><p>At this point in fintech, it&#8217;s almost a clich&#233; to talk about &#8220;financial health.&#8221; While this positioning is an improvement from earlier iterations, namely &#8220;financial literacy,&#8221; which carries a certain blame-the-victim connotation, when fintechs talk about financial health, it tends to be siloed to the context of the specific product(s) the company offers: checking accounts, credit, investing, and so on.</p><p>Not that we should need reminding, but, for the typical American household, a major driver of financial insecurity continues to be the cost of medical care. And while insurance coverage has improved since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, in 2020, <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2021/demo/p60-274.html">8.6% of Americans</a>, or about 28 million people, remained uninsured.</p><p>Americans who are un- or underinsured are more likely to delay seeking care and, when they do, pay more for it. Provider pricing practices give discounts to insured patients seeking care with contracted providers, creating the perverse situation where those least able to afford it often end up paying more for the same services.</p><p>Even with insurance, the cost of care can be substantial. And because of labyrinthine billing and insurance payment processes, many Americans can end up with medical bills in collections due to delayed or denied payments from insurance companies.</p><p>The result is a whopping 20% of Americans who report carrying some form of medical debt.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-estimates-88-billion-in-medical-bills-on-credit-reports/">CFPB&#8217;s report</a>, based on analysis of medical debt in collections that is reported to major credit bureaus, found that medical collections tradelines appear on 43 million credit reports.

Those procedures must include, if necessary, taking action against furnishers who routinely report inaccurate information. If furnishers, of medical debt or otherwise, are contaminating the credit reporting system with inaccurate reports, the CFPB expects the Big Three agencies to cut off their access to the system.</p><p><strong>Work with federal partners to reduce coercive credit reporting:</strong> The CFPB is working with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to ensure that patients are not coerced into paying bills more than the amounts due.</p><p><strong>Determine whether unpaid medical billing data should be included in credit reports:</strong> The CFPB will conduct additional research on how medical billing, collections, and credit reporting practices affect patients and families.

Coinbase <a href="https://fintechbusinessweekly.substack.com/p/crypto-bowl-ads-reviewed-coinbase">recently added</a> crypto- and stablecoin-powered remittances, with the option to collect cash at 37,000 retail locations in Mexico.

This should enable it to conduct physical cash in on the US side and cash out on the Mexican side at lower cost than if it had to rely on third-party retailers.</p><p>Physical cash remains the dominant form of payment in Mexico, but adds substantial expense to the remittance process.</p><p>Walmart claims its transactions, powered by establishment player Ria, could cost as little as $2.50 and be as much as 50% cheaper than existing options:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is making it significantly cheaper for its customers to send money to Mexico. Customers can now send money from any Walmart store in the U.S. to any Walmart store in Mexico for as little as <strong>$2.50 per transaction</strong> through its Walmart2Walmart money transfer program &#8212; at least 50% lower than similar offerings on the market.</p><p>This game-changing low fee marks another major milestone for the retailer as it remains committed to providing more inclusive and affordable financial solutions for all customers, including unbanked or underbanked households that rely on services like wire transfers for everyday money management.&#8221;</p></blockquote><h2>FT Partners: February Report</h2><p>FT Partners released its <a href="https://ftpartners.docsend.com/view/ydg9wyysexgeb6xm">February fintech report</a>, which is always worth a read.

Equifax is slated to implement the new coding by the end of this quarter. According to Equifax:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;The new industry code will classify BNPL tradelines, including payment history and give Equifax customers and scoring partners the ability to view and decide how to incorporate the information into their decisioning to potentially open up new mainstream financial services opportunities to more consumers.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Equifax claimed in its announcement that the inclusion of BNPL tradelines would be beneficial for most consumers who pay on time, with an average 13 point increase in FICO scores.</p><p>Experian has taken a different approach and is planning to launch a separate &#8220;specialty&#8221; bureau for BNPL data. Experian has taken this route because, it argues, the inclusion of BNPL data on consumers&#8217; primary credit reports could hurt their scores. In a statement announcing its Buy Now Pay Later Bureau, <a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/news/2022/01/26/buy-now-pay-later-bureau/">Experian stated</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;[T]he majority of BNPL accounts are not reported to credit bureaus because today&#8217;s most used score models are designed to predict risk based on payment behaviors of mainstream credit products, not BNPL accounts. In fact, reflecting BNPL information on credit reports as traditional loans or lines of credit can create negative impacts to consumer credit scores, even when BNPL products are used responsibly. This has, justifiably, prevented many BNPL providers from reporting BNPL payment information.&#8221;</p></blockquote><h4>TransUnion&#8217;s Approach to Adding BNPL</h4><p>TransUnion&#8217;s <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/02/24/2391382/0/en/TransUnion-to-Maximize-Financial-Inclusion-Opportunities-for-the-Nearly-100-Million-Consumers-Using-BNPL-Loans.html">approach</a> is closer to Equifax&#8217;s than Experian&#8217;s. TransUnion will support reporting into consumers&#8217; main credit files but BNPL data will be &#8220;tagged&#8221; and &#8220;partitioned.&#8221; According to TransUnion (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;TransUnion is launching the capability to receive point-of-sale lender trades through the traditional credit reporting process, with specific Metro 2&#174; reporting guidance that ensures FCRA compliance. The goal is to have a single standard for lenders to report data and accelerate adoption by lenders and scoring providers in the future. <strong>The information will be tagged and filtered into a new partitioned part of TransUnion&#8217;s core credit file</strong>.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>TransUnion&#8217;s logic for segmenting the tradelines is consistent with Experian&#8217;s logic for setting up a separate bureau (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Point-of-sale loans are transactional, like a credit card swipe, but they are underwritten as individual unsecured installment loans. Therefore, a consumer with normal shopping habits could originate several loans per year, which most existing credit models view as risky behavior.&nbsp;<strong>This could cause undue impact to millions of consumers&#8217; credit scores, making scores less predictive</strong>.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Companies ingesting TransUnion data will have to <em>opt-in</em> to receive the BNPL-specific tradeline data, leaving existing underwriting workflows and models unaffected. TransUnion argues this will give scoring partners (eg, FICO and Vantage) and companies that use its consumer reports time to understand the impact of BNPL data repayment data. Again from Transunion&#8217;s announcement (emphasis added): </p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Users of TransUnion credit data will be able to opt-in to receive these tradelines as part of their existing credit data delivery. <strong>Default credit report delivery, which feeds existing scoring models, will remain unaffected.</strong></p><p>Over time, as the industry works to enhance models with these data, it is expected that many lenders will choose to use the information in addition to their existing models to help expand their buy boxes &#8211; accelerating the consumer impact.&#8221;</p></blockquote><h2>Citi Largest Bank Yet to End Overdraft Fees</h2><p>Citi made news last week as the first US mega bank to completely do away with overdraft fees. The bank <a href="https://www.citigroup.com/citi/news/2022/220224a.htm">announced its plans</a> to eliminate overdraft fees, returned item fees, and &#8220;overdraft protection&#8221; fees entirely by this summer. At present, Citi charges $34 per overdraft/NSF, up to a max of $136 per day, and $10 for preventing an overdraft by drawing funds from a linked account or line of credit.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb49f4197-72c0-43f4-8a09-10241f2d4f1d_4683x3354.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb49f4197-72c0-43f4-8a09-10241f2d4f1d_4683x3354.png" width="654" height="468.49038461538464" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b49f4197-72c0-43f4-8a09-10241f2d4f1d_4683x3354.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1043,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:654,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb49f4197-72c0-43f4-8a09-10241f2d4f1d_4683x3354.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb49f4197-72c0-43f4-8a09-10241f2d4f1d_4683x3354.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb49f4197-72c0-43f4-8a09-10241f2d4f1d_4683x3354.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb49f4197-72c0-43f4-8a09-10241f2d4f1d_4683x3354.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Image: eMarketer / Insider Intelligence</figcaption></figure></div><p>The move is notable due to Citi&#8217;s size &#8212; it is the fourth largest US bank by assets.

Ads tend to be brand-focused, rather than direct response.</p><p>The success of brand advertising is typically measured using &#8216;softer&#8217; metrics, like whether they&#8217;re reaching the intended audience (GRPs against demo), share of voice, brand awareness, brand sentiment, brand recall, and so forth.</p><p>By contrast, direct response advertising is designed to get a consumer to take an action <em>now</em>, and has more &#8216;performance&#8217; driven metrics, like cost per lead (CPL) or cost per acquisition (CAC) &#8212; think those late night cable commercials that encourage you to &#8220;Call Now!&#8221; A target CAC could be derived from or compared to the lifetime value (LTV) of customers driven from a specific campaign or advert, though tracking and attribution are always a challenge.</p><p>Brand marketing speaks to the top of funnel &#8212; promoting awareness of a brand and product &#8212; while direct response focuses on the bottom of funnel &#8212; driving home a core value proposition and encouraging a viewer to take a specific action <em>now</em>.</p><p>There is a &#8216;third way&#8217; &#8212; so-called brand response advertising, which attempts to blend the two.

From there, it can track how many downloaded the Coinbase app, completed signing up for an account, linked a bank account, and made their first crypto purchase. </p><p>Still, even assuming relatively generous funnel metrics, the CAC for such a campaign was likely several times higher than Coinbase&#8217;s typical campaigns:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feef19b39-cd10-40c3-9550-5f3cd4f8594f_860x194.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feef19b39-cd10-40c3-9550-5f3cd4f8594f_860x194.png" width="860" height="194" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/eef19b39-cd10-40c3-9550-5f3cd4f8594f_860x194.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:194,&quot;width&quot;:860,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:35939,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feef19b39-cd10-40c3-9550-5f3cd4f8594f_860x194.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feef19b39-cd10-40c3-9550-5f3cd4f8594f_860x194.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feef19b39-cd10-40c3-9550-5f3cd4f8594f_860x194.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feef19b39-cd10-40c3-9550-5f3cd4f8594f_860x194.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">A hypothetical analysis of Coinbase&#8217;s big game ad. <a href="https://www.marketingiq.co.uk/drtv-response-rates">Typical response rates</a> on direct response adverts could range from 0.005% - 2%.

Its popularity starting taking off in 2010, when it introduced its OpenBook &#8220;social&#8221; trading platform. Think of it something akin to Robinhood with components of Reddit&#8217;s WallStreetBets or &#8220;FinTwit&#8221; (finance twitter) built in.</p><p>eToro&#8217;s killer feature was the <a href="https://www.etoro.com/copytrader/">ability to &#8220;copy&#8221;</a> top performing investors&#8217; portfolios. The Israeli trading platform was founded in 2007, launching in the US only in 2018.</p><p>The company&#8217;s 30 second advert speaks to this and tries to have it both ways &#8212; <strong>appealing to both crypto and stock traders</strong>. It also identifies its target: those who are interested, but don&#8217;t know where to start.</p><p>The ad leverages <strong>on-screen graphics to demonstrate social features</strong> users are likely to be familiar with &#8212; liking and commenting, as they would on Twitter or Instagram. It also includes a couple subtle nods to crypto memes: &#8220;to the moon,&#8221; a Shiba Inu. </p><p>eToro&#8217;s ad falls more in the brand response bucket &#8212; it clearly messages what the product is (crypto/stock trading), its unique selling proposition (social trading and community), without hitting viewers over the head with a call to action. </p><h4>And the winner is&#8230;</h4><p>If I were making a spot, it probably would&#8217;ve come out something like eToro&#8217;s &#8212; clearly messaging what the product is and why it&#8217;s different/better. But I&#8217;ve always been more of a performance marketer, focused on the math and science of customer acquisition, rather than the creative execution.</p><p>In a high-stakes placement like the Super Bowl, you really only get one shot to get it right; you don&#8217;t have the luxury of A/B testing and iterating your way to the optimal creative execution.</p><p>If measured by interest, it would appear Coinbase is the winner of the &#8220;Crypto&#8221; Bowl:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86ca8795-1e7c-4b2c-93e2-558a5f2ec29e_825x510.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86ca8795-1e7c-4b2c-93e2-558a5f2ec29e_825x510.png" width="825" height="510" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/86ca8795-1e7c-4b2c-93e2-558a5f2ec29e_825x510.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:510,&quot;width&quot;:825,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:47003,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86ca8795-1e7c-4b2c-93e2-558a5f2ec29e_825x510.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86ca8795-1e7c-4b2c-93e2-558a5f2ec29e_825x510.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86ca8795-1e7c-4b2c-93e2-558a5f2ec29e_825x510.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86ca8795-1e7c-4b2c-93e2-558a5f2ec29e_825x510.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Data from Google Trends for the US, which measures relative search interest</figcaption></figure></div><p>But, the metrics that count &#8212; CAC, LTV, and return on ad spend &#8212; will take time to fully materialize.</p><p>Coinbase&#8217;s outlay &#8212; not just the media buy, but also a $3 million sweepstakes pot and $15 giveaway to new accounts &#8212; no doubt made for a large total price tag.

Coinbase planned to offer a similar product, dubbed Coinbase Lend, but <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/sec-spat-with-coinbase-previews-complex-legal-battle-over-crypto-2021-09-28/">canceled plans</a> to do so after warnings from the SEC. Other crypto firms, like Celsius and Gemini, offer similar products, and are reportedly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-26/crypto-lending-firms-celsius-network-gemini-face-sec-scrutiny">under SEC scrutiny</a>.</p><p>Companies like BlockFi and Coinbase are easy enough for regulators to pursue actions against: they&#8217;re centralized and US based. What&#8217;s less clear is how regulators plan to address offshore entities, which may fall outside of their jurisdiction, or DeFi protocols, which have no centralized entity to pursue an enforcement action against.</p><h2>Consumer Advocates Press FDIC to End &#8220;Rent-a-Bank&#8221; Fintech Partnerships</h2><p>With the change in control at the FDIC, consumer advocacy groups wasted no time in pressing the new acting chair to end so-called &#8220;rent-a-bank&#8221; schemes.</p><p>The battles around fintech-bank partnerships, particularly those used to originate loans at rates over 36%, are ongoing &#8212; and not particularly clear cut.</p><p>While Democrats aligned to <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/banking-law/house-votes-to-repeal-trump-administrations-true-lender-rule">repeal</a> the Trump-era &#8220;true lender&#8221; rule, the action had minimal impact, as the rule only covered national, OCC-regulated banks. The rule change had no impact on state licensed banks favored by fintech lenders.</p><p>Last week, the US District Court of Northern California upheld the OCC and FDIC&#8217;s &#8220;valid when made&#8221; rules, dismissing state AGs&#8217; challenge &#8212; but the preservation of that rule may actually lead to <em>greater</em> scrutiny of fintech-bank partnerships.</p><p>Acting Comptroller Michael Hsu <a href="https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2022/nr-occ-2022-13.html">made a brief statement</a> on the decision, highlighting that the improved legal clarity should not be used to facilitate &#8220;rent-a-bank&#8221; arrangements (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Today, the district court affirmed the validity of the OCC&#8217;s rule, which provides that when a national bank or state or federal savings association sells, assigns, or otherwise transfers a loan, the interest permissible before the transfer continues to be permissible after the transfer.</p><p>This legal certainty should be <strong>used to the benefit of consumers and not be abused</strong>. I want to reiterate that <strong>predatory lending has no place in the federal banking system</strong>. The OCC is committed to strong supervision that expands financial inclusion and ensures banks are not used as a vehicle for &#8216;rent-a-charter&#8217; arrangements.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>&#8220;Valid when made&#8221; applies only in cases where a <em>bank</em> originates a loan at a legally permissible interest rate in its home state and then sells the loan; if a regulator or consumer successfully argues a non-bank fintech, not a partner bank, originated a given loan, the rule wouldn&#8217;t apply.</p><p>That line of argument is exactly the one Washington DC&#8217;s attorney general pursued against OppFi and, more recently, Elevate.</p><p>Last week, Elevate reached a <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/subprime-consumer-lender-elevate-settles-with-d-c-authorities">$3.75 million settlement</a> with Washington DC for offering loans in excess of DC&#8217;s 24% usury cap. Elevate had operated in DC in conjunction with its bank partners, Utah-chartered FinWise and Kentucky-chartered Republic Bank and Trust. DC argued that Elevate, not its bank partners, was the &#8220;true lender,&#8221; and thus the loans did not enjoy preemption and were in violation of DC&#8217;s rate cap.</p><p>While local AGs fight jurisdiction by jurisdiction, consumer advocacy groups like the Center for Responsible Lending (CRL), Woodstock Institute, and NAACP are exerting pressure at the national level by encouraging the FDIC, which oversees state-licensed banks, to shut down the practice.</p><p>The <a href="https://ncrc.org/advocates-submit-letter-to-fdic-to-stop-banks-from-fronting-for-predatory-lenders/">group&#8217;s letter</a> argued that state rate caps are the best way to protect consumers (emphasis added): </p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Federal supervision and enforcement of the laws that apply to banks are no substitute for the state rate caps that rent-a-bank schemes evade. <strong>State interest rate limits are the most effective way to protect consumers</strong> from unfair, abusive and unaffordable loans in the absence of a national interest rate limit.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>and further argued that partnering with fintechs originating loans in excess of state usury caps poses &#8220;legal, safety and soundness, and reputational risks&#8221; to banks.</p><p>The group&#8217;s letter argued &#8220;rent-a-bank&#8221; schemes (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Are an abuse of the bank charter to facilitate loans for <strong>non-banks that are the true lender, helping them evade state laws</strong>.</p><p>Lead to abusive lending practices as they divorce lender and borrower incentives, allowing lenders to succeed while causing severe harm to consumers.</p><p>Pose a range of legal, safety and soundness, and reputational risks to banks.</p><p><strong>Carry a high risk of jeopardizing compliance with several federal laws</strong>, including the Military Lending Act, Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act.</p><p>Contradict principles of responsible lending that banking agency guidance has consistently promoted.&#8221;</p></blockquote><h2>The Fintech Guide to World-Class Recovery</h2><p><strong>Sponsored content:</strong> The goal of a collections and recovery operation is to maximize profitability by efficiently recovering money lent to consumers while maintaining consumer loyalty &#8212; a tall order for fintech businesses trying to do it all in-house.&nbsp;But there is a win-win strategy out there, and you&#8217;ll find it in TrueAccord&#8217;s latest ebook, the Fintech Guide to World-Class Recovery.</p><p>The recovery and collection process is an opportunity for fintechs to extend the forward-thinking, consumer-centric approach that has made them successful in disrupting the status quo. This ebook provides the tools and frameworks to ensure that you&#8217;re architecting the right recovery strategy for your company for the long run.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://pages.trueaccord.com/fintech-guide-world-class-recovery.html?utm_campaign=fintech_biz_weekly&amp;utm_source=paid&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Get Started&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://pages.trueaccord.com/fintech-guide-world-class-recovery.html?utm_campaign=fintech_biz_weekly&amp;utm_source=paid"><span>Get Started</span></a></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://pages.trueaccord.com/fintech-guide-world-class-recovery.html?utm_campaign=fintech_biz_weekly&amp;utm_source=paid"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b9a4b46-78b6-486c-bde6-9d8b414f676f_1200x627.png" width="1200" height="627" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8b9a4b46-78b6-486c-bde6-9d8b414f676f_1200x627.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:627,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:974990,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://pages.trueaccord.com/fintech-guide-world-class-recovery.html?utm_campaign=fintech_biz_weekly&amp;utm_source=paid&quot;}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b9a4b46-78b6-486c-bde6-9d8b414f676f_1200x627.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b9a4b46-78b6-486c-bde6-9d8b414f676f_1200x627.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b9a4b46-78b6-486c-bde6-9d8b414f676f_1200x627.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b9a4b46-78b6-486c-bde6-9d8b414f676f_1200x627.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h2>Other Good Reads</h2><p>Don&#8217;t Build Branches in the Metaverse (<strong><a href="https://newsletter.fintechtakes.com/p/metaverse-branches">Fintech Takes</a></strong>)</p><p>The Rabbit Hole Beneath the Crypto Couple is Endless (<strong><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3ab78b/the-rabbithole-beneath-the-crypto-couple-is-endless">Vice</a></strong>)</p><p>Marketplace suspends most NFT sales, citing 'rampant' fakes and plagiarism (<strong><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/nft-marketplace-shuts-citing-rampant-fakes-plagiarism-problem-2022-02-11/">Reuters</a></strong>)</p><p>The 17 Fintechs Most Likely to Get Acquired in 2022 (<strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fintech-acquistion-targets-deals-vc-investors-crypto-insurtech-bnpl-2022-2?international=true&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T">Business Insider</a></strong>)</p><h2>Contact Fintech Business Weekly</h2><p>Looking to work with me in any of the following areas?</p><ul><li><p>Sponsoring this newsletter</p></li><li><p>Content collaboration or guest posting</p></li><li><p>News tip or story suggestion</p></li><li><p>Early stage startup looking to raise equity or debt capital</p></li></ul><p><strong>Feel free to reach out to me</strong>: <a href="mailto:jason@fintechbusinessweekly.com">jason@fintechbusinessweekly.com</a></p><blockquote><h4>Looking for CFPB Highlights Changing Overdraft &amp; NSF Policies and FDIC&#8217;s 2022 Priorities?</h4><p><em>There&#8217;s more Fintech Business Weekly below for paying subscribers</em>&#128071;<em> &#8212; if you already subscribe, thank you for helping make this newsletter possible</em></p></blockquote>

This is particularly important during <strong>incentive campaigns that can be targets for bad actors attempting to reap the benefit from these offers</strong> without ever having an intent to be a legitimate customer on our platform.</p><p>In the fourth quarter, in connection with the increased use of incentive campaigns throughout 2021, <strong>we identified 4.5 million accounts that we believe were illegitimately created</strong>.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>On its <a href="https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/PayPal-Fourth-Quarter-2021-Buyside-Call.pdf">buy side analyst call</a>, Rainey pointed the finger at &#8220;bots that are creating multiple accounts&#8221; in order to collect sign up bonuses.</p><p>Sign up incentives have a long history in consumer financial services. The difference in the digital era, as always, is <em>scale</em>.</p><p>PayPal understandably didn&#8217;t explain the exact weaknesses that were exploited. But, given the ease of digital account opening and of obtaining stolen identity credentials, conducting this type of fraud in an automated fashion, at large scale, is clearly feasible.</p><p>PayPal is far from the only service offering referral or sign up bonuses. Popular neobanks like Chime, Varo, Current, and Revolut have run incentive-based campaigns at various points in time.</p><p>In theory, the requirements to qualify for these referral and sign up bonuses &#8212; which can <a href="https://help.chime.com/hc/en-us/articles/225060108-How-do-I-invite-friends-to-join-Chime-Referrals-">reach a total of $200</a> &#8212; are more onerous, including requirements like a minimum of $200 in direct deposits to a newly opened account. The measure is designed to encourage new users to move their payroll direct deposit in order to get the bonus payment.</p><p>But, in practice, pretty much any ACH deposit will trigger the bonus &#8212; as detailed by numerous websites <a href="https://financialpanther.com/chime-bank-referral-bonus/">like this one</a> that explain how to harvest these kinds of bonus offers (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;While the terms do say a direct deposit is required, in practice, <strong>an ACH push from almost any external bank account will trigger the direct deposit requirement and get you your bonus</strong>.</p><p>To do this, you&#8217;ll want to go log into your non-Chime bank account, link your Chime account to that bank account, then transfer $200 or more into your Chime account. If the transfer works, then the bonus should post instantly, but at most, within 2 business days.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Many neobanks, most of which are still private, and thus have few disclosure requirements, often tout their growing user numbers.</p><p>But with referral + sign up bonuses that are up to 10x as large as what drove PayPal&#8217;s spike in &#8220;illegitimate accounts,&#8221; one has to wonder <strong>if some neobanks&#8217; user numbers aren&#8217;t also inflated by bogus accounts</strong>.</p><h2>Fighting Fraud with SentiLink&#8217;s Naftali Harris</h2><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has come with a truly unprecedented increase in fraud taking place online. There are a variety of reasons why, including the rapid upswing in consumers transacting online instead of in person, financial services companies quickly transitioning to work from home, and trillions of dollars of hastily disbursed government aid in the forms of expanded unemployment, stimulus checks, and PPP loans &#8212; which made ripe targets for fraudsters.</p><p>One company on the front lines of detecting and mitigating various types of fraud risk is SentiLink. I had the opportunity to ask co-founder and CEO Naftali Harris some questions about why fraud has become such a pervasive problem in digital financial services lately.

What were some key learnings from your time at Affirm? How did that experience give rise to SentiLink?</em></p><p><strong>Naftali:</strong> I was the first data scientist at Affirm, and Max Levchin (Affirm&#8217;s CEO) put me in charge of building out the Risk Decisioning team.&nbsp; It was definitely more responsibility than I deserved at the time but a terrific crash course in risk, fraud, and credit.</p><p>One of the key learnings from my experience there was the existence of synthetic fraud, (when fraudsters apply using a fictitious rather than a stolen identity).&nbsp; Prior to seeing this myself, I didn&#8217;t even know this was possible.&nbsp; When we discovered this issue, my then-colleague and now co-founder Max Blumenfeld and I realized there were huge, unsolved issues in the risk world and decided to build SentiLink to solve them.</p><p><em><strong>Jason:</strong> The term &#8220;fraud&#8221; encapsulates a variety of risks at different points in a customer journey. Risks include during account opening, account takeover, transactions, returns, disputes, and so on. What aspects of the customer lifecycle is SentiLink focused on?</em></p><p><strong>Naftali:</strong> Right now we are focused on the account opening process.&nbsp; We work with over 100 financial institutions ranging from top-ten banks to new startups and process around a million new account applications each day.</p><p><em><strong>Jason:</strong> SentiLink is best known for helping firms detect synthetic identity fraud, where a credit bureau profile that isn&#8217;t tied to a real person is used to open accounts or apply for loans. For readers who are unfamiliar, can you describe the basics of how this is possible?</em></p><p><strong>Naftali:</strong> It&#8217;s surprising easy (though don&#8217;t go do this at home&#8211;it&#8217;s a felony):</p><p>First, you make up a fake person.&nbsp; Inventing the name and DOB is easy, as is signing up the identity for a phone number and email, but a lot of people imagine that the SSN would be hard to get.&nbsp; Actually, they&#8217;re nine-digit numbers and most of the billion possibilities are potentially valid SSN&#8217;s, minus certain publicly known exceptions such as SSN&#8217;s that begin with the digit 9 (which are ITINs).&nbsp; Until June 2011, the first five digits could tell you the state and year range in which the SSN was issued.&nbsp; This is public information as well and so fraudsters will typically use an SSN that could have been issued in the last 18 years, so that even if it does belong to someone it will be a minor who is not competing with the fraudster for use of the SSN.</p><p>Secondly, you start applying for credit with the synthetic identity, even if you get rejected.&nbsp; Most people don&#8217;t know this but actually the act of applying for credit will create provisional credit reports at the bureaus.&nbsp; Eventually the fraudsters are able to get their identities added to the bureaus.</p><p>Thirdly, you boost the synthetic identity&#8217;s credit.&nbsp; It&#8217;s possible to do this very quickly, for example, by purchasing authorized user tradelines for the synthetic identity.</p><p>Finally, you use that synthetic identity&#8211;which now has good credit&#8211;to apply for loans and not repay.</p><p>Doing this has become so commonplace that you can now even find tutorials for how to do this online.</p><p><em><strong>Jason:</strong> But SentiLink&#8217;s offerings go beyond this &#8211; what other capabilities does SentiLink provide?</em></p><p><strong>Naftali:</strong> We also help to detect ID theft, help satisfy obligations from the various KYC/CIP regulations, were the first company to go live with eCBSV, and have some products we&#8217;re developing around first party fraud.</p><p><em><strong>Jason:</strong> What is different about detecting a stolen identity vs. synthetic?</em></p><p><strong>Naftali:</strong> They&#8217;re two fundamentally different problems&#8211;for synthetic fraud, you&#8217;re checking whether the identity that is being used to apply is cohesive (i.e. all belongs to the same, real person).&nbsp; But with ID theft you&#8217;re checking whether the identity that is applying actually belongs to the person who is applying.</p><p>As a result, lots of the things you do to prevent ID theft (such as checking if there is a phone number that ties to the identity that the applicant can prove they control) don&#8217;t work for preventing synthetic fraud.&nbsp; Conversely, most things that prevent synthetic fraud don&#8217;t work for ID theft, given that fraudsters steal the identities of real people.</p><p>One other particular challenge with synthetic fraud compared to ID theft though is that ID theft has a direct consumer victim, who often eventually finds out that their identity has been misused and alerts the relevant financial institutions.&nbsp; Synthetic fraud doesn&#8217;t have that same direct consumer victim, and so losses associated with synthetic fraud can often go undetected and mistaken for credit losses.</p><p><em><strong>Jason:</strong> What is the relationship between &#8220;fraud&#8221; and other fin-crime risks, like money laundering?</em></p><p><strong>Naftali:</strong> They&#8217;re all related, given that oftentimes the same fraudsters are committing them.&nbsp; In particular though, account opening fraud at institutions that allow money transfers (including checking and savings products, money transfer products, crypto exchanges or wallets, and even brokerage or other investment products) facilitates money laundering.</p><p><em><strong>Jason:</strong> Why aren&#8217;t KYC/AML checks sufficient to stop fraud?</em></p><p><strong>Naftali:</strong> They actually are sufficient, just not in the way that some in our industry are interpreting them.&nbsp; If you read the CIP rules (<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/31/1020.220">https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/31/1020.220</a>), they say quite simply that you must establish procedures that enable you &#8220;to form a reasonable belief that [you] know the true identity of each customer.&#8221;&nbsp; Obviously, if an organization is letting through a lot of identity fraud, (either ID theft or synthetic fraud), then those procedures clearly did not allow them to form that reasonable belief and arguably that organization is not in compliance.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a bit of a tautology, but the CIP rules actually do require you to have procedures that are reasonably good at stopping fraud!</p><p>Unfortunately, some in the industry interpret the CIP rules as requiring you to check for a &#8220;match&#8221; of the four CIP elements (name, DOB, SSN or other identifier, and address).&nbsp; In addition to complying with neither the letter nor the spirit of the CIP rules, as typically implemented these &#8220;match-based&#8221; checks are also nearly useless at stopping fraud.</p><p>For synthetic fraud, the reason they are so ineffective is that a &#8220;match&#8221; is typically defined as the identity having some prior financial records, which under the hood usually means they have a credit report.&nbsp; Because the fraudsters are easily able to create these records for synthetic identities, these &#8220;KYC checks&#8221; will always return matches on all four data elements.</p><p>For ID theft, the reason these match level checks are so ineffective is that the fraudsters steal identities of real people, whose name, DOB, SSN, and usually address will match their preexisting financial record.&nbsp; Of course, the fraudster is the one submitting the application but there&#8217;s no way to tell with these data elements.</p><p>SentiLink&#8217;s KYC Insights product takes a first principles approach to KYC compliance&#8211;starting with literally reading the regulations&#8211;to help financial institutions fight fraud and comply with the CIP and red flags rules.</p><p><em><strong>Jason:</strong> Fraud is a pervasive problem in the US banking and fintech ecosystem &#8211; something that was turbocharged during COVD-19. What events/trends of the pandemic gave rise to this massive spike in fraud? Who&#8217;s responsible? What can be done to better mitigate it?</em></p><p><strong>Naftali:</strong> There were really two issues that caused this.</p><p>Firstly, the PPP program was designed to move as much money to deserving businesses as fast as possible, prioritizing speed and availability over risk controls.&nbsp; The government guarantee of these funds to participating lenders in particular removed nearly all of the financial risk to the lenders, who were encouraged by policymakers to push money out the door as quickly as possible.&nbsp; Given the strong public interest in helping struggling businesses, on the whole this was not necessarily bad policy from Congress, but the speed and urgency did lead to a downside of increased fraud levels.</p><p>Secondly, many of the unemployment insurance programs offered by the states turned out to be very poorly designed from a risk perspective when stress tested.&nbsp; In some of the cases, the states were not doing very basic checks, and their UI risk programs would shock anybody with even a passing interest in fraud and identity.&nbsp; Not only did a lot of them let through an enormous amount of fraud, but there were also numerous reports of citizens who had a hard time acquiring the benefits to which they were entitled.&nbsp; Better controls here (both from a loss mitigation perspective as well as a customer experience perspective) would help.</p><p><em><strong>Jason:</strong> There&#8217;s a perception that &#8220;fintechs,&#8221; especially neobanks and wallets, are more susceptible to fraud than &#8220;incumbents&#8221; (banks). In your experience, is that perception accurate? Why would this be the case?</em></p><p><strong>Naftali:</strong> No.&nbsp;I&#8217;ve seen traditional financial institutions with very high and very low fraud rates, as well as fintechs with very high and very low fraud rates.&nbsp; In general, traditional financial institutions often benefit from institutional experience&#8211;their people and their systems are inoculated against fraud attempts they&#8217;ve seen even 10+ years prior.&nbsp; But fintechs often are faster moving and have more creative controls.</p><p><em><strong>Jason:</strong> How does fraud risk vary by product type? Eg, bank account vs. installment loan vs. pay-in-4 BNPL?</em></p><p><strong>Naftali:</strong> This varies over time based on what the fraudsters choose to target.&nbsp; For example, at the height of the pandemic we saw a huge influx of fraud in checking and savings accounts, related to fraudsters stealing identities and opening DDAs in order to launder UI funds they&#8217;d stolen.</p><p><em><strong>Jason:</strong> Who is bearing the cost of fraud? How is this liability determined?</em></p><p><strong>Naftali:</strong> For most of the account opening fraud that we tackle, losses are borne by the financial institution where the fraudster opened the account.&nbsp; For example, when a fraudster steals an identity and uses it to open a credit card, the credit card issuer will be liable for any balances that the fraudster runs up and doesn&#8217;t pay.</p><p><em><strong>Jason:</strong> What role do (should? can?) regulators play in addressing fraud?</em></p><p><strong>Naftali:</strong> The most important role regulators should play in addressing fraud is being clear about the regulatory obligations financial institutions have in stopping fraud, and offering more clear guidance about these rules.&nbsp; Ultimately, financial institutions are the ones who operate and control their fraud programs, and so most of the work that needs to happen has to happen at the financial institution.</p><p><em><strong>Jason:</strong> Given the sheer scale of transactions, an automated approach (eg models, AI, etc.) is required. But, models inevitably will have false positives (transactions flagged that are legitimate) and false negatives (fraudulent transactions that slip through). How does SentiLink (or, in practice, SentiLink&#8217;s customers) think about balancing these, when tuning these models?</em></p><p><strong>Naftali:</strong> How organizations think about balancing false positives and false negatives depends on their business and risk philosophy.&nbsp; For example, some customer-centric companies we work with are very sensitive to false positives on returning users, and so will do more up-front verification work and suffer higher false positives for new users, in exchange for tuning models down to be more lenient on returning users.&nbsp; Some companies we work with are very sensitive to only having high quality loans, and so will tune the models to have fewer false negatives and more false positives.</p><p>In order to help our partners make the right decisions for them, at SentiLink we actually provide precision, recall, false positive and false negative tables to our partners based on manual reviews that our Risk Operations team conducts.&nbsp; Given that the performance of our scores varies partner by partner, these analyses are actually specific to each partner.</p><p><em><strong>Jason:</strong> What is the craziest case of fraud you&#8217;ve ever seen? How have you seen fraud vectors evolve since you first began working in the space?</em></p><p><strong>Naftali:</strong> Well I&#8217;ve seen a whole lot of crazy stuff, but the most recent memorable one was an application for Elvis that we came across a few weeks ago.&nbsp; Whoever was submitting the application even found Elvis&#8217;s real SSN and used that as well.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t a particularly hard case but it was certainly a lot of fun to review!</p><p>That particular case aside, the fraudsters have gotten smarter over time and a lot of the fraud that we come across now is more sophisticated compared to a few years ago.&nbsp; Fraudsters are some of the most creative people out there, and at SentiLink we frequently joke that if they decided to employ their talents to better society rather than steal from it then in a few years we&#8217;d all be enjoying our flying cars.</p><p><em><strong>Jason:</strong> How do you think identity verification will evolve? Defi? Digital driver&#8217;s licenses? What opportunities and risks do new technologies like these pose in the effort to mitigate fraud?</em></p><p><strong>Naftali:</strong> I think there will be increased centralization of identity over time.&nbsp; Right now identity is so fragmented, with each part of someone&#8217;s identity stored in a different place.&nbsp; Being able to connect those fragmented parts of someone&#8217;s identity can have a huge impact and enable us all to prove who we are more seamlessly.&nbsp; I believe that over the long run as society gets better at identity verification, authentication will even come to many (non-financial) contexts where there previously wasn&#8217;t any identity verification simply because of difficulty and expense.</p><p><em><strong>Jason:</strong> Anything I haven&#8217;t asked about SentiLink that I should have?</em></p><p><strong>Naftali:</strong> You didn&#8217;t ask how we name our conference rooms!&nbsp;

As of 2020, France boasts a population of about 67 million, making it the second most populous country in the EU, behind Germany.</p><p>France, an economic powerhouse in the EU, also comes in second when measured by GDP, again behind Germany, at USD $2.63 trillion. Despite Americans&#8217; perception of Europe in general and France in particular as having a generous social safety net, its poverty rate is 13.6% &#8211; ahead of the US&#8217; 11.4% <em>(note: definitions of &#8216;poverty&#8217; vary and both metrics pre-date the coronavirus pandemic)</em>.</p><p><strong>Banking in France &#8211; A Concentrated Affair</strong></p><p>France boasts 337 banks &#8211; which, if you&#8217;re used to the American banking market, probably sounds low. The US, with ~5x the population, has nearly <em>15x</em> the number of licensed banks (and that doesn&#8217;t even count an additional ~5,400 credit unions).</p><p>It should be unsurprising then that banking concentration is substantially higher in France than the US; the largest three banks &#8211; BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole, and Societe Generale &#8211; hold a whopping 57% of assets in the banking sector. While the US is also dominated by large banks, the biggest three hold a comparatively small 35% of total assets.</p><p>Like most of the Western world, the number of bank <em>branches </em>has been steadily declining as adoption of digital banking channels increases. The number of <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FB.CBK.BRCH.P5?locations=FR-US">bank branches per 100,000</a> adults has declined from 45.9 in 2006 to 33.2 in 2020, compared to 29.7 per 100,000 adults in the US in 2020.</p><p>Consumer banking penetration is extremely high, with 94% of adults over 15 having access to a bank account &#8211; though this has actually dropped 2% points since 2014, according to World Bank data.</p><p>Credit card usage in France is markedly lower than the US. While 66% of American adults own at least one credit card, the proportion in France is just 41%.</p><h4><strong>French Financial Life: La Vie En Rose&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>Perhaps ironically, culture is one the toughest forms of capital to quantify. Culture influences everything from fashion to art to food. It both informs and signals our identity. Broadly speaking it impacts economic behavior: consumer spending, risk-aversion, socio-economic stratification, and savings goals to name a few. Which is why it's important to consider a country's culture when evaluating their financial system. We already stated that France is an economic powerhouse &#8212; and certainly boasts world renown for the aforementioned fashion, art and food categories &#8212; but let's explore some other cultural elements that contribute to a unique fintech ecosystem.</p><p>The French are no strangers to bureaucracy, but the tradeoff provides some fairly cushy state benefits that most Americans would salivate over.

But as it turns out, the French are <em>thriftier</em> than you might expect. According to a report from BNP Paribas, they outpace the average savings rate in the eurozone and rank #1 among the major economies in the region:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<strong>France</strong> (14% in 2018), behind Germany (17.9%) and the Netherlands (15.1%), <strong>is the major eurozone country with the highest household savings rate</strong> (average of 12% across the eurozone).&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>For context, that's on par with the personal savings rate in the US at the end of 2020 (13.7% according to the Federal Reserve research), though somewhat misleading due to the COVID-19 pandemic savings boom &#8212; a typical pre-pandemic rate in the US was ~7%.&nbsp;</p><p>Which brings us to our final cultural flashpoint that distinguishes the US and France: <strong>living within your means</strong>.</p><p>One might attribute this to differences inherent to a capitalist versus socialist society. But I would argue that's not quite right. You see, the French enjoy the finer things in life, in fact, they savor them. French cuisine, domestic wine, an evening with close friends and family. When it comes to experiences, especially with loved ones, paying a premium is tolerated, even welcome. But it's about the company and quality of the experience, not a materialistic display of wealth.</p><p>The &#8220;American&#8221; dreams of a new Rolex, a bigger house than his neighbor, or an ostentatious vacation home; the "Frenchman&#8221; dreams of a vintage Rhone Valley bottle of red, a pied-a-terre in Paris housing philosophy books, and a yearly trip to a modest, clandestine beach destination. It's subtle, but different.</p><p>The catalyst that enables this spending discrepancy is somewhat obvious to those living abroad: <strong>consumer credit</strong>. You can't go an hour in the US without being bombarded with adverts for a personal loan, buy now pay later product, or new credit card offering a huge signup bonus, giving you the opportunity to acquire the next shiny object on your list. Here's the thing: credit cards <em>don't really exist</em> in France. You have what's called a Carte Bancaire (CB) that works like a debit card, but getting a line of credit is reserved for rare occasions:</p><ul><li><p>Buying an appliance at Darty (yes, the French version of Best Buy sounds like a day-drinking event at a sorority) that offers revolving credit</p></li><li><p>A home loan or mortgage (emprunt immobilier), the preferred wealth-building method of the French, as we'll explore later</p></li><li><p>Traditionally, for those day-to-day purchases, it was more challenging to find credit, requiring a trip to your local bank and a mountain of paperwork. Today, thanks to several emerging players in fintech offering micro-loans or BNPL, that is beginning to change, and even significant purchases can be financed through a digital platform at modest interest rates</p></li></ul><p>So despite a vast social safety net and a dearth of consumer credit (at least as we Americans perceive it), the French save more and buy less. Your average microeconomics professor might be stumped, but even a novice social anthropologist could trace it back. There's a saying in France, popularized by the Edith Piaf song: La Vie en Rose (life through rose colored glasses). The idea is to see the beauty in life, the simple things, even when times are tough an apt expression that one might surmise is baked into the culture itself.</p><h4><strong>Yes, More Regulation &#8211; But That&#8217;s Not Always a Bad Thing!</strong></h4><p>At this point, it&#8217;s a bit of a worn cliche to bemoan the bureaucracy in Brussels, the location of the EU&#8217;s executive body, the European Commission. Given the organs of EU governance are charged with formulating and implementing policy across 27 discrete countries, that the wheels of its bureaucracy turn slowly shouldn&#8217;t be too much of a surprise.</p><p>In general, approaches to regulation are formulated at the EU-level by European supervisory agencies (ESAs), which include the EBA for banking activities, the ESMA for financial markets, and EIOPA for insurance markets. These EU-level formulations are guided by global recommendations from bodies like the Basel Committee (safety and soundness) and the Financial Action Task Force (financial crime/money laundering).&nbsp;</p><p>ESAs develop regulatory technical standards, implementing technical standards, and Q&amp;As that guide implementation by national-level governments and regulators; the goal is to achieve consistency in implementation across EU countries.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F421433cc-8a44-4c0b-8e12-1024e39455f2_1436x808.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F421433cc-8a44-4c0b-8e12-1024e39455f2_1436x808.png" width="1436" height="808" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/421433cc-8a44-4c0b-8e12-1024e39455f2_1436x808.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:808,&quot;width&quot;:1436,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F421433cc-8a44-4c0b-8e12-1024e39455f2_1436x808.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F421433cc-8a44-4c0b-8e12-1024e39455f2_1436x808.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F421433cc-8a44-4c0b-8e12-1024e39455f2_1436x808.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F421433cc-8a44-4c0b-8e12-1024e39455f2_1436x808.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>In France, the two key regulators are the Autorit&#233; des march&#233;s (<strong>AMF</strong>, the financial markets authority, somewhat comparable to a combination of the SEC and CFTC) and the Autorit&#233; de contr&#244;le prudentiel et de r&#233;gulation (<strong>ACPR</strong>, the banking and insurance authority, roughly approximate to the OCC, FDIC, parts of the Fed, and state insurance regulators rolled up into one).</p><p>Going into the full scope of EU directives and French implementing laws and regulations is beyond the scope of this humble newsletter, but it&#8217;s worth reviewing the elements most relevant to the fintech ecosystem.</p><p><strong>France&#8217;s Fintech- and Crypto-Friendly Licensing</strong></p><p><em>&#8216;Traditional&#8217; Bank License</em></p><p>A traditional banking license (&#8220;credit institution&#8221;) is required to hold deposits, engage in banking payments, or engage in credit transactions, though specialized consumer finance firms associated with retailers/auto and, more recently, peer-to-peer lending also exist under different licenses.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Crowdfunding &amp; Crowdlending</em></p><p>Dating to 2014, France created a framework for crowdfunding (equity or debt investments) and crowdlending (peer-to-peer lending). France&#8217;s crowdfunding framework is roughly analogous to the US SEC&#8217;s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/exemptofferings/regcrowdfunding">Regulation Crowdfunding</a>. France&#8217;s regulation of crowdlending provides a significantly streamlined licensing and regulatory approach vs. what needs to be navigated by the few remaining American peer-to-peer lenders like Prosper.</p><p><em>Payment Institution / e-money Institution</em></p><p>French regulation permits licensing of <a href="https://acpr.banque-france.fr/en/authorisation/banking-industry-procedures/licensing-authorisation-and-registration/payment-institution-and-account-information-service-provider">payment institutions</a> and <a href="https://acpr.banque-france.fr/en/authorisation/banking-industry-procedures/licensing-authorisation-and-registration/electronic-money-institution">e-money institutions</a>, which are the frameworks under which French &#8220;neobanks&#8221; operate &#8211; though note that in 2021, the ACPR prohibited use of the term &#8216;neobank,&#8217; arguing that because firms in this category are not licensed credit institutions (banks), they cannot use this term to describe themselves (not unlike Chime&#8217;s run-in with California&#8217;s DFPI).</p><p>Capabilities of payment institutions and e-money institutions include:</p><ul><li><p>Services enabling cash to be deposited into or withdrawn from a payment account and the transactions required to manage such an account;</p></li><li><p>Execution of payment transactions associated with a payment account (card payments, credit transfers and direct debits);</p></li><li><p>Transmission of funds;</p></li><li><p>Payment initiation and account information services;</p></li><li><p>Issuance of means of payment and/or acquisition of payment orders.</p></li></ul><p>A simplified licensing procedure is available for payment institutions processing less than &#8364;3 million per month and e-money institutions processing less than &#8364;5 million per month.</p><p>The result is an easier, faster, cheaper licensing model for nascent fintechs that avoids the complexity and regulatory uncertainty of the bank partnership model leveraged by US neobanks.</p><p><em>Digital Asset Service Providers (eg, crypto)</em></p><p>The PACTE Act of 2019, amended in 2020, creates a new category of entities known as Digital Asset Service Providers (DASPs). Services entities in this category may offer include asset custody, exchange cryptocurrencies for fiat and vice versa, digital asset trading, and a variety of other related services. Some aspects of the licensing framework are optional, though asset custody and exchanging to/from fiat require registration with the AMF.</p><p>This arguably compares favorably to the US, where there remains no crypto-specific legislation/regulation whatsoever and, instead, regulators apply existing frameworks, some of which date to the 1930s, to the rapidly evolving digital asset space.</p><h4>Robinwho? Savings and Retail Investing in France</h4><p>In the US most folks are comfortable with terms like 401k, Roth IRA and index funds, but the recent upswing in day trading brought on by neo-brokerage apps like Robinhood has redefined the retail investing category.</p><p>Anecdotally, I've witnessed more acquaintances in the US enter their hat in the ring, tempted by volatile markets and a penchant for the dopamine hits associated with <em>winning big</em>. Americans don't have a monopoly on gambling by any means, but if I were a betting man, the get-rich-quick mentality surrounding today's financial markets just isn't as appetizing or accessible in France. In fact, the two most popular savings channels in France are quite conservative by comparison: the <em>Livret A</em> and the <em>Assurance Vie</em>.</p><p><em>*Note: this is an oversimplification of savings/investment methods, but I'm sharing the mechanisms most commonly used.&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>Livret A</strong></p><ul><li><p>The Pros: A short term savings vehicle with low interest rates (.5%), no fees, and 100% guaranteed (i.e. risk-free) and exempt from social security taxes</p></li><li><p>The Cons: Maximum total deposit of &#8364;22,950 for individuals, a fairly pathetic return (doesn't even outpace inflation), it's primarily a holding pen for cash looking for better than zero return but seeking a higher yield investment</p></li><li><p>Key Stat: 9/10 French citizens have a Livret A</p></li><li><p>Fun Fact: This financial innovation was created in 1818 and was accessible to everyone with a 2000 franc cap and a 5% interest rate</p></li></ul><p><strong>Assurance Vie</strong></p><ul><li><p>The Pros: Higher interest rate (closer to 2% depending on the offer/year), better service from the bank, the capital is deployed (instead of sitting in a checking account) and you have say in where to deploy it, you can choose a beneficiary in the event of your death, tax exempt for the duration of the contract, capital is guaranteed 100%</p></li><li><p>The Cons: it's an 8 year commitment (can't touch it!) and may incur service fees depending on the plan you choose</p></li><li><p>&nbsp;Key State: Only 37% of French citizens have invested in an Assurance Vie</p></li><li><p>Fun Fact: In the late 1700s life insurance policies were considered "reprobate and against good morals" by the Ordonnance de Colbert (it wasn't until 1818 they were legalized)</p></li></ul><p>That said, the immense progress in digital banking and neo-broker market penetration is shifting the landscape. Investing directly in the <em>Bourse</em> (stock market) is more accessible than ever through online brokers and high throughput trading apps (Robinhood dopp&#235;lgangers) have onboarded a new generation of millennial and Gen Z investors right from their mobile device.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7be67d5d-6132-4ec0-85ad-f2a91dab41a5_987x620.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7be67d5d-6132-4ec0-85ad-f2a91dab41a5_987x620.png" width="987" height="620" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7be67d5d-6132-4ec0-85ad-f2a91dab41a5_987x620.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:620,&quot;width&quot;:987,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7be67d5d-6132-4ec0-85ad-f2a91dab41a5_987x620.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7be67d5d-6132-4ec0-85ad-f2a91dab41a5_987x620.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7be67d5d-6132-4ec0-85ad-f2a91dab41a5_987x620.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7be67d5d-6132-4ec0-85ad-f2a91dab41a5_987x620.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h4><strong>Interchange, Open Banking &amp; Other Key Regulatory Differences</strong></h4><p><em>Interchange</em></p><p>The EU, including France, lack a regulatory quirk that has powered a good chunk of US consumer fintech innovation: debit interchange. While interchange for debit cards issued by small banks (&lt; $10 billion) in the US remains uncapped, in the EU, transactions are typically capped at 0.2% &#8211; a far cry from the ~1.5% common in the US.</p><p>The stark difference in interchange revenue, while undeniably a benefit to French merchants (and, by extension, consumers), provides French fintechs with fewer paths to monetization.</p><p><em>PSD2 / Open banking</em></p><p>&#8220;Open banking&#8221; in the US has evolved quite differently than in the EU. The EU has taken a regulatory-led approach, in the form of <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/payment-services-psd-2-directive-eu-2015-2366_en">PSD2</a> (payment services directive), whose original intent was to promote competition and innovation by requiring banks to provide secure APIs to share customer data and enable third parties to initiate payments. In the US, so far, open banking has been market-led, in the form of private banking connectivity providers like Plaid and MX, though the CFPB is beginning to undertake rulemaking as called for in Dodd-Frank.</p><p><em>Passporting</em></p><p>One of the most appealing benefits of operating in the EU is the ability to &#8220;passport&#8221; a license granted by one country&#8217;s regulator to operate in other countries. This can be done by opening a physical branch in another country (freedom of establishment) or without a physical presence (freedom to provide services.)</p><p>European neobanks like N26 and bunq, which are fully licensed banks in their respective home countries, leverage passporting to operate in multiple European countries. More recently, Revolut was awarded its Lithuanian banking license, and is in the process of transitioning European customers from its e-money institution entity to its full banking entity.</p><p><em>CBDC: A Digital Euro</em></p><p>Like seemingly every central bank these days, the European Central Bank (ECB) is studying the pros and cons of introducing a Euro central bank digital currency (CBDC). The ECB kicked off a <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/ecb-starts-24-month-digital-euro-project/">24-month project</a> to investigate the issue, though current ECB President Christine Lagarde has said the launch of such a project would take at least five years.</p><p><em>Other Policy &amp; Regulatory Issues: Antitrust, GDPR</em></p><p>In addition to finance-specific considerations, there are a number of other regulatory (and political) areas shaping the business environment in the EU and France. The EU has long had a more robust posture on antitrust than the US has, particularly when it comes to foreign entities doing business in the EU. This can be seen in actions against &#8220;big tech&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/eu-court-upholds-eu-antitrust-ruling-against-google-2021-11-10/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/04/business/facebook-eu-uk-antitrust.html">Facebook</a>, and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/microsoft-activision-eu-showdown-video-game/">Microsoft</a>.

A deep-dive on GDPR is beyond the scope of this post, as the regulation is expansive, complicated, and can result in fines running into the tens of millions of euros for non-compliance (Google has been <a href="https://www.huntonprivacyblog.com/2020/12/14/cnil-fines-google-and-amazon-135-million-euros-for-alleged-cookie-violations/">fined at least &#8364;100 million</a> for violation of French rules on tracking cookies, for example) .

The lack of consumer credit in France leaves a big gap between day-to-day purchases and the higher end business loan or mortgage. Younited Credit fills that gap for midsize personal loans for anything ranging from a car purchase or home renovations. They offer lines of credit as low as &#8364;1K and max out at &#8364;50K with 8 options for the payback period (6 - 74 months). Their USP is speed and transparency. You might compare them to a Prosper or Lending Club in the US <em>(before LC shuts its retail investor platform, anyway)</em>.</p><p><strong>Spendesk: the Expensify of France</strong></p><p>Spendesk is the all-in-one expense management app for finance teams. If you've ever worked at an SME, you understand the pain associated with provisioning corporate cards, tracking budget and handling expense reports. Spendesk furnishes virtual cards, expense management tooling and workflows for approvals and reporting. A close cousin in the US would be Expensify.</p><p><strong>Qonto: The Bank Novo of France</strong></p><p>Qonto is the all-in-one business account for SMEs and freelancers. The French fintech darling recently raised a &#8364;486M Series D, valuing them at &#8364;4.4B with the goal of reaching 1M SME customers by 2025. In a growing European startup ecosystem, demand for simple and intuitive products to power your business is skyrocketing. Qonto offers services ranging from creating your business, automated bookkeeping, expense management and more. Bank Novo is a close analog in the US, with Brex and Ramp falling within a similar category.</p><p><strong>Lydia: The Venmo of France</strong></p><p>Lydia is the leading P2P mobile payments app of France (and soon-to-be Europe). In the US you might ask someone to <em>Venmo</em> you; in France Lydia has become a verb as well. They've recently rolled out premium plans with current accounts and additional services (<a href="https://lydia-app.com/products/plans">Lydia Blue &amp; Black</a>) and have ambitions to become <em>the</em> financial super app of Europe.</p><p>Unlike Venmo or Cash App, Lydia remains independent (the US counterparts are divisions of PayPal and Square, now Block, respectively). In December of 2021, shortly after announcing stock and crypto trading functionality, Lydia raised a $100M Series C, cementing unicorn status.</p><p><strong>Nalo: the M1 Finance of France</strong></p><p>Nalo is a digital broker for the Assurance Vie investment vehicle we touched on earlier. With a minimum &#8364;1K investment, you can easily navigate various curated funds to invest your nest egg. Think of it like a verticalized Fidelity with hints of digital-native robo-advisors like M1 Finance, Betterment or Wealthfront.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Epsor: The Blooom of France</strong></p><p>Epsor is a savings and retirement application for salaried employees. In the US, offering a 401K plan can be costly and complex for a small business. This problem isn't unique to American entrepreneurs. Epsor combines algorithmic and human-centric advisory services to structure a savings and retirement plan (as a benefit or perk) for their customers' employees. The funds they offer lean towards the eco-responsible and they supply additional services and consulting to ensure individual needs are met. Blooom, a US company, offers a similar service with 401K and IRA management for small businesses.</p><h2>Other Good Reads</h2><p>The Problem with Google Pay (<strong><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronshevlin/2022/01/25/the-problem-with-google-pay/">Ron Shevlin/Forbes</a></strong>)</p><p>Fintech Enters the Era of Distribution (<strong><a href="https://newsletter.fintechtakes.com/p/era-of-distribution">Fintech Takes</a></strong>)</p><p>If you were to build fintech products in an emerging market, would you build it on top of traditional rails or crypto rails?

As last week&#8217;s <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/money-and-payments-discussion-paper.htm">report on CBDCs</a> from the Federal Reserve put it:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Commercial bank money has very little credit or liquidity risk due to federal deposit insurance, the supervision and regulation of commercial banks, and commercial banks' access to central bank liquidity.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Today, a user can be equally confident that their money is secure, <strong>whether held at Varo</strong> (a very small, unprofitable bank), <strong>Chime</strong> (not a bank at all, but with consumer deposits held at FDIC-insured partner banks), or <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>, the largest bank in the country.</p><p>Can you imagine if, when selecting a bank, consumers had to analyze the institution&#8217;s balance sheet and gauge the relative strength or riskiness of the bank&#8217;s assets vs. liabilities?</p><p>In practice, when storing funds in stablecoins, consumers are making a (probably ill-informed) bet on the stablecoin issuer to manage the safety and soundness of the currency by responsibly managing the assets backing it.

As such, when deciding which financial service to use, they&#8217;re understandably much more concerned with the fees, how quickly they can get access to their money, and how the service can help them make every dollar they earn go as far as possible. Given the above, <strong>FDIC insurance almost never comes up, and if it does, it&#8217;s at the bottom of their list</strong>.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>The basic argument Eco is making here is that lower-income users are more worried about keeping the money they have (avoiding fees) than deposit insurance. </p><p>While it is certainly true that this customer segment is cost-sensitive, it is disingenuous to compare &#8220;fees&#8221; to &#8220;FDIC insurance&#8221; in a preference stack ranking.</p><p>New entrants to the financial system benefit from users&#8217; assumption of safety and stability &#8212; an assumption built over decades from prudential regulation and, yes, deposit insurance.</p><p>Users are unlikely to rank FDIC insurance highly as a feature, because they may take for granted the safety and soundness of the traditional banking system that flows from it &#8212; and incorrectly assume that the same types of regulations apply to novel crypto-powered platforms.</p><p>Eco also potentially misleads by <strong>comparing itself to Cash App</strong>, pointing out that funds in the popular peer-to-peer payment app are uninsured.</p><p>The risk of storing funds in Cash App and the risk of storing funds via Eco are not the same. Were Cash App parent company Block to fail, users would become unsecured creditors, and, indeed, might not get all of their money back. That would be bad.</p><p>Users of Eco are similarly positioned. Were it (or its third-party custodians) to fail, Eco users may not get all their funds back.</p><p>But there is another risk; Eco converts users&#8217; USD deposits into a USDC stablecoin. Users also take the risk, knowingly or not, that USDC could deviate from its peg to the dollar, a fact buried in the <a href="https://www.eco.com/terms-conditions">terms and conditions</a> (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;</strong>Account balances held on the Eco Platform through Eco or directly or Third Party Services are held in USDC. While USDC is a &#8220;stablecoin&#8221; designed to remain pegged in value to the U.S. Dollar, and backed by U.S. Dollar reserves, Eco does not control the issuance,&nbsp; redemption or backing of USDC and <strong>cannot guarantee that 1 USDC will always remain redeemable for 1 U.S. Dollar</strong>.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Eco further argues that users with &#8216;only&#8217; $5,000 - $40,000 in their bank account don&#8217;t need deposit insurance, because they still spend the vast majority of each paycheck (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Most in this group still live closer to &#8220;paycheck-to-paycheck&#8221; than you might think. They spend the vast majority (usually at least 80%) of their paycheck every month towards rent, transportation, food, health insurance, and other essentials.</p><p>Their bank balance of &nbsp;$5k-40k sits in their account and doesn&#8217;t change much &#8212; since they aren&#8217;t materially saving or earning interest. We make a point not to push people on moving their whole bank balance to start earning at Eco right away.</p><p>They usually start by using Eco for their monthly &#8220;money-in, money-out,&#8221; like they would have used cash back in the day. And with that volume, <strong>FDIC insurance doesn&#8217;t matter for them because it&#8217;s a relatively low dollar figure</strong>.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>I guess the argument here is that, at any given time, there isn&#8217;t a large amount of money in the account, and thus it doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s insured or not?</p><p>But that is the wrong lens by which to consider the question. It isn&#8217;t about the absolute money held in the account, but rather <strong>the impact on a user if these funds were lost</strong>.</p><p>If an Eco user is &#8220;paycheck to paycheck&#8221; and lost all of the funds they held with Eco, <strong>that loss would be significant, even if it&#8217;s a low absolute number</strong>.</p><p>If you only have $100 bucks that you need to pay rent, transport, food, or health insurance, and you lose it, it&#8217;s going to hurt, whether or not it&#8217;s a &#8220;relatively low dollar figure.&#8221;</p><p>The third category Eco argues doesn&#8217;t need to worry about deposit insurance are those &#8216;aggressively invested&#8217; in the market (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;These people are already <strong>choosing to skip out on FDIC insurance</strong> in favor of trying to have their money work for them. They usually have as little in their checking accounts as possible. So the question never even comes up!&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>This could be a misleading comparison. Users who deploy capital by buying stocks, bonds, or crypto aren&#8217;t &#8220;skipping out&#8221; on FDIC insurance. They&#8217;re making an investment, with hopes of earning a return in exchange for the risk they&#8217;re taking on.</p><p>In investing parlance, cash (or cash equivalents) is referred to as a &#8220;risk free&#8221; asset. The yield of US 10 year Treasuries is typically referred to as the risk free rate of return, because the likelihood of losing principal is essentially zero.</p><p>Conflating making a risk-bearing investment in search of earning a return with &#8220;choosing to skip out&#8221; on deposit insurance is a misleading comparison at best.</p><p>Finally, Eco rebuts the usefulness of deposit insurance for affluent users, who may hold in cash in excess of the $250,000 eligible for deposit insurance. Eco&#8217;s case to this audience is (emphasis added): </p><blockquote><p>&#8220;When we ask them &#8216;why are you comfortable keeping so much money in your brokerage and in bank accounts where the majority of the balance isn&#8217;t insured,&#8217; their response more often than not is simple: <strong>&#8216;if my banks go down, we have bigger problems.&#8217;</strong>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>This line of reasoning ignores the role deposit insurance plays in protecting the system in aggregate.</p><p>While a user holding $1,000,000 at Chase doesn&#8217;t directly benefit from deposit insurance coverage on $750,000 of that balance, the existence of deposit insurance (and the prudential regulation that goes along with it), regulates the amount of risk Chase can take on and, by fostering confidence in the banking system as a whole, protects it writ large.</p><p>The depositor with $1,000,000 balance is still benefiting <em>indirectly</em> from the systemic stability deposit insurance and regulation promote, even if a portion of their funds are uninsured.</p><h4>No Mention of Security Risks</h4><p>While Eco&#8217;s blog post goes to great lengths to convince users they don&#8217;t need deposit insurance, it&#8217;s silent on other risks that are fairly common in crypto <em>(see Crypto.com story below)</em> &#8212; including security breaches and hacks &#8212; though its terms and conditions spell out that such losses are ultimately borne by users (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;</strong>When you hold a balance in your Account, the applicable funds are held by a Third Party Provider.&nbsp; If such Third Party Provider suffers a security breach or other loss, <strong>you may suffer a loss of some or all of your Account balance.</strong>&#8221;</p></blockquote><h4>Products at the Intersection of Crypto and TradFi Will Benefit From the Clarity Well-Crafted Regulation Can Provide</h4><p>It&#8217;s a cliche at this point to say that crypto is &#8220;the wild west.&#8221; And while it&#8217;s inaccurate to say companies like Eco are &#8216;unregulated&#8217; &#8212; Eco holds MSB licenses and must adhere to KYC/AML regulations, for example &#8212; consumer-facing crypto lacks any crypto-<em>specific</em> regulatory framework.</p><p>Presumably, consumer protections, namely UDAAP, apply to companies offering products like Eco&#8217;s. But fundamental questions remain unanswered. Questions like:</p><p><strong>What should these accounts be called?</strong> They&#8217;re not &#8220;bank&#8221; accounts. How should they be categorized, so as to avoid consumer confusion about what the underlying entity is and the protections it does (or doesn&#8217;t) offer?</p><p>This seems like something the team at Eco was cognizant of and struggled with; it defines the product in opposition to TradFi (&#8220;not a bank,&#8221; &#8220;not a checking account,&#8221;) but <strong>without ever saying what the product is!</strong> </p><p>To be fair, fintech suffers the same problem; Chime, which is not a bank, got in trouble with regulators for calling itself a bank.

credit bureaus in the US, is planning to <strong>launch a specialty bureau for buy now, pay later</strong> tradeline data.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.paymentsdive.com/news/experian-debuting-bnpl-bureau-later-this-year/617379/">Payments Dive</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Experian said the specialty bureau, debuting in the first half of the year, will offer &#8220;a comprehensive view of consumer payments, including the number of outstanding BNPL loans, total BNPL loan amounts and BNPL payment status,&#8221;&nbsp;per the release.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>The specialty bureau approach <strong>differs from competitor Equifax</strong>, the first of the big three to announce its intention to enable BNPL providers to furnish data on pay-in-four products. Instead, Equifax has said it will use newly created classifications for the short-term financing products, but, by all indications, that data would reside in Equifax&#8217;s primary data stores.</p><p>Experian said it is choosing to create a distinct store for pay-in-four data to <strong>&#8220;protect consumer credit scores from negative impact.&#8221;</strong> Again from Payments Dive (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Experian will store BNPL data separately, given that preliminary research shows that <strong>including all BNPL account information &#8220;can negatively impact consumer credit scores</strong> because of the way inquiries, new tradelines and utilization rates are reflected in credit score models,&#8221; Greg Wright,&nbsp;executive vice president and chief product officer for Experian, said in an email.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>This notably differs from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-to-add-more-buy-now-pay-later-plans-to-credit-reports-11639915203">Equifax&#8217;s analysis</a>, which suggested some users could see a boost of up to 21 points to their FICO scores from inclusion of BNPL tradelines.</p><p>Secondary bureaus for specific types of products or credit data aren&#8217;t uncommon. Specialty bureaus for tracking data on payday loan usage have long existed &#8212; services like Clarity (acquired by Experian), DataX (acquired by Equifax), FactorTrust (acquired by TransUnion), MicroBilt, and TeleTrack.</p><p>How individual bureaus choose to incorporate data from BNPL providers may impact how a consumer&#8217;s score is calculated &#8212; a user&#8217;s score as derived from Equifax data, including BNPL products, is likely to be different (in either direction), than a score derived from Experian, that excludes BNPL tradeline data.</p><p>Consumers don&#8217;t have a choice of which bureau is checked when they apply for credit (and, in fact, many lenders pull data from more than one.) Such disparate treatment of how BNPL data is handled, and resulting discrepancies in credit reports and scores, is likely to drive consumer confusion and complaints.</p><h2>$34 Million Vanishes, but Crypto.com CEO Says &#8220;No Loss of Customer Funds&#8221;</h2><p>Cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com suffered a hack last week that led to the unauthorized withdrawal of approximately $34 million worth of bitcoin, ethereum, and other currencies.

Credit Reporting May Change That.</h2><p>As use of buy now, pay later products has exploded in the past couple of years, so has scrutiny of the category. It has drawn attention from <a href="https://fintechbusinessweekly.substack.com/p/testify-now-regulate-later-bnpl-goes">legislators</a>, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/cfpb-opens-inquiry-into-buy-now-pay-3175406/">regulators</a>, and <a href="https://www.responsiblelending.org/media/crl-commends-consumer-financial-protection-bureau-starting-inquiry-buy-now-pay-later-credit">consumer advocates</a>, who argue the products may cause consumers to become over indebted, lack the purchase protections of credit cards, and don&#8217;t have adequate disclosures.</p><p>Things are moving quickly in the sector. Equifax recently announced it would support furnishing of BNPL pay-in-4 plans, with Experian and TransUnion appearing to follow suit. And the CFPB opened an inquiry into the sector, requesting information from the major BNPL players in the US: <strong>Affirm, Afterpay</strong> (acquired by Square), <strong>Klarna, PayPal, and Zip</strong> (acquired Quadpay).</p><p>The CFPB&#8217;s <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_bnpl_sample-order_2021-12.pdf">market monitoring questionnaire</a> for BNPL providers should yield an interesting data set, as it includes questions on <strong>repeat usage, loan size, repayment method, underwriting process</strong>, among other proprietary data points.</p><p>While we&#8217;re waiting for the output of the CFPB&#8217;s inquiry, we can look to an already-public data source to get a better understanding of what&#8217;s happening in the sector: <strong>CFPB complaint data</strong>.</p><p><em>Caveat: there are some significant gaps, shortcomings, and biases in CFPB complaint data, so please take the following with a grain of salt.</em></p><h4>Complaints on Buy Now, Pay Later Are Minimal But Growing</h4><p>Firstly, for frame of reference, from January 2019 to January 2022, the CFPB receive approximately <strong>1.2 million consumer complaints</strong>. It&#8217;s difficult to know exactly how many of those relate to buy now, pay later products, as the CFPB <strong>doesn&#8217;t include BNPL as a possible product categorization</strong>.</p><p>However, looking at the largest BNPL-focused companies in the US, there were just 607 complaints from 1/2019 to present &#8212; or <strong>about 0.05% of total complaints</strong> <em>(all complaints data in this post excludes PayPal, as it is difficult to segment which PayPal complaints were driven by BNPL vs. other products.)</em></p><p>But the number of complaints about BNPL has grown substantially over time &#8212; from approximately 0 per month in 2019 and most of 2020 to ~80 per month by the end of 2021:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F245e70d6-a6d9-44bd-828b-6a577937beed_702x434.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F245e70d6-a6d9-44bd-828b-6a577937beed_702x434.png" width="702" height="434" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/245e70d6-a6d9-44bd-828b-6a577937beed_702x434.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:434,&quot;width&quot;:702,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:26421,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F245e70d6-a6d9-44bd-828b-6a577937beed_702x434.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F245e70d6-a6d9-44bd-828b-6a577937beed_702x434.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F245e70d6-a6d9-44bd-828b-6a577937beed_702x434.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F245e70d6-a6d9-44bd-828b-6a577937beed_702x434.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>This still represents <strong>a tiny fraction of overall consumer complaints</strong>.

The bank will also scrap a $12 charge it assessed when it automatically transferred funds between linked accounts (eg, checking/savings) to prevent a user from overdrafting.</p><p>Bank of America president of retail banking Holly O&#8217;Neil said (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Eliminating overdraft altogether <strong>is not really what clients want</strong>. If you take the fee to zero, it is going to be very hard for banks to allow clients even that occasional access.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>For its part, Wells Fargo will also eliminate non-sufficient funds fees, drop a $12 overdraft protection charge, and begin giving customers who overdraw 24 hours to bring their balances above $0 before assessing a fee. Like most all neobanks and some establishment banks like Capital One, Wells Fargo will begin making users&#8217; direct deposits available up to two days early.</p><p>Wells Fargo&#8217;s overdraft fee, however, remains $35 per item.</p><p>Bank of America and Wells Fargo&#8217;s moves to trim fees and help users avoid overdrafts seem primarily designed to placate regulators, rather than a response to competitive pressure from challenger banks. While their policy tweaks will reduce overdraft and NSF fees, which are disproportionately paid by low-income consumers, I would be surprised if new fees don&#8217;t pop up to replace them.</p><h2>Cash App Adds Bitcoin Lightning Network Support, Launches Cash App Taxes</h2><p>The engineers at Cash App have been busy.

Lightning is a level two (&#8220;L2&#8221;) protocol that works in conjunction with the Bitcoin blockchain. Lightning solves some of the issues that have blocked bitcoin payments use cases &#8212; namely, <strong>speed and cost.</strong> Transacting in bitcoin can be slow and expensive.</p><p>The Lightning Network solves that by functioning similarly to card networks in the fiat world. The Lightning protocol can verify the existence of and hold a set amount of bitcoin (authorization) and then record transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain in batches (settlement). This allows Lightning to &#8220;instantly&#8221; process transactions while incurring lower transaction costs.</p><p>The move is potentially significant for Cash App as it could unlock an alternate method for moving value into/out of Cash App wallets or between Cash App users and users of other Lightning-enabled wallets.

So Why Are Some Companies Getting Blocked From Opening New Accounts?</h2><p>If you&#8217;re a follower of fintech news, you no doubt noticed this trend: the LatAm fintech scene is on fire. The number and value of deals has risen considerably in recent years, reaching a high of <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/reports/CB-Insights_Fintech-Report-Q3-2021.pdf">~$6 billion across 76 deals</a> in Q2 2021.</p><p>The improving access to funding has given rise to a robust fintech ecosystem. The two countries anchoring the fintech revolution in LatAm?</p><p><strong>Brazil</strong>, with a population of over 200 million and GDP of USD $1.4 trillion &#8212; but where 30% of the population over 15 lacks access to a bank account, and a credit-to-GDP ratio of 70%.</p><p><strong>And Mexico</strong>, with a population of about 130 million and GDP of USD $1 trillion &#8212; but where an astounding ~63% of the population over 15 lacks access to a bank account (2017), and access to credit is limited, reflected in a credit-to-GDP ratio of just ~39% <em>(I&#8217;ve written about some of the underlying reasons why previously <a href="https://fintechbusinessweekly.substack.com/p/why-credit-card-rates-can-hit-151">here</a>.)</em></p><p>For frame of reference, ~95% of US households have access to a bank account, and <strong>the credit-to-GDP ratio in the US is 216%</strong>.</p><p>With VC funding plentiful and private market valuations in the US reaching stratospheric heights in recent years, investors have increasingly been willing to venture beyond the confines of their Sand Hill Road offices and invest in emerging markets in LatAm.</p><p>The result?

The government has continued to be forward-looking in designing policy initiatives to promote innovation and with it, hopefully, improved access and inclusion in the country.</p><p>For example, in just the past few weeks, the central bank, Banxico, has announced plans to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/30/mexico-plans-to-issue-a-cbdc-by-2024-government-confirms/">launch a central bank digital currency</a> (CBDC) by 2024 and a CreditKarma-like <a href="https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/sectorfinanciero/Banxico-desarrolla-app-para-que-usuarios-reciban-ofertas-de-credito-personalizadas-20220103-0086.html">API-driven credit marketplace</a>.</p><h4><strong>What is the &#8220;Fintech Law,&#8221; Why Was It Passed?</strong></h4><p>Fintech activity in Mexico pre-dates the Fintech Law. In addition to addressing activities and business models that fit poorly in the existing regulatory framework, goals of the Fintech Law <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/mx/Documents/legal/2018/Fintech-Law-Decree.pdf">include to</a>:</p><ul><li><p>promote financial inclusion</p></li><li><p>provide legal security to technological financial services users</p></li><li><p>trigger greater competition in the financial services market</p></li><li><p>increase the number of participants in the financial sector</p></li><li><p>prevent money laundering activities through electronic means</p></li><li><p>regulate the transactions with digital assets in Mexico</p></li></ul><p>Despite its all-encompassing sounding name, the law as passed in 2018 addresses a relatively narrow slice of &#8220;fintech.&#8221;</p><h4>Financial Technology Institutions: Crowdfunding &amp; e-Money</h4><p>The Fintech Law defines licenses for just two types of Financial Technology Institutions (FTIs): crowdfunding institutions (IFCs) and electronic payment funds institutions aka &#8220;e-money institutions&#8221; (IFPEs).</p><p>Under the Fintech Law, crowdfunding business are permitted to:</p><ul><li><p>Facilitate collective debt financing (eg, peer-to-peer lending model, comparable to Prosper in the US)</p></li><li><p>Facilitate collective equity financing (eg, crowdfunded equity model, comparable to WeFunder in the US)</p></li><li><p>Facilitate collective financing of co-ownership or royalties (eg, fractional real-estate investing, comparable to Fundrise in the US)</p></li></ul><p>And e-money institutions are permitted to issue, administer, redeem, and transmit electronic payment funds via computer applications, webpage, and other digital platforms (eg, digital wallet and neobank platforms, comparable to Venmo, Cash App, and Chime in the US).</p><p>Although IFCs (crowdfunding) and IFPEs (e-money) are the only two <em>licensing</em> categories the Fintech Law defines, the legislation does speak to other areas of fintech in Mexico, including <strong><a href="https://www.natlawreview.com/article/new-open-banking-regulation-mexico">open banking</a> and <a href="https://scalablesolutions.io/news/mexico-digital-asset-adoption-and-regulatory-framework/">digital assets</a></strong>, and creates a &#8220;regulatory sandbox&#8221; to help promote innovation.</p><p>Implementing the Fintech Law has been an ongoing process, with relevant agencies in the country <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/secondary-fintech-regulations-related-5984828/">continuing</a> <a href="https://latambridge.com/en/2021/04/28/mexico-the-mexican-fintech-ecosystem/">to develop</a> regulations that implement that law.</p><h4><strong>What Is the &#8220;8th Transitory Provision,&#8221; and Why Is It Important?</strong></h4><p>When the Fintech Law went into effect in March 2018, numerous businesses were already engaged in activities that would fall under the new crowdfunding and e-money institution categories of the law.</p><p>Recognizing this, the Fintech Law included a provision &#8212; the &#8220;8th transitory provision&#8221; &#8212; to permit those companies to continue operating while seeking licensure under the new law. In March 2021, there were approximately 70 fintechs operating under the transitory provision while seeking full authorization &#8212; including some fintechs providing Banking-as-a-Service infrastructure used to enable <em>other</em> companies&#8217; products and services.</p><p>In October 2021, a number of already-operating fintechs <strong>had their authorizations denied</strong> &#8212; causing headaches for those companies, but also impacting operations for 3rd party fintechs that had built products on top of their services.</p><p>There were some additional regulatory actions, not directly related to the Fintech Law, that have caused disruption in the sector.</p><p>A quick overview of some of these developments and their impact:</p><h4><strong>Accendo Bank</strong></h4><p>Accendo Bank was a small, fully licensed bank &#8212; it was not operating under the Fintech law. The <a href="https://www.elsoldemexico.com.mx/finanzas/cnbv-retira-licencia-para-operar-a-banco-accendo-7270645.html">tiny bank</a> had a portfolio worth just MXN $2.154 billion, or about USD $105 million, comprising <a href="https://www.fitchratings.com/research/banks/accendo-banco-liquidation-not-systemic-risk-for-mexican-banking-system-30-09-2021">0.08% of assets and 0.09% of deposits</a> in the Mexican banking sector.</p><p>However, not unlike smaller American banks that provide banking services to non-bank fintechs, Accendo positioned itself as &#8220;the fintech bank&#8221; and pursued a Banking-as-a-Service driven business model.</p><p>Accendo had <a href="https://expansion.mx/economia/2021/09/28/accendo-banco-pierde-licencia-hacienda">relationships</a> with a number of well-known fintechs, including <strong>Rappi, Cuenca, Billpocket, Kushki, Sr. Pago, Claro, Okcredito</strong>, among others.</p><p>In September 2021, Accendo Bank <a href="https://www.elsoldemexico.com.mx/finanzas/cnbv-retira-licencia-para-operar-a-banco-accendo-7270645.html">had its licensed revoked</a> by the CNBV, after its capitalization index, a measure of its ability to withstand financial stress, fell to 9.88% vs. the required minimum of 10.5%. Although Accendo had a brief window to secure an outside capital injection, it failed to do so, leading to its license revocation and, ultimately, liquidation.</p><p>Rappi, the largest company leveraging Accendo&#8217;s BaaS functionality, said disruption from the bank&#8217;s failure <a href="https://expansion.mx/economia/2021/09/29/esto-pasara-con-las-alianzas-comerciales-de-accendo-banco">would be minimal</a>, with just <strong>1.2% of its cardholders in Mexico unable to use their cards &#8220;for a short period.&#8221;</strong> Visa, the payment network for cards issued by Accendo on behalf of fintechs, said it would work with the impacted parties to take the steps necessary to resolve any disruptions from Accendo&#8217;s failure.</p><h4><strong>Cacao PayCard</strong></h4><p>Cacao PayCard, founded in 2017, is a payment processing company that provides infrastructure for other fintechs to issue and operate debit cards (roughly analogous to Marqeta or Galileo in the US). Cacao boasted a number of well-known Mexican fintechs as clients, including <strong>BNEXT, Clip, Jefa, Kapital, Lana, Meta, Oyster, Tauros, and Warp</strong>.</p><p>Cacao, whose business pre-dated passage of the Fintech Law, had continued operating under the eight transitory provision as it sought full authorization under the new law.</p><p>However, Cacao&#8217;s application for <a href="https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/amp/sectorfinanciero/Comienzan-a-negarse-autorizaciones-respecto-a-la-Ley-Fintech-20211003-0026.html">authorization was denied</a> in October 2021 &#8212; requiring fintechs dependent on its infrastructure to halt new user registrations:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6605230-302d-44c0-ac35-a984cb44e28b_600x376.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6605230-302d-44c0-ac35-a984cb44e28b_600x376.png" width="600" height="376" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d6605230-302d-44c0-ac35-a984cb44e28b_600x376.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:376,&quot;width&quot;:600,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:108777,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6605230-302d-44c0-ac35-a984cb44e28b_600x376.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6605230-302d-44c0-ac35-a984cb44e28b_600x376.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6605230-302d-44c0-ac35-a984cb44e28b_600x376.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6605230-302d-44c0-ac35-a984cb44e28b_600x376.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Image: Screen cap of Bnext website 01/08/2022, text via Google Translate</figcaption></figure></div><p>In early December, Brazilian payment processor Dock <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/visa-backed-fintech-in-brazil-buys-mexican-card-processor-cacao">announced</a> it would acquire Cacao PayCard for an undisclosed sum. Cacao PayCard is Dock&#8217;s third acquisition outside of Brazil; it has previously acquired fintech infrastructure companies <strong>Muxi and BPP Instituicao de Pagamento SA</strong>.</p><p>Presumably the intention is for Visa-backed Dock to secure the authorization Cacao was denied and leverage Cacao&#8217;s clients it is able to retain as it stitches together a pan-LatAm payment processing platform.</p><h4><strong>Flink</strong></h4><p>Cacao PayCard was hardly the only Mexican fintech that had been operating under the temporary provisions of the eight transitory article and was subsequently denied full authorization.</p><p>Flink offers a mobile banking app targeted at millennials and Gen Z, with budgeting, savings goal-setting, and debit card. In 2020, it added stock trading services &#8212; and, in August 2021, <a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2021/08/mexican-fintech-flink-lands-57m-in-series-b-round/">announced</a> it had raised a $57 million Series B from marquee investors like <strong>Lightspeed Venture Partners and Accel</strong>.</p><p>But come October 2021, Flink&#8217;s application for full authorization under the Fintech Law <a href="https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/sectorfinanciero/Continuan-autorizaciones-fintech-tambien-rechazos-20211010-0039.html">was denied</a>. The denial has forced Flink to no longer offer core features of its app to new customers, with <a href="https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/sectorfinanciero/Continuan-autorizaciones-fintech-tambien-rechazos-20211010-0039.html">its website</a> stating (via Google Translate):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;In compliance with the regulation and due to the refusal by the financial authorities to request authorization for Flink, SAPI de CV (&#8220;Flink&#8221;) to operate as an Electronic Payment Fund Institution, it has stopped providing its services of &#8216;wallet&#8217; for the celebration of new operations related to those attributed to said institutions.&#8221;</p></blockquote><h4><strong>UnDosTres</strong></h4><p>UnDosTres, founded by a veteran of Indian fintech Paytm, is <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/mexico-payment-apps-india/">somewhat of a super app</a>, centered around a digital a wallet and enabling users to pay utility bills, top up mobile phones, shop at popular merchants, and even buy movie tickets.</p><p>UnDosTres also <strong>provided the underlying infrastructure for the Argentine neobank Ual&#225;</strong> to launch in Mexico in September 2020. The move was a calculated risk for Ual&#225;: it could have sought its own license under Mexico&#8217;s Fintech Law, but UnDosTres was already operating under the eight transitory article while it sought full authorization. </p><p>Partnering with UnDosTres provided a faster route to launch in the Mexican market. Ual&#225; founder Pierpaolo Barbieri <a href="https://elceo.com/tecnologia/uala-fintech-argentina-llega-al-mercado-mexicano-con-ayuda-de-la-mexicana-undostres/">said at the time</a> (via Google Translate):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;All the IFTs that existed before the passage of the law are in a normalization process, but no new ones have been registered. So we use a supplier such as UnDosTres to be able to reach the market and it will not be the only regulatory development that we are betting on to make a product in Mexico.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Having multiple regulatory strategies was good hedging on Ual&#225;&#8217;s part. In October 2021, UnDosTres had its license application denied &#8212; <a href="https://iupana.com/2021/10/13/niegan-autorizacion-a-wallet-que-da-servicios-a-uala-mexico/">blocking Ual&#225;</a> from onboarding new users through the partnership.</p><p>Less than a month later, news broke that Ual&#225; <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-03/argentine-fintech-uala-buys-mexican-bank-abc-capital">reached an agreement</a> to buy Mexican bank ABC Capital SA for an undisclosed sum. The transaction is subject to approval from Mexican banking regulators, though Ual&#225; appears to already be <a href="https://www.uala-abc.com.mx/">opening new accounts</a> through ABC Capital.</p><h4><strong>Fondeadora</strong></h4><p>Fondeadora, which began as a crowdfunding platform <a href="https://www.excelsior.com.mx/hacker/2016/11/16/1128463">similar to Kickstarter</a>, has since pivoted to the mission of building a full stack neobank. The startup has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/mexican-challenger-bank-fondeadora-adds-14-million-to-its-series-b/">raised $28 million</a>, including from <strong>Gradient Ventures, Google&#8217;s AI-focused venture fund, and Y Combinator</strong>.</p><p>But the startup has also faced regulatory woes. Fondeadora&#8217;s issues stem not from the Fintech Law, but from partnerships with SOFIPOs (licensed microcredit institutions) it leveraged to open accounts on behalf of its users.</p><p>The CNBV, Mexico&#8217;s primary banking regulator, fined the company MXN $844,900 for remotely opening accounts through SOFIPOs without the CNBV&#8217;s authorization. In May 2021 <a href="https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/sectorfinanciero/CNBV-multa-a-fintech-abrio-cuentas-sin-autorizacion-20210506-0109.html">El Economista</a> reported (via Google Translate):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;According to the CNBV portal, this sanction was for violating the Popular Savings and Credit Law, since Fondeadora collected data and information, and also made the identification of clients of a popular financial company (sofipo), for the remote opening of deposit accounts, without having an authorization from the authority.</p><p>Sources aware of the sanctions process, commented that in the alliance that this platform has with some sofipos, this act was detected that violated article 124 of the Popular Savings and Credit Law.</p><p>&#8220;Fondeadora, through its proprietary platform or application, collected data and information and made the identification of clients or potential clients, for the non-face-to-face opening of deposit accounts, without the latter having obtained prior approval from the Commission&#8221;, It can be read on the sanctions portal of the regulatory body.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>According to the company, the sanction was for a limited set of activities, and the company had already <a href="https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/sectorfinanciero/La-CNBV-actua-de-forma-estricta-para-proteger-a-usuarios-20210511-0114.html">begun a new partnership</a> with Apoyo M&#250;ltiple in order to continue operating.</p><p>Fondeadora co-founder Ren&#233; Serrano <a href="https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/sectorfinanciero/La-CNBV-actua-de-forma-estricta-para-proteger-a-usuarios-20210511-0114.html">stated</a> (via Google Translate):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Mexico comes from very difficult issues in terms of bank protection, after the great crises, where your savings were lost, suddenly the banks went bankrupt and you had no one to complain to ... That the CNBV is strict with new fintech players has to do with that legacy. Obviously there are things to improve, but the main concern must be the protection of the user.&#8221;</p></blockquote><h4>Despite a Dedicated &#8220;Fintech Law,&#8221; It Hasn&#8217;t Been Smooth Sailing for Mexican Startups</h4><p>Mexican fintechs operating neobank- and BaaS-like models aren&#8217;t the only companies that have run into regulatory trouble. Companies operating under the crowdfunding provision like <strong>Propeler, Cumplo, and Inverspot</strong> have also had their applications for full authorization declined by the CNBV.</p><p>That isn&#8217;t to say Mexican banking regulators are refusing all applications. Numerous companies have had <a href="https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/sectorfinanciero/Continuan-autorizaciones-fintech-tambien-rechazos-20211010-0039.html">authorization to operate</a> under the crowdfunding provisions approved, including: <strong>Fundary, Likideo MX, BXL Fintech, Doopla, Prestadero, M2Crowd, Cien Ladrillos, Play Business, and Crowd Up Mex</strong>.</p><p>As have a number of e-money institutions, including: <strong>NVIO Pagos, Trafalgar Digital, BRX Payments, Inguz Digital, BKBN, Tu Dinero Digital, STP Transfer and Payment System, ColtoMoney, Cuenca and Mexpago</strong>.</p><p>Still, I suspect the uncertainty of approval under Mexico&#8217;s Fintech Law &#8212; and the disruption to fintechs relying on services operating under the eight transitory provision that were subsequently denied full authorization &#8212; has had something to do with a number of fintechs acquiring legacy financial firms in Mexico.</p><p>In addition to <strong>Ual&#225;&#8217;s purchase of ABC Capital,</strong> <strong>Credijusto</strong>, a small business lender, <strong><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-credijusto-idUSKCN2DR238">acquired Banco Finterra</a></strong> in June 2021; Brazilian neobank <strong>Nubank <a href="https://www.leadersleague.com/fr/news/nubank-expands-mexico-footprint-with-acquisition-of-local-lender">acquired Akala</a></strong>, a small non-bank lender, in October 2021.</p><h2>Top 0.01% of Bitcoin Owners Hold 27% of the Cryptocurrency</h2><p>This story came out in late December, and seems to have been swallowed by the holiday news cycle (or perhaps I just missed it.)</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w29396">research by the National Bureau of Economic Research</a>, the top 10,000 holders of bitcoin hold approximately 5 million bitcoins, or the equivalent of about $232 billion (well, $208 billion as of this morning &#8212; bitcoin&#8217;s price as slid substantially in recent days.)</p><p>Based on ~114 million holders of bitcoin worldwide, <strong>the top 0.01% of bitcoin holders control about 27% of bitcoins currently in circulation</strong>.

So I thought I&#8217;d try my hand at making some wild predictions on what might happen this year in these rapidly evolving sectors. </p><h4>A run on (or complete collapse of) a stablecoin</h4><p>Stablecoins, though lacking a specific definition, are most often pegged in value to a &#8220;fiat&#8221; currency &#8212; typically, the US dollar, though stablecoins backed by other major currencies, like the Euro or Yen, also exist. You can think of a stablecoin as a representation of a dollar (or Euro, Yen, etc.) on the blockchain.</p><p>There are various approaches to constructing currency-linked stablecoins, but they share a common characteristic: you should always be able to redeem the stablecoin for an equivalent amount of the linked currency.</p><p>Stablecoins form a <strong>lynchpin in the crypto ecosystem</strong> because it&#8217;s quicker to transact and settle trades between, say, bitcoin and a USD-linked stablecoin in the same exchange account, like Coinbase or Binance, than to trade back into <em>actual</em> dollars.</p><p>The size of the stablecoin market has grown incredibly rapidly, <strong>rising 23x from about $5 billion USD to $120 billion USD</strong> from 2020 to 2021 &#8212; the largest of which is Tether, which has approximately $78 billion in circulation.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The prediction:</strong> a currency-linked stablecoin experiences a &#8220;run,&#8221; causing it to break its peg (eg, redeem below par) or collapse altogether (most likely <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-03/tether-gives-more-details-on-assets-backing-crypto-stablecoin">Tether</a>)</p></blockquote><h4>A Major Correction in Established Crypto Prices</h4><p>Crypto prices are notoriously volatile. For many crypto traders and enthusiasts, as they say, that <strong>volatility is feature, not bug</strong>. Whether they&#8217;re chasing adrenaline or out-sized returns, volatility enables a broader array of trading strategies.</p><p>Bitcoin, which started the year around $32,000, reached as high as $67,000 in November, before shedding about 31% of its value to end the year just above $46,000. Other cryptocurrencies have seen even greater volatility, on a percent change basis.</p><p>Innumerable factors could impact established cryptos&#8217; prices in 2022: macro factors, like <strong>inflation and interest rate policies</strong>; increasing scrutiny or crackdowns from regulators; competition from new cryptos offering greater utility; or a &#8216;run&#8217; or collapse of a stablecoin linked to the sector, for example.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"

According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-to-add-more-buy-now-pay-later-plans-to-credit-reports-11639915203">the story</a> (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Early next year, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/EFX">Equifax</a> Inc. <strong>will begin recording installment plans</strong> that allow shoppers to make four biweekly payments instead of covering the full cost at checkout. The move is meant to give lenders a fuller picture of people&#8217;s financial commitments, including how much they owe on these plans.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>However, it <strong>isn&#8217;t Equifax&#8217;s decision</strong> whether or not creditors furnish data to it. In all likelihood, the bit of news here is that Equifax will <em>enable</em> BNPL providers to report data on &#8220;split pay&#8221; financing, should they choose to do so.</p><p>Bureaus have historically categorized accounts as <strong>revolving</strong> (credit cards, charge cards, store brand cards), <strong>installment</strong> (auto loan, student loan, personal loan, etc.), <strong>mortgage</strong>, or other. Further, the bureaus historically have accepted tradeline data from furnishers on a <em>monthly</em> cadence and generally did not accept data for short duration products, like payday loans.</p><p>Thus <strong>updates to bureaus&#8217; technical infrastructure</strong> are required to ingest and process data from BNPL providers, whose products are likely to be considered &#8220;installment loans,&#8221; typically include biweekly payments instead of monthly, and have short durations of only about six weeks.</p><h4>If Buy Now, Pay Later Providers <em>Can</em> Report, <em>Will</em> They?</h4><p>So, although <strong>Equifax</strong> is planning to enable the reporting of split pay plans (and presumably <strong>TransUnion</strong> and <strong>Experian</strong> will follow suit), I have yet to see any provider of split pay financing <strong>announce plans to begin furnishing</strong> this data.</p><p>Sezzle offers a product, <a href="https://my.sezzle.com/sezzle-up/">Sezzle Up</a>, that does report to the bureaus, though it is structured more as a revolving product than the pay-in-4 format typical of split pay offerings.</p><p>As the technical pieces of this are ironed out, <strong>pressure will increase</strong> on BNPL providers to report this data. But, from the companies&#8217; perspective, there are arguments to be made for and against furnishing data on split pay plans.</p><p><strong>Reasons to Begin Reporting</strong></p><p><strong>Pressure from legislators / regulators:</strong> BNPL has already been the <a href="https://fintechbusinessweekly.substack.com/p/testify-now-regulate-later-bnpl-goes">subject of Congressional hearings</a>, including questions around affordability and credit reporting. For its part, the CFPB recently <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-opens-inquiry-into-buy-now-pay-later-credit/">initiated an inquiry</a> into the sector, <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_bnpl_sample-order_2021-12.pdf">including questions</a> on credit underwriting and furnishing.</p><p><strong>Helping users build credit:</strong> part of the narrative around the use case of BNPL is that it enables consumers who may have little credit history to access credit. Furnishing data to the bureaus would allow BNPL providers to position their products as helping their users build a credit history. Whether or not tradeline data on split pay actually improves users&#8217; creditworthiness and scores remains to be seen; users <em>missing</em> payments on BNPL plans would surely see their scores drop.</p><p><strong>Improved underwriting and preventing &#8220;loan stacking&#8221;:</strong> If a majority of BNPL providers begin reporting to bureaus <em>and</em> using bureau data to underwrite, they would gain better visibility into users&#8217; overall ability to pay, and should be able to make better underwriting decisions, resulting in lower credit losses.</p><p><strong>Reasons Not to Begin Reporting</strong></p><p><strong>Pressure to use bureau data to underwrite:</strong> if BNPL providers begin furnishing data to bureaus, no doubt the pressure will increase for them to also use bureau data to <em>underwrite</em> split pay products. Consumer advocates and legislators already argue this would help ensure affordability and prevent users from becoming overly indebted. </p><p>But, for BNPL providers, using bureau data to underwrite could erode a key user value proposition: a near-seamless user experience. Using bureau data would likely require additional user inputs, opt-ins, acknowledgments, and disclosures, potentially lowering conversion rates.</p><p>If BNPL providers began using bureau data to underwrite and furnishing tradeline data back to the bureaus, the products increasingly look like, well, loans, which could weaken the industry&#8217;s argument that the companies aren&#8217;t &#8220;creditors&#8221; under TILA.</p><p><strong>Infrastructure to furnish data to bureaus:</strong> reporting tradeline data to bureaus incurs real costs for creditors &#8212; both directly (lenders must <em>pay</em> the bureaus to send them data) and indirectly (IT, compliance, etc.).</p><p>BNPL providers would need to ensure compliance with FCRA, including building the capability to handle consumer disputes of tradeline data. Given the large number and short duration of transactions, this could generate a large volume of complaints. Reporting tradeline data would also likely increase complaints to the CFPB, which require processes and staff to respond to.</p><h2>Other Good Reads</h2><p>Millions in Minutes&#8202;: The Zoom Boom in Covid Era Startup Fundraising (<strong><a href="https://mattward.io/millions-in-minutes%e2%80%8a-%e2%80%8athe-zoom-boom-in-covid-era-startup-fundraising/">Matt Ward</a></strong>)</p><p>Why bitcoin is worse than a Madoff-style Ponzi scheme (<strong><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/83a14261-598d-4601-87fc-5dde528b33d0">FT</a></strong>)</p><p>Chris Dixon and Packy McCormick on the future of crypto (<strong><a href="https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2021/11/08/chris-dixon-and-packy-mccormick-on-the-future-of-crypto">The Economist</a></strong>)</p><p>Can defi fix lending?

the individual people funding loans on SoLo&#8217;s platform also do not hold lending licenses, which is likely in violation of state law in many of the jurisdictions SoLo operates.</p></li><li><p>SoLo appears to be functioning as a broker, an activity for which it does not hold a license.</p></li><li><p>SoLo appears to be operating as a debt collector, an activity which requires a license in many states.</p></li><li><p>SoLo appears to be <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=15-USC-648284895-644972389&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=title:15:chapter:41:subchapter:III:section:1681a">operating as a consumer reporting agency</a>, by collecting data on loan applicants and computing its proprietary &#8220;SoLo Score,&#8221; which would make it subject to the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/statutes/fair-credit-reporting-act/545a_fair-credit-reporting-act-0918.pdf">Fair Credit Reporting Act</a>.</p></li></ul><h4>So How Did SoLo Get B Corp Certified?</h4><p>By design, the B Corp certification process needs to be generic enough to apply to a wide variety of companies across different industries. The assessment is more geared towards companies that produce physical goods or provide tangible services; it also skews towards larger corporations vs. small companies or startups. </p><p>The evaluation for B Corp certification awards points across five categories: <strong>community, customers, workers, environment, and governance</strong>. Companies need to score a minimum of 80 points in order to be eligible for B Corp certification.</p><p>However, a company can earn points from areas that have <strong>seemingly little to do with the impact of its actual business</strong>, like offering paid family leave, giving employees an ownership stake, recycling, or preferring local suppliers.</p><p>In <a href="https://bcorporation.net/directory/so-lo-funds">SoLo Fund&#8217;s case</a>, it derives just over 1/3 of its 103 points from the &#8220;Customers&#8221; category because it is &#8220;empowering&#8221; and serving underserved populations.</p><p>Combined with points it earns from the Community category for &#8220;economic impact&#8221; and diversity, the Governance category for being &#8220;mission-based,&#8221; and the Workers category, SoLo Funds easily exceeds the 80 point minimum for B Corp certification.</p><h4>Shouldn&#8217;t it take more than points to qualify?</h4><p>The B Corp certification process does go beyond a points rubric; companies seeking the status must also complete a disclosure questionnaire certifying whether they operate in certain industries or have faced certain negative outcomes or penalties.</p><p>In its disclosure form, SoLo Funds claims it is not involved in &#8220;Payday, Short Term, or High Interest Lending&#8221; and that it has not had any formal complaints to regulatory agencies:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27fbfce5-237c-4433-8ae4-afc19a825b8a_661x608.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27fbfce5-237c-4433-8ae4-afc19a825b8a_661x608.png" width="661" height="608" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/27fbfce5-237c-4433-8ae4-afc19a825b8a_661x608.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:608,&quot;width&quot;:661,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:146993,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27fbfce5-237c-4433-8ae4-afc19a825b8a_661x608.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27fbfce5-237c-4433-8ae4-afc19a825b8a_661x608.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27fbfce5-237c-4433-8ae4-afc19a825b8a_661x608.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27fbfce5-237c-4433-8ae4-afc19a825b8a_661x608.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blab-impact-published-production/N4ZYul1Eo3UrbQ9NdKvfCDcCz0P4qJEs">SoLo Funds B Corp Disclosure Form</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>And yet, later <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blab-impact-published-production/N4ZYul1Eo3UrbQ9NdKvfCDcCz0P4qJEs">in the same document</a>, the company describes its business model as offering &#8220;short-term funds&#8221;

Let&#8217;s check in and see how I did!</p><h4>1. Monzo or N26 <strong>exit the American market</strong></h4><p>It may seem obvious now, but, remember, at the end of 2020, Monzo was <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/u-k-challenger-bank-monzo-applies-for-u-s-banking-license">in the process</a> of applying for a US bank charter. In August of 2020, N26 had celebrated its 1-year anniversary of operating in the US by <a href="https://n26.com/en-us/press/press-release/n26-celebrates-one-year-anniversary-with-nearly-500000-customers-in-the-us-market">claiming it had 500,000 users</a>.</p><p>And yet, here we are. Monzo, which has struggled (though recently rebounded) in its home market, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8ea6d977-c2fc-47a8-9d93-1ec02eb4f9a9">withdrew its US bank charter app</a> after being told it was unlikely to succeed. Its US banking product, offered via Sutton Bank, <em>still hasn&#8217;t publicly launched</em> &#8212; and, at this point, my suspicion is it never will.</p><p>For its part, N26 <a href="https://n26.com/en-eu/blog/leaving-the-us-why-and-what-it-means-for-n26">announced a month ago</a> it will wind down its US operations, despite accumulating &#8220;500,000 users&#8221; (independent market research puts the number at closer to 100,000) &#8220;in order to sharpen [their] strategic focus on the important role [they] have to play as a pioneer in digital banking in Europe.&#8221;</p><p>N26 seems to have its work cut out for it in Europe: the German banking regulator BaFin <a href="https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/EN/Massnahmen/60b_KWG_84_WpIG_und_57_GwG/meldung_211109_60b_N26_en.html">has limited</a> the neobank to a maximum of 50,000 new customers per month due to its &#8220;shortcomings in risk management.&#8221;</p><p><strong>Prediction grade: A+</strong></p><h4>2. Apple and Goldman <strong>roll</strong> out an Apple Wallet/Apple Pay-integrated buy now/pay later offering</h4><p>Again, accurate predictions tend to feel obvious in retrospect. In late 2020, the BNPL trend was hitting critical velocity in the US market; PayPal had only just <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2020-08-31-PayPal-Introduces-New-Interest-Free-Buy-Now-Pay-Later-Installment-Solution">launched its split pay</a> offering at the end of August, 2020.</p><p>In July, 2021, news broke that Apple was in fact working with Goldman on a BNPL offering; <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-13/apple-goldman-plan-buy-now-pay-later-service-to-rival-paypal">according to Bloomberg</a> at the time:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Apple Inc. is working on a new service that will let consumers pay for any Apple Pay purchase in installments over time, rivaling the &#8220;buy now, pay later&#8221; offerings popularized by services from Affirm Holdings Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc.</p><p>The upcoming service, known internally as Apple Pay Later, will use Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as the lender for the loans needed for the installment offerings, according to people with knowledge of the matter.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>The pairing made sense &#8212; the two companies already partner on the Apple Card credit card, which includes 0% installment financing for Apple purchases.

U.S. Bank&#8217;s (a top 10 bank by assets) <a href="https://ir.usbank.com/news-releases/news-release-details/us-bancorp-acquire-mufg-union-bank">acquisition of MUFG Union Bank</a>. Regional banks like Citizens, Regions, and M&amp;T made smaller, tuck-in acquisitions to complement their existing businesses. </p><p>The second half of this prediction, fintechs acquiring small banks as a path to a charter, more clearly came to pass in 2021. Early in the year, <a href="https://www.sofi.com/press/sofi-announces-agreement-acquire-golden-pacific-bancorp-inc/">SoFI announced</a> it would buy tiny Golden Pacific Bancorp for just $22.3 million. And just last month, BM Technologies <a href="https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/39217/bm-technologies-agrees-to-buy-a-bank">announced</a> it would buy First Sound Bank in a deal valued at $23 million.</p><p>The fintechs-buying-banks trend held south of the border as well. Mexican small business lender Credijusto <a href="https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/38259/mexican-fintech-credijusto-buys-a-bank">announced in June</a> it would buy Banco Finterra for an undisclosed sum. Argentine fintech Ual&#225; also <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-03/argentine-fintech-uala-buys-mexican-bank-abc-capital">revealed it would buy</a> Mexican bank ABC Capital.</p><p><strong>Prediction grade: B</strong></p><h4>4. Governments evaluate and implement overhauls in how citizens and businesses apply for and receive benefits</h4><p>Perhaps this prediction was more wishful thinking. The pandemic made clear the necessity of being able to move quickly to spin up programs and disburse aid to families and businesses. The existing state and federal systems in place proved ill-equipped to meet the challenge.</p><p>The result? Overloaded state unemployment programs with huge backlogs <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/shows/marketplace-tech/covid-19-state-unemployment-claims-old-coding-language/">desperately looking for COBOL programmers</a>; stimulus payments disbursed via a confusing mix of direct deposits, paper checks, and <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/millions-of-stimulus-payments-were-mailed-as-prepaid-debit-cards-some-say-they-look-like-scams/">scammy-looking prepaid cards</a> &#8212; resulting in some families facing long waits to get their money; and the rushed PPP program, designed to get money to small businesses, 1<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/17/business/ppp-fraud-covid.html">5% of which may have been fraud</a>.</p><p>This prediction was focused on federal and state governments deploying tech to improve the UX of applying for a receiving benefits&#8230; which hasn&#8217;t really happened. The private sector, however, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/08/us/politics/safety-net-apps-tech.html">has developed solutions</a> that solve some pain points for end users, like a portal to simplify the process of applying for benefits in California and the EBT management app <a href="https://www.joinpropel.com/">Propel</a>.</p><p><strong>Prediction grade: C-</strong></p><h2>CFPB Seeks Information from BNPL Sector</h2><p>The CFPB <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-opens-inquiry-into-buy-now-pay-later-credit/">dropped a bomb</a> on buy now, pay later&#8217;s gangbusters holiday season on Thursday. The consumer regulator announced it is opening an inquiry into the sector; it is <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_bnpl_sample-order_2021-12.pdf">seeking information</a> from Affirm, Afterpay, Klarna, PayPal, and Zip. Affirm&#8217;s share price <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/affirm-stock-price-cfpb-announces-buy-now-pay-later-inquiry-2021-12">slid as much as -16%</a> on the news.</p><p>But regulatory moves to take a look at the sector shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise to anyone who is paying attention. Australia and the UK, both countries where BNPL gained traction earlier and faster than in the US, have both <a href="https://asic.gov.au/media/5852803/rep672-published-16-november-2020-2.pdf">initiated</a> <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/dd2f16f3-8b6b-4f08-aca1-88021b54f08c">regulatory reviews</a>.</p><p>In the US, as far back as January 2020, the California DFPI was treating split pay BNPL as a loan and <a href="https://www.paulhastings.com/insights/client-alerts/california-deems-certain-deferred-payment-products-loans-requiring-a-lending-license">requiring providers to obtain licenses</a>; this July, the CFPB <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/should-you-buy-now-and-pay-later/">published a blog post</a> aimed at educating consumers about the category; and the House Committee on Financial Services <a href="https://fintechbusinessweekly.substack.com/p/testify-now-regulate-later-bnpl-goes">held a hearing focusing on BNPL</a> just last month.</p><p>The key areas the CFPB highlights as concerning include the risk of accumulating debt; its <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-opens-inquiry-into-buy-now-pay-later-credit/">release states</a> (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Whereas the old-style layaway installment loans were typically used for the occasional big purchase, people can quickly become regular users of BNPL for everyday discretionary buying, especially if they download the <strong>easy-to-use apps or install the web browser plugins</strong>.</p><p>If a consumer has multiple purchases on multiple schedules with multiple companies, it may be <strong>hard to keep track of when payments are scheduled</strong>. And when there is not enough money in a consumer&#8217;s bank account, this can potentially result in <strong>charges by both the consumer&#8217;s bank and the BNPL provider</strong>. Because of the ease of getting these loans, consumers can end up <strong>spending more than anticipated</strong>.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>The CFPB&#8217;s statement also highlights concerns about &#8220;regulatory arbitrage.&#8221; Split pay-style products are commonly formulated as a payment at the time of purchase and three subsequent payments, typically spread two weeks apart. Because there is no interest/finance charge and fewer than five payments, BNPL providers <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1602">aren&#8217;t defined as creditors under TILA</a>, which, they argue, exempts them from certain disclosures.</p><p>Per the CFPB&#8217;s statement (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Some BNPL companies may not be adequately evaluating what consumer protection laws apply to their products. For example, <strong>some BNPL products do not provide certain disclosures, which could be required by some laws</strong>.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Finally, the CFPB flags the risk of what it terms &#8220;data harvesting.&#8221; It correctly flags the trend of downward pressure on merchant discount rates and suggests the pressure that puts on BNPL providers&#8217; business models may lead them to seek to monetize the data they collect on users:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;BNPL lenders have access to the valuable payment histories of their customers. Some have used this collected data to create closed loop shopping apps with partner merchants, pushing specific brands and products, often geared toward younger audiences. As <strong>competitive forces pressure the merchant discount,</strong> lenders will need to find other sources of revenue to <strong>maintain growth and profitability</strong>. The Bureau would like to better understand practices around data collection, behavioral targeting, data monetization and the <strong>risks they may create for consumers</strong>.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>BNPL providers do have access to more data than, say, credit card companies, in that they have item-level detail of each transaction. Still, no BNPL company is operating at the scale of Big Tech companies like Google, Amazon, or Facebook &#8212; another recent target of <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-orders-tech-giants-to-turn-over-information-on-their-payment-system-plans/">CFPB scrutiny around data practices</a>.</p><h2>FDIC Drama Continues: Chair Fires Back in WSJ Op-Ed</h2><p>In a sign that the FDIC board drama isn&#8217;t likely to be resolved quickly, Trump-appointed Chair Jelena McWilliams fired back at Democratic-appointed FDIC board members Rohit Chopra and Martin Gruenberg &#8212; in the form of a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/hostile-takeover-fdic-board-rohit-chopra-michael-hsu-jelena-mcwilliams-abuse-power-11639432939">Wall Street Journal op-ed</a>. In it, she said (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<strong>This conflict isn&#8217;t about bank mergers</strong>. If it were, board members would have been willing to work with me and the FDIC staff rather than attempt a <strong>hostile takeover of the FDIC</strong> internal processes, staff and board agenda.</p><p>This episode is an attempt to wrest control from an independent agency&#8217;s chairman with a change in the administration. More than that, <strong>it&#8217;s an example of the erosion of America&#8217;s democracy</strong>. Many government institutions are <strong>built on norms and practices that encourage parties to work together</strong>. This foundation depends on agency leaders who recognize that the long-term benefits of cooperation outweigh the short-term incentive to blow up institutions in pursuit of immediate partisan gains.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Even if Ms. McWilliams is sincere in her belief, she would do well to read the room. A Trump-appointee, the party McWilliams belongs to (whether or not she agrees with it) spent an entire administration destroying the &#8220;norms and practices that encourage parties to work together.&#8221;</p><p>And, as far as the &#8220;erosion of America&#8217;s democracy,&#8221; McWilliams&#8217; party is in the process of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/14/trump-president-2024-election-coup-republicans">laying the groundwork</a> to overturn the outcome of future elections if they don&#8217;t turn out in their favor.</p><p>So forgive me if I&#8217;m not up in arms about her colleagues&#8217; <a href="https://www.creditslips.org/creditslips/2021/12/fdic-power-struggle.html">arguably legal attempts</a> to bypass her obstructionism to implement the current administration&#8217;s chosen policies (<em>even if I don&#8217;t personally agree with all of those policies</em>).

First, the one grabbing most of the headlines: <strong>dueling statements released by the CFPB and the FDIC</strong> on Thursday.</p><p>Rohit Chopra, recently confirmed Director of the CFPB, and Martin Gruenberg, both of whom sit on the FDIC&#8217;s board, <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_bank-merger-act-rfi_joint-statement_2021-12.pdf">released a statement</a> that the FDIC had approved a request for public comment on policy governing bank merger transactions (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;The Board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has approved a Request for Information and Comment on Rules, Regulations, Guidance, and Statements of Policy Regarding Bank Merger Transactions. This marks <strong>the beginning of a careful review of the effectiveness of the existing regulatory framework</strong> in meeting the requirements of the Bank Merger Act. Effective implementation of the Bank Merger Act has deep implications for the safety and soundness, financial stability, community accountability, and competitiveness of the banking system. <strong>We strongly support this Request for Comment</strong>.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Notably, the statement was <strong>released on the CFPB&#8217;s website</strong> rather than the FDIC&#8217;s.</p><p>The FDIC <strong>quickly fired back</strong> with <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2021/pr21101.html">its own statement</a> (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Earlier today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) posted on its website a document, purportedly approved by the FDIC, requesting comment on bank mergers.&nbsp;<strong>No such document has been approved by the FDIC.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The FDIC has longstanding internal policies and procedures for circulating and conducting votes of its Board of Directors, and for issuing documents for publication in the Federal Register.&nbsp;In this case, there was <strong>no valid vote by the Board</strong>, and no such request for information and comment has been approved by the agency for publication in the Federal Register.&nbsp;</p><p>The FDIC has a proud 88-year history of Board members working together in a collegial manner.&nbsp;This history has spanned many Presidential administrations, and countless philosophical differences on substantive issues among Board members over the years.&nbsp;<strong>Notwithstanding the actions taken today, the FDIC expects this time-honored tradition of collegiality and comity to continue.</strong>&#8221;</p></blockquote><h4>So what&#8217;s going on here?</h4><p>The FDIC is governed by a five member board, which, by law, can have no more than three board members appointed by the same political party.</p><p>Currently, it consists of Chair <strong>Jelena McWilliams</strong>, a Trump appointee; <strong>Michael Hsu</strong>, the Acting Comptroller of the Currency; <strong>Rohit Chopra</strong>, the Director of the CFPB; and <strong>Martin Gruenberg</strong>, former Chair of the FDIC and current FDIC director; the fifth slot is vacant.</p><p>That makes the math 3-1 in favor of Democrats. McWilliams&#8217; term as Chair runs through 2023.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c2e9d80-b33a-4eb5-8c46-d61a815e014f_779x670.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c2e9d80-b33a-4eb5-8c46-d61a815e014f_779x670.png" width="779" height="670" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3c2e9d80-b33a-4eb5-8c46-d61a815e014f_779x670.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:670,&quot;width&quot;:779,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:374342,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c2e9d80-b33a-4eb5-8c46-d61a815e014f_779x670.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c2e9d80-b33a-4eb5-8c46-d61a815e014f_779x670.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c2e9d80-b33a-4eb5-8c46-d61a815e014f_779x670.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c2e9d80-b33a-4eb5-8c46-d61a815e014f_779x670.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Image: <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/about/leadership/">FDIC.gov</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>While both sides have yet to make their legal arguments clear, what appears to have happened is that the Democratic appointees voted to approve the request for information, while Chair McWilliams seems to be arguing that, as Chair, she controls the agenda for FDIC board meetings, and thus the vote was illegitimate. According to Adam Levitin in <a href="https://www.creditslips.org/creditslips/2021/12/fdic-power-struggle.html">Credit Slips</a> (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s the argument, <strong>it is plainly wrong</strong>. The FDIC is governed first and foremost by federal statute and then secondarily by its own bylaws. Federal law <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/1812">vests management of the FDIC in its board of directors</a>. Federal law also gives the FDIC the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/1819">power to adopt bylaws</a>. There is <strong>nothing in federal statute specifically empowering the FDIC chair to set agendas</strong>. Indeed, there is very little that federal statutes prescribe for the FDIC chair.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>While it appears the law is on the side of the Democratic appointees, if Chair McWilliams decides to fight, she could drag out the process, thus delaying the Democratic appointees&#8217; agenda.</p><h4>What&#8217;s in the Request for Information?</h4><p>The second story: the power struggle drama seems to have overshadowed the substance of the request for public comment &#8212; how bank mergers are considered for approval by federal regulators.</p><p>The RFI argues that a review and potential update of regulators&#8217; framework for assessing proposed bank mergers is needed in light of continued consolidation in the sector, in order for regulators to fulfill their responsibilities to promote public confidence in the banking system and to ensure financial stability.</p><p>Data included in <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_bank-merger-act_rfi_2021-12.pdf">the RFI</a> show that the number of banks, particularly those with less than $10 billion in assets, have declined, while concentration of assets in the largest institutions has increased (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Consolidation also has materially altered the economic landscape of insured depository institutions with assets less than $100 billion. Over the same 30-year period, the number of institutions with assets less than $10 billion has <strong>declined drastically from 15,099 in 1990 to 4,851 in 2020</strong>, a reduction of approximately 68 percent.</p><p>The declining number of smaller insured depository institutions may <strong>limit access to financial services and credit in communities</strong>, potentially adversely affecting the welfare of the communities&#8217; workers, farmers, small businesses, startups, and consumers.&#8221;</p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F413e0a35-3ab0-4a48-ace6-c367bdb0252f_483x649.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F413e0a35-3ab0-4a48-ace6-c367bdb0252f_483x649.png" width="483" height="649" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/413e0a35-3ab0-4a48-ace6-c367bdb0252f_483x649.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:649,&quot;width&quot;:483,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:87567,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F413e0a35-3ab0-4a48-ace6-c367bdb0252f_483x649.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F413e0a35-3ab0-4a48-ace6-c367bdb0252f_483x649.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F413e0a35-3ab0-4a48-ace6-c367bdb0252f_483x649.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F413e0a35-3ab0-4a48-ace6-c367bdb0252f_483x649.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Image: <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_bank-merger-act_rfi_2021-12.pdf">CFPB.gov</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>While Chopra and Gruenberg&#8217;s arguments are primarily grounded in financial stability concerns, they also make reference to potential negative consequences on consumer access to financial services and credit from increased consolidation in the banking sector.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F54346bd1-f321-4c66-9fc9-11f23fa06af7_690x426.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F54346bd1-f321-4c66-9fc9-11f23fa06af7_690x426.png" width="690" height="426" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/54346bd1-f321-4c66-9fc9-11f23fa06af7_690x426.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:426,&quot;width&quot;:690,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:41029,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F54346bd1-f321-4c66-9fc9-11f23fa06af7_690x426.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F54346bd1-f321-4c66-9fc9-11f23fa06af7_690x426.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F54346bd1-f321-4c66-9fc9-11f23fa06af7_690x426.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F54346bd1-f321-4c66-9fc9-11f23fa06af7_690x426.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Data: FDIC; Image: Fintech Business Weekly</figcaption></figure></div><p>They highlight the shrinking number of smaller banks and branch closures as risks and position increased scrutiny of bank mergers as a potential antidote.</p><p>One doesn&#8217;t have to look too far back to confirm there are risks that stem from the increasing size and complexity of financial institutions; 2008 wasn&#8217;t <em>that</em> long ago.</p><p>Still, focusing regulatory efforts on throwing up barriers to bank mergers feels like an effort to freeze time to preserve a banking world as it used to be, rather that focusing on creating forward looking regulation and policy to foster competition in the banking world of today and tomorrow.</p><p>Banking is no longer a geographically-bound business. Banks&#8217; branch networks have been a depreciating asset for decades and, despite progressive regulators&#8217; best efforts, that is unlikely to change.</p><p>The absence of physical, geographic constraints makes banking even <em>more</em> of a scale game than it was in the days of branch banking. The companies that can afford to invest in tech and operate at a national scale are likely to continue to grow &#8212; a paradigm that doesn&#8217;t favor small, local banks.</p><p>If federal banking regulators are keen to encourage competition, creating a streamlined path for de novo bank licensing and a new non-depository &#8220;fintech&#8221; license may be a better approach than trying to turn back the clock by making bank mergers more arduous.</p><h2>JPMorgan Chase Begrudgingly Trims Overdrafts, Allows 2-Day Early Direct Deposit</h2><p>Fresh off the news that Capital One will eliminate overdraft and NSF fees altogether, JPMorgan Chase, America&#8217;s largest bank by assets, has decided to&#8230; give its customers a one business day grace period before assessing an overdraft fee.</p><p>Okay, okay, to be fair, earlier this year, Chase expanded its fee-free overdraft amount from $5 to $50, meaning users can overdraft by up to $50 without incurring a fee. The bank also eliminated NSFs, which were incurred when a transaction was attempted that Chase <em>didn&#8217;t</em> pay on the users&#8217; behalf.</p><p>Now, Chase is giving its customers a one day grace period to bring their account below the $50 threshold to avoid an overdraft fee; according to the <a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/ir/news/2021/chase-helps-more-than-two-million-customers-avoid-overdraft-service-fees">press release</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Continuing with the enhancements made this year, in 2022 the bank will provide more ways for consumers to avoid overdraft fees by enhancing its services to include:</p><p><strong>Providing a day to catch up. </strong>Customers will&nbsp;have until the end of the next business day to<strong>&nbsp;</strong>bring their balance back to $50 overdrawn or less to avoid overdraft service fees from the previous day.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Chase will also make payroll direct deposits available up to two days early, a feature popularized by neobank Chime.</p><p>About 1% of Chase&#8217;s revenue is derived from overdraft fees. According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/08/jpmorgan-chase-reduces-bank-overdraft-fees-in-bid-for-customers.html">CNBC</a>, the latest changes together with those made earlier this year may have a material impact on Chase&#8217;s financials (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;The moves, together with changes the bank initiated in August, <strong>will have a &#8216;not insignificant&#8217; impact on bank revenue</strong>, said Jenn Piepszak, co-CEO of the Chase segment of JPMorgan, who declined to be more specific in an interview.&#8221;</p></blockquote><h2>Monzo Valuation Bounces Back in $500m Fundraise</h2><p>Monzo, which saw its valuation slashed in a fundraising down round during the early days of the pandemic, seems to be back. The UK neobank <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/monzo-fundraise-2021/">confirmed</a> it has <strong>raised a fresh $500m at a valuation of $4.5 billion</strong> &#8212; a sharp increase from its previous <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/monzo-downround-coronavirus/">~$1.66 billion valuation</a>. The round included new investors Abu Dhabi Growth Fund, Coatue, and Alpha Wave Ventures.</p><p>It&#8217;s possible recent raises and increasing valuations for fellow neobanks like Revolut, N26, Chime, and Varo made Monzo look like a comparative bargain.</p><p>Prior to this raise, Monzo was <strong>valued at considerable discount vs. its peers</strong> on a per user basis:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7758d713-ca3b-409d-9011-aea29b36d288_737x456.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7758d713-ca3b-409d-9011-aea29b36d288_737x456.png" width="737" height="456" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7758d713-ca3b-409d-9011-aea29b36d288_737x456.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:456,&quot;width&quot;:737,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:49296,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7758d713-ca3b-409d-9011-aea29b36d288_737x456.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7758d713-ca3b-409d-9011-aea29b36d288_737x456.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7758d713-ca3b-409d-9011-aea29b36d288_737x456.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7758d713-ca3b-409d-9011-aea29b36d288_737x456.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Monzo&#8217;s valuation per user, prior to most recent fundraising</figcaption></figure></div><p>Monzo also struggled with executive turn over, with founder/CEO Tom Blomfield stepping away at the beginning of 2021, citing mental health issues amidst the pandemic. Still, with growing customers and revenues and a string of product expansions, the company seems to have turned a corner, at least in its home market. </p><p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9e9bbe27-2dac-447b-a015-b2cd3bc9c868">According to the FT</a>, <strong>25% of revenues came from new products launched during the pandemic</strong>, like premium consumer and business accounts; the company has reportedly reached 5m users with approximately 100,000 joining each month.</p><p>The change in fortunes may not translate to Monzo&#8217;s fledgling attempt to enter the US market, however. Its banking license application was quickly rebuffed by banking regulators.

This strategy is evident in the metastasization of BNPL across the shopping landscape: what started as an option at checkout is now available as a virtual card, physical card, at the point-of-sale in bricks and mortar locations, as a browser extension, as a shopping app, and so on.</p><p>But to be relevant to <em>all</em> of a consumers&#8217; potential purchases, not just the ones they are looking to finance, <strong>requires a pay-in-full option</strong>. Thus, the &#8220;Pay Now&#8221; button.</p><p>It doesn&#8217;t hurt that providing the pay-in-full option helps BNPL providers like Affirm to rebut consumer advocates&#8217; argument that the companies encourage consumers to make purchases they otherwise couldn&#8217;t afford.</p><p>Why would a user choose to pay via an Affirm button vs. an existing debit or credit payment card? Potentially, <strong>convenience</strong>: if Affirm already has stored payment credentials for a user, it compresses the payment experience to a single button, much like PayPal, Fast, and fellow BNPL <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/klarna-offers-pay-now-option-in-u-s-klarna-card-coming-soon/">Klarna&#8217;s &#8220;Pay Now&#8221;</a> option.</p><p>The bigger draw may be the <strong>cash back rewards</strong> Affirm is promising &#8212; though the perk is <strong>limited to participating merchants</strong>: </p><blockquote><p>&#8220;When shopping in the Affirm App at a participating merchant &#8212; labeled throughout the Affirm App with a cash back offer or found in the &#8216;Cash Back with Affirm&#8217; page &#8212; consumers will select the option to choose their debit or credit card and enter their information to pay in full at checkout.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>In Affirm&#8217;s case, the cash back promotion <strong>serves an additional purpose</strong>: to drive users towards its savings account, offered though bank partner Cross River Bank. In order to receive the cash back offer, <strong>users must have an Affirm savings account</strong>.</p><p>Together with Affirm&#8217;s yet-to-launch decoupled debit offering, you can see the outline of how the company can offer a synthetic full stack of spending, financing, and savings products &#8212; all without owning or operating many of the underlying pieces itself.</p><h2>Crypto Execs Testify in House Financial Services Committee Hearing</h2><p>Crypto seems to be one of Congress&#8217; favorite topics lately. Next week, the Senate Banking Committee will hold a hearing about stablecoins. Last week, the House Financial Services Committee hosted execs from crypto companies.</p><p>The House hearing, titled &#8220;Digital Assets and the Future of Finance: Understanding the Challenges and Benefits of Financial Innovation in the United States,&#8221; included representatives from <strong>Circle, FTX, Bitfury, Paxos, Stellar Development Foundation, and Coinbase</strong> &#8212; a group that included former Acting Comptroller <strong>Brian Brooks</strong>, now the CEO of Bitfury. Two more contentious companies, Meta (Facebook) and Tether, were not represented at the hearing.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/08/business/house-financial-services-crypto.html">New York Times</a> (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;The hearing was called by Representative Maxine Waters, the California Democrat who leads the committee, as part of an effort to understand fast-growing digital assets &#8212; and how to regulate them. It followed familiar partisan patterns, with <strong>Democrats expressing concern about crypto&#8217;s risks as Republicans emphasized innovation and said that strict regulation would drive the industry away</strong> from the United States.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>And according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-08/key-takeaways-from-crypto-stablecoin-hearing-before-house-panel">Bloomberg</a> (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Notably absent from the hearing were executives from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-03/tether-gives-more-details-on-assets-backing-crypto-stablecoin" title="Tether Fails to Dispel Mystery on Stablecoin&#8217;s Crucial Reserves">Tether,</a> the world&#8217;s biggest stablecoin with an estimated market value of about $76 billion. Plenty of allusions to Tether were made, however, as participants talked about <strong>the need for greater transparency of stablecoin reserves</strong>.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>While Congress has shown a keen interest in crypto lately, legislative action seems unlikely to move quickly, barring a major blowup in the sector, particularly given the 50-50 split in the Senate.</p><p>Instead, any increased regulation of the sector is likely to stem from authority already held by the SEC, CFTC, and banking regulators.</p><h2>Update: Fintech Meetup, March 22-24 (Online)</h2><p><strong>Sponsored content:</strong> No, it's not too early to start thinking about 2022 already.

What Does It Mean for Bank/Fintech Partnerships?</h2><p>Last week, online lender OppFi reached an approximately <a href="https://thedcline.org/2021/11/30/press-release-ag-racine-announces-over-2-million-settlement-with-predatory-online-lender-will-compensate-thousands-of-district-consumers/">$2.4 million settlement</a> in a case brought by Washington, DC&#8217;s Attorney General. In DC, OppFi, together with its bank partner FinWise, a Utah state chartered bank, offered loans at APRs up to 160% APR &#8212; well in excess of DC&#8217;s 24% usury cap.</p><p>The AG&#8217;s key argument in the <a href="https://oag.dc.gov/sites/default/files/2021-04/OppLoans-Complaint-final.pdf">original complaint</a> was that OppFi, not its bank partner, was the &#8220;<a href="https://fintechbusinessweekly.substack.com/p/dc-attorney-general-takes-aim-at">true lender</a>,&#8221; and thus operating in DC without proper licenses and in violation of the 24% usury cap.</p><p>The complaint stated (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;OppFi is the true lender of OppLoans. OppFi has the <strong>predominant economic interest</strong> in OppLoans, bears the risk of poor loan performance, and funds the expenses for the provision of the loans.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>and continued (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;FinWise&#8217;s risk and reward in conjunction with these loans is minimal. Both <strong>FinWise&#8217;s fees and its expenses are capped</strong> under its agreements with OppFi. OppFi&#8217;s assumption of the risk and purchase of the receivables is guaranteed through their agreements with FinWise&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Per the terms of the settlement, <a href="https://thedcline.org/2021/11/30/press-release-ag-racine-announces-over-2-million-settlement-with-predatory-online-lender-will-compensate-thousands-of-district-consumers/">OppFi is required to</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;Pay a total of $1.5 Million in restitution to refund impacted District consumers:&nbsp;</strong>The funds will compensate District&nbsp;consumers&nbsp;who paid interest on their loans in an amount greater than they would have paid had the interest due on any loan been calculated at a 24% APR.</p><p><strong>Pay a total of $250,000 to the District.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Waive over $640,000 in past due interest owed by District consumers who took out loans from OppFi:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>OppFi will be immediately providing this debt forgiveness to District consumers that paid interest over what OppFi was legally permitted to charge.</p><p><strong>Follow District law that protects consumers:&nbsp;</strong>OppLoans&nbsp;will not on its own, or working with third parties such as banks, engage in any act or practice that violates the CPPA in its offer, servicing, advertisement, or provision of loans to District consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cease charging rates above the District&#8217;s legal cap:</strong>&nbsp;OppLoans&nbsp;will not provide loans to District consumers at an interest rate above 24% APR, the cap in the District.</p><p><strong>Accurately represent its company to consumers:&nbsp;</strong>OppLoans&nbsp;will not represent that it is permitted to offer loans in the District without possessing any required District money lender license.&#8221;</p></blockquote><h4>&#8220;Rent a Bank&#8221; Argument Is A Means to an End</h4><p>States <strong>can&#8217;t do anything about</strong> the <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/LSB/LSB10512">interest rate preemption rights</a> that banks like FinWise enjoy, and <strong>they know it</strong>. FinWise could begin offering loans at 160% in DC tomorrow directly, and there&#8217;s <strong>little the AG could do to stop it</strong>. </p><p>And so jurisdictions that are opposed to certain products &#8212; typically, credit with rates higher than 36% APR, are deploying alternate approaches to discourage companies from offering them. </p><p>And, in this case, <strong>it worked</strong>. Rather than engage in a lengthy legal battle, particularly for a relatively small market, OppFi paid to settle and <strong>ceased operating in DC</strong>. </p><p>According to an OppFi spokesperson (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Although OppLoans denies the allegations in the complaint filed by the District of Columbia and denies that it has violated any law or engaged in any deceptive or unfair practices, <strong>this matter was resolved to avoid the expense of protracted litigation.</strong>&#8221;</p></blockquote><h4>The case may be settled, but the question of who is the true lender in bank/fintech partnerships is not</h4><p>Arguably, the settlement increases uncertainty for fintechs operating under this model. This is particularly true for those offering products at APRs in excess of a given state&#8217;s usury limit &#8212; rates that <a href="https://www.findlaw.com/state/consumer-laws/interest-rates.html">vary considerably</a> by jurisdiction.</p><h4><strong>Is This A Win for Consumers?</strong></h4><p>DC&#8217;s case here was supposedly about &#8220;consumer protection.&#8221; So, <strong>are consumers better off</strong> with OppFi no longer offering loans to DC residents?</p><p>Much of the discussion around this question tends toward the ideological, with consumer advocates&#8217; narrative grounded in &#8220;<strong>protecting borrowers from debt traps</strong>&#8221;, while industry advocates argue higher APR products expand &#8220;<strong>access, inclusion, and choice.</strong>&#8221;</p><p><strong>Reality is more complicated</strong>; it depends on when, how, and why consumers are borrowing, and how their financial circumstances evolve over time. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1062976916300515">Evidence</a> of the impact of availability of small-dollar loans on financial outcomes is mixed.</p><p>A borrower who was using a 160% APR product from OppFi <strong>won&#8217;t magically qualify for a 24% loan now</strong> that the company has stopped operating there; instead, they&#8217;re <strong>likely to turn to other forms of small-dollar credit</strong>, which may not carry the same disclosures and consumer protections as a loan: buy now, pay later, overdrafts, cash advances (eg Dave, MoneyLion), earned wage access, tribal lenders, etc.</p><h4>Support this Newsletter &#8212; and Financial Health Non-Profits</h4><p>For just $15 per month, you can <strong>support independent fintech journalism</strong> &#8212; I&#8217;ll also be donating a portion of revenue to non-profits focused on improving financial health, access &amp; inclusion.</p><p>The first recipient will be the <strong><a href="https://www.missionassetfund.org/about/">Mission Asset Fund</a></strong>, which will receive <strong>15% of all subscription revenue </strong>received through December 31:</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://fintechbusinessweekly.substack.com/subscribe&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Upgrade to a Paid Subscription&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://fintechbusinessweekly.substack.com/subscribe"><span>Upgrade to a Paid Subscription</span></a></p><h2>Capital One To Stop Charging Overdraft Fees as CFPB Warns on Some Banks&#8217; &#8220;Deep Dependence&#8221;</h2><p>Capital One is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/capital-one-is-latest-bank-to-ditch-overdraft-fees-11638393702">the latest</a> &#8212; and largest &#8212; bank to <strong>eliminate overdraft and NSF fees</strong> on consumer checking accounts, a policy change which will take effect next year.

Last week, the CFPB released a <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_overdraft-call_report_2021-12.pdf">pair</a> <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_overdraft-core-processors_report_2021-12.pdf">of reports</a> on overdraft practices.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-research-shows-banks-deep-dependence-on-overdraft-fees/">press release</a> (emphasis added): </p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Banks <strong>continue to rely heavily</strong> on overdraft and non-sufficient funds (NSF) revenue, which reached an estimated $15.47 billion in 2019, according to research released today by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Three banks&#8212;JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America&#8212;brought in 44% of the total reported that year by banks with assets over $1 billion.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>While it&#8217;s true that JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America collect a large proportion of industry-wide fee revenue, it comprises a small proportion of those banks&#8217; operating revenue &#8212; only about 2-4% &#8212; <strong>hardly &#8220;deep dependence&#8221;</strong> on the fees as a revenue source:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc7cf669-6c7f-406d-94fd-718ca31f178e_618x630.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc7cf669-6c7f-406d-94fd-718ca31f178e_618x630.png" width="618" height="630" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fc7cf669-6c7f-406d-94fd-718ca31f178e_618x630.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:630,&quot;width&quot;:618,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:169004,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc7cf669-6c7f-406d-94fd-718ca31f178e_618x630.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc7cf669-6c7f-406d-94fd-718ca31f178e_618x630.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc7cf669-6c7f-406d-94fd-718ca31f178e_618x630.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc7cf669-6c7f-406d-94fd-718ca31f178e_618x630.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Image: <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/overdraft-fees-jump-40-yoy-but-still-headed-lower-from-2019-levels-66207671">S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>The reports analyze fee revenue coming from overdraft/NSFs, monthly service fees, and ATM fees. &#8220;Reliance&#8221; is defined as the proportion of overall fee revenue coming from overdrafts/NSFs (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;In this report, we consider how these three types of fees (which we refer to collectively as &#8220;listed fees&#8221;) have evolved since banks with assets over $1 billion started reporting on them in 2015. In addition, we introduce the concept of &#8220;overdraft/NSF fee reliance&#8221; (or at times simply &#8220;reliance&#8221;), <strong>which we define as the share of overdraft and NSF fees among the listed fees at a given institution</strong>.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Even if the absolute amount of fees is declining, this framing would consider a bank &#8220;reliant&#8221; if the proportion of fee income coming from overdrafts/NSFs is stable.</p><p>Which is more or less what you see. Total fees and fees as a portion of operating revenue have declined since the beginning of the pandemic, and, while increasing from their Q2 2020 low, have remained below pre-pandemic levels. With banks continuing to lower or eliminate fees, there&#8217;s <strong>no immediate reason to think this trend will reverse</strong>.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3263267f-8558-4374-adbd-29e85bb55d27_683x482.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3263267f-8558-4374-adbd-29e85bb55d27_683x482.png" width="683" height="482" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3263267f-8558-4374-adbd-29e85bb55d27_683x482.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:482,&quot;width&quot;:683,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:56775,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3263267f-8558-4374-adbd-29e85bb55d27_683x482.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3263267f-8558-4374-adbd-29e85bb55d27_683x482.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3263267f-8558-4374-adbd-29e85bb55d27_683x482.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3263267f-8558-4374-adbd-29e85bb55d27_683x482.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Image: <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/overdraft-fees-jump-40-yoy-but-still-headed-lower-from-2019-levels-66207671">S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>While the CFPB&#8217;s comments and previous Congressional hearings have focused on America&#8217;s largest banks, <strong>it actually tends to be smaller banks</strong> that are more &#8220;reliant,&#8221;

good intentions may have unintended consequences. </h4><p>Overdrafts are a form of credit. By encouraging banks to lower the cost, basic economic theory would suggest <strong>this will also lower the supply</strong>: less overdraft credit will be extended.</p><p>As banks seek to mitigate potential losses, it&#8217;s logical that they would <strong>add additional qualification criteria</strong> for who can overdraft. For example, this could reduce access for those with less consistent direct deposit activity, a group that includes part-time or shift workers, whose paycheck amounts may vary, gig economy workers, freelancers, stay-at-home moms, and the unemployed.</p><p>Another possible side effect? Banks will seek to <strong>find a way to replace the lost revenue</strong>. When the Durbin Amendment capped interchange income for larger banks, they lost a key revenue generator for middle-income customers who enjoyed their free checking accounts. That change set the stage for increasingly aggressive service fees (overdraft/NSF, minimum balance, ATM), but those fees are disproportionately incurred by lower-income consumers.</p><p>As banks move away from overdraft fees, whether by choice or in response to regulatory action, new fees are likely to pop up to replace them &#8212; <strong>the question is, who will pay the bill?</strong></p><h2>Nubank Trims Target Valuation, Grab&#8217;s Shares Drop 21% on Trading Debut</h2><p><strong>Nubank</strong>, a neobank that operates in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariaabreu/2021/12/01/digital-bank-nubank-cuts-valuation-target-from-55-billion-to-42-billion/">lowered its price target</a> to $8-$9 per share in advance of its IPO. The updated price range lowers the company&#8217;s valuation target from $55 billion to approximately $42 billion. The company pointed to &#8220;<strong>current conditions in financial markets</strong>&#8221; &#8212; a recent rout in tech stocks driven by the Omicron variant &#8212; in explaining the lowered price target.</p><p>Meanwhile, Southeast Asian ride hailing / superapp company <strong>Grab</strong> <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cc605355-3f3e-44d9-ac70-32cc8dd7407a">completed</a> the world&#8217;s biggest SPAC deal, valuing the company at $40 billion, to began trading on the Nasdaq last week &#8212; and <strong>saw its share price drop 21%</strong>.
