Let&#8217;s get straight into it.</p><h4>How did you get interested in investing? What are your main areas of focus? Also, maybe you could talk a little about what you do for fun.</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Sleepwell</strong></p></blockquote><p>I was born and raised in South America and moved to the US for college where I studied engineering. In my sophomore year I started playing around with the stock market, having no idea what I was doing. I&#8217;ve always enjoyed learning about companies I find interesting, so this seemed like a fun way to (try to) make some money. Almost instantly I knew I wanted to work in finance. I did a few internships and landed a full-time job in one of the big investment banks. I worked in wealth management, rates and credit research and more recently in equity research covering industrials. Currently I&#8217;m taking some time off before I move on to the next adventure on the buy-side.</p><p>I consider myself a generalist. My areas of focus are music, technology, financials and industrials. I don&#8217;t limit myself to these, I&#8217;m always interested in learning about new companies that I find fascinating. Investing is a lot about pattern recognition, so there&#8217;s tremendous value in learning about different industries, even if you don&#8217;t end up investing in them.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of fun, I like having a balance between my creative side and being phisically active. I think both are important to lead a healthy and fulfilling life. On the creative side I&#8217;m a musician (I play guitar, sing and write songs) and just recorded my first album. My favorite sport is skiing, and I also enjoy running and hiking. It&#8217;s certainly not a coincidence that you&#8217;ll find some of these activities reflected in my portfolio ($SPOT $UMG $MTN).</p><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><h4>What inspired you to start posting on twitter, and where did the name Sleepwell come from?</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Sleepwell</strong></p></blockquote><p>I have used Twitter on the personal side for a long time and stumbled across FinTwit a few years ago, but didn&#8217;t interact too much. I noticed there was an interesting investing community, so I decided the best way to get more involved was to create an account solely focused on that. I took the anonymous route for work-related reasons, but then realized there were benefits to it: you&#8217;re actually building a brand and it&#8217;s very meritocratic based &#8211; people are judging solely based on the quality of content you post, not by how you look, how old you are, where you went to school or where you&#8217;re from. I thought that was very powerful.</p><p>The Sleepwell name is something that has been in the back of my mind for a while. It originally came from a Buffett quote from the 80&#8217;s when he said something like <em>&#8220;I sleep well at night knowing that billions of men will grow a beard tonight and have to shave tomorrow morning&#8221;, </em>talking specifically about his investment on Gillette. Over time it&#8217;s grown on me and now has its own bigger meaning. It&#8217;s as much about owning things that help me sleep well and doing things on a day to day that help me lead a better, happier and healthier life.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><p>Part of what makes investing enjoyable for me is the ability to mix my passions with making money. For example I have a deep interest in the future of AR/VR, so learning about the industry ends up being enjoyable. As you mention, you are a musician. </p><h4>I'd like to ask a bit about what you play/do music-wise? Also does the combination of your hobby with investing had any impact on your choice to focus your energy towards the audio sector?</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Sleepwell</strong></p></blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve played the guitar for almost 20 years and started singing more recently because I didn&#8217;t have a choice (nobody wanted to sing the songs I was playing!). I also recently recorded my first album, to be released this year, so I&#8217;m very excited for that. It was a great experience to learn about the industry from the artist perspective.</p><p>I&#8217;m a strong believer in investing in things that genuinely interest you, it&#8217;s such a big life hack. There&#8217;s no point in spending time studying an industry or company that bores you and you don&#8217;t enjoy researching, especially with all the hours that you have to commit to acquire the required knowledge, truly grasp what matters and develop your own view. This is not to say I won&#8217;t pay attention to what&#8217;s happening in other industries and learn lessons from them, but I wouldn&#8217;t see myself going deeply into an O&amp;G exploration company or a biotech startup. Naval says we should strive to find something that feels like play to us and work to everybody else, and that way you come out way ahead in life. I think that&#8217;s a very powerful idea that I try to apply to many aspects of my life.</p><p>This is why music (and more recently audio) was a very natural place for me to look at deeply. I enjoy spending time learning about it, researching it, really trying to understand where it&#8217;s going. I think my portfolio, over time, will be a reflection of the best businesses in sectors that I find fascinating and want to be constantly reading about and getting smarter on. I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s probably the only screening tool I use: &#8220;Will I have fun learning about this company?&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><p>Couldn&#8217;t agree more.</p><p>Now, lets move onto your investing &#8216;style&#8217;.</p><h1>Style</h1><p>One thing I find particularly interesting is the differing styles between investors. </p><h4>How would you describe your investing style? And how would you say your investing style has evolved over time?</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Sleepwell</strong></p></blockquote><p>I would describe my investing style as constantly trying to find what best fits my personality. I like to know what I own as best as I can, feel comfortable with the risks and to enjoy the research process. This can take me anywhere, and you&#8217;ll realize if you look at my portfolio that I own value, growth, compounders, serial acquirers, even special situations. I never think about them that way though, this is just the outcome of my process for finding companies that I find attractive and I&#8217;m not limiting myself to any bucket or style. Like many, I started in the traditional value investing school but have slowly migrated away from it, not to say I don&#8217;t seek a margin of safety, I just don&#8217;t think any of the traditional metrics like low P/B or P/E works as well as it used to, it&#8217;s a lot more complex and competitive today.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently I&#8217;ve been focused on extending the duration of my portfolio, by trying to find companies that I&#8217;m comfortable holding for a decade or more, but these ideas don&#8217;t come very often. This is especially true in today&#8217;s age of disruption where the average company lifespan has shortened significantly. In fact I&#8217;d say that I&#8217;ve probably found 4 so far that fit this criteria. If you&#8217;re successful in finding long duration quality assets at the right price, you&#8217;re likely to outperform. It&#8217;s been proven time and time again that time horizons are one of the few edges left in the market, you&#8217;re playing an entirely different game when you&#8217;re thinking about a company 10 years down the line when most of the market is focused on the next quarter or maybe the next year.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><h4>Do you have any main influences in terms of investing style?</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Sleepwell</strong></p></blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve gone through many stages in my investing life and try to read as much as I can about the most successful investors, regardless of their style. I think any fundamental investor can learn a lot about Druckenmiller or Soros, it&#8217;s kind of crazy to ignore what they&#8217;ve achieved. I also think it&#8217;s useful to study the great capital allocators like John Malone, Tom Murphy, Mark Leonard, just to name a few. At the end of the day, most of their company&#8217;s achievements have been driven by how they invested the excess cash flows their business generated, not as much by their operating expertise.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently I&#8217;ve really enjoyed reading the Nick Sleep (Nomad Partnership) letters &#8211; who went through a transformation in his own style. Twitter has also been an incredible place to find and connect with other investors. Alex Morris, Francisco Olivera, Andrew Walker, Josh Tarasoff, Eric Boroian, Mostly Borrowed Ideas, John Huber and Rishi Gosalia are some that come to mind who I&#8217;ve had the chance of connecting with, learning from and we&#8217;ve become friends through the platform. I&#8217;m truly grateful for that.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><h4>Do you have any common characteristics you look for in a company you end up investing in?</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Sleepwell</strong></p></blockquote><p>I can&#8217;t say all of them share one specific characteristic, but generally I try to look for good or great businesses where I can form a view and conclude with reasonable confidence that they&#8217;re being misunderstood by the market through a mispricing. It usually involves a company going through some kind of material change that perhaps doesn&#8217;t get captured in a DCF or a multiple lens. It could be in their strategy, a new business initiative, new competition, an acquisition program or a long term trend that the market hasn&#8217;t fully grasped.&nbsp;</p><p>If you look at any sell-side model, for example, you&#8217;ll find that they don&#8217;t model any M&amp;A, which for a company like Constellation Software is outright ridiculous, the founder and CEO literally tells investors acquiring other software companies is their core business. Other examples include companies that don&#8217;t have a good comparison or any precedent because they&#8217;re playing in a completely new industry (sometimes even building it themselves). You have to be able to see patterns, use second order thinking and borrow ideas from different mental models to figure out what the end-state may look like. It creates opportunity because the market tends to be more of a &#8220;show-me&#8221; state, and these things don&#8217;t show up in a financial statement.&nbsp;</p><p>I think when you can correctly identify opportunities like these before the market fully appreciates them you can make real handsome returns. I focus on ROIC, its defensibility over time, but more importantly, the reinvestment potential and any upward inflections in ROIC (i.e. ROIIC). It&#8217;s been proven that the market is not particularly good at forecasting this and there is a high correlation between ROIC direction and stock performance.&nbsp;</p><p>A good example is Ally Financial, the largest online bank and auto lender in the US, which I&#8217;ve owned since 2015. This was a restructuring story initially, which then became a successful turnaround and more recently has turned to a story of growth, optimization and new initiatives. Return on Equity a few years ago was in the mid-single digits (7-8%) and so logically, it traded below book value (~0.7X) because it was earning below its cost of capital. What the market was missing was that the legacy problems were behind them (subprime mortgage book, GM/Chrysler exposure) and they had built a great deposit and banking franchise that was low-cost, sticky and high growth (also replacing high interest debt), while on the asset side they had a nice moat around their auto lending business and new consumer banking products, like lending and investing. They also started buying back significant amounts of stock below book value. What this translated to was a visible path to high-teens/low-20% earnings growth and ROEs increasing to 15%. More recently management has guided to 16-18% over the medium term. The stock has performed well (up almost 200% in 5 years), but still trades at 1.1X book and 6-7x earnings, while still buying back a boatload of stock (12% of market cap). I think there&#8217;s still room to go as the market hasn&#8217;t yet fully appreciated the underlying growth and quality story given the valuation.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><h4>What is your typical allocation strategy? And what is your attitude towards risk?</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Sleepwell</strong></p></blockquote><p>I run a pretty concentrated portfolio, but it&#8217;s mostly my own money. My top 5 positions usually make up ~70% of my portfolio and the largest one around 20%. I realize this is unconventional, but I&#8217;m quite comfortable operating like this given the type of investments I own and the time I&#8217;ve spent doing work on the companies that make up the majority of my portfolio. There&#8217;s been a lot of studies that prove that beyond 7-10 stocks or so, there&#8217;s very limited benefits to diversification. I also focus a lot on the potential downside scenarios and risks, which comes natural given my fixed income background. Needless to say, I don&#8217;t mind the volatility and don&#8217;t have any investors (besides some family) to answer to or feel pressure from.</p><p>One way I like to think about my allocation, is that I&#8217;m essentially giving capital to the CEOs of my portfolio companies, just like if they were investors managing my money. I think it&#8217;s a helpful mental exercise. I&#8217;m quite comfortable outsourcing my capital to managers like Mark Leonard (Constellation), Daniel Ek (Spotify), Joe Shoen (U-Haul) and Reed Hastings (Netflix). Buffett has a great quote that says &#8220;If a CEO retains in earnings the equivalent of 10% of the company&#8217;s net worth every year and reinvests it in the business, he will have been responsible for 60% of the invested capital of the business in 10 years&#8221;. I think investors don&#8217;t spend enough time thinking about the capital allocation skills of management, which is a very big driver of investment outcomes over the long run.&nbsp;</p><h1>Spotify and audio</h1><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><p>Spotify was one of my very first deep-dives. It&#8217;s a company that has always interested me as an early adopter and investor. So I feel it would be a massive missed opportunity if I weren&#8217;t to ask you a few questions on the topic of spotify/audio, as it&#8217;s something you are so vocal about on Twitter.</p><p>In my opinion it's almost an illusion that the audio market is &#8216;mature&#8217;. It definitely has some incumbent players like the big record labels, however streaming as we know it today really only stemmed from the piracy age. As you can see from the graph below from Matthew Ball, it looks like the audio industry is just getting started. Especially with the recent introduction in things like social audio.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b5ecf84-07d8-468d-bd59-00074f0c1381_1500x882.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b5ecf84-07d8-468d-bd59-00074f0c1381_1500x882.png" width="1456" height="856" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2b5ecf84-07d8-468d-bd59-00074f0c1381_1500x882.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:856,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b5ecf84-07d8-468d-bd59-00074f0c1381_1500x882.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b5ecf84-07d8-468d-bd59-00074f0c1381_1500x882.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b5ecf84-07d8-468d-bd59-00074f0c1381_1500x882.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b5ecf84-07d8-468d-bd59-00074f0c1381_1500x882.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>I guess my first question is&#8230;</p><h4>&#8230;What do you see the audio opportunity to be? And why do you think Spotify is the best positioned company to benefit over other players like Apple Music?</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Sleepwell</strong></p></blockquote><p>Audio as a media format is very unique and probably a decade or two behind others like TV, social media and video games in terms of internet-level penetration and monetization. The reason for this is that piracy almost destroyed the industry and basically set it back in time. This meant they had to rebuild the business model from the ground up and successfully compete with a free product, so the consumer proposition of streaming had to be incredibly valuable in order to convince consumers to try and eventually pay for it. An incredible achievement if you ask me.&nbsp;</p><p>I think we&#8217;ve only started to see the tip of the iceberg of where the industry is going. Personally I think it will surpass the previous peak and most likely be multiples of what it used to be. Why? In the CD-era most of the market was made up of just four countries (US, Japan, UK, Germany) and people were spending on average $80 per year while getting just a handful of songs. That number today is probably half, and you have literally every song in the world in the palm of your hands, can listen to it at any time and get a personalized experience via recommendations. It&#8217;s also a lot more global. I think eventually people will end up spending more, because it&#8217;s a much higher value proposition vs. the old days and there&#8217;s a lot of big markets that will be monetized that previously weren&#8217;t.</p><p>Spotify is the only scaled global audio platform that&#8217;s solely focused on going after audio &#8211; both music and non-music content. It competes with the Big Tech companies, but importantly it has for a while, and has been beating them consistently, proven in terms of total of users, growth, retention and engagement metrics.&nbsp;</p><p>There&#8217;s a couple of factors that play to Spotify&#8217;s advantage. The first one is focus, which should not be understated. Since day 1, Spotify has been solely working on music streaming, and knowing what they were going up against (piracy, labels, lots of competitors) they well knew innovation and execution were key to their survival, so it&#8217;s become very much ingrained in their DNA to move fast, iterate and improve the product consistently. We also saw this three years ago when they shifted their strategy more broadly to audio, putting a lot of their energy into podcasting, and quickly becoming the biggest podcast player in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>The second advantage they have is scale. As the biggest music and audio streaming platform in the world, Spotify has more data (which feeds their recommendation engine), spends more on R&amp;D and specific to podcasting, can spend more on content which it can amortize over more users. They also have an advantage in aggregating the whole podcast market and introducing a better advertising model that connects brands with podcasters and listeners. I can&#8217;t really think of any other company that has a real shot at unlocking this, and Spotify is basically building this business in front of us, which strengthens the ecosystem and the overall value of the platform. Finally, given the low gross margin profile of the core subscription music streaming business, you either need to be scaled or have other businesses subsidize the product (like Big Tech does), this means it&#8217;s going to be unlikely that small subscale players survive as standalone in the long run and deters new competitors from entering the market.&nbsp;</p><p>The third advantage, which ties into scale, is personalization. Users spend over &#8531; of listening time in Spotify&#8217;s own playlist (algorithmic and editorial). If you add to that user generated playlists your own content library (liked songs, saved albums) probably another &#8531;. This means that almost 70% of the time users are listening to a curated personalized library, so even though music may be a commodity on its most stripped down version (a song or an album), presenting it in a highly unique and personalized way has a lot of value for consumers. Because Spotify has the most users, it is most likely to serve all users better recommendations through a combination of Machine Learning algorithms that leverages the existing data of hundreds of millions of users. Think about it this way: there&#8217;s a higher chance there&#8217;s somebody else with a very similar taste to yours versus other platforms. It&#8217;s very hard to catch up to that and it&#8217;s one of the reasons why Spotify user&#8217;s spend 2-3X on the platform compared to competitors.</p><p>Let me expand a bit more on the competitive landscape, because it&#8217;s an important part of the thesis. One way to think about this is asking yourself &#8220;If competition is so ruthless, with pockets as deep as they come, and the product is a commodity, why is Spotify still winning?&#8221; I think it&#8217;s instructive to think hard about this question. The Big Tech companies have unlimited resources (human capital, billions of cash lying around) and cross-selling advantages (Apple bundle, Amazon Prime, YouTube videos) and they still have not been able to catch up to Spotify, which maintains over a 2X advantage in paying users, even more so with ad-supported. Engagement is also higher and they&#8217;ve started raising prices in some markets. It&#8217;s quite clear that whatever Spotify is doing is working well and consumers are making a deliberate choice to stick with and join the platform. It&#8217;s important to keep a close eye on this and new developments, but so far these are the facts.&nbsp;</p><p>Geographically it also varies a lot. Apple is strong in the US, YouTube is big in Southeast Asia and India and there&#8217;s also a lot of local players in other regions (Anghami in the Middle East, Audiomack in Africa, JioSavvn in India). Tencent Music dominates China, but Spotify does not compete with them directly, they swapped an equity stake pre-IPO and now own ~8% stake in each other. Spotify is available in 180+ markets and has a global and local perspective, in some of these they will dominate and others not so much, but they have a very realistic shot of surpassing 1 billion users in the next 10 years. At 1 billion users, there&#8217;s a lot of strings they can pull to monetize more. As the former CFO used to say, &#8220;everything changes at scale&#8221;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><h4>What do you see as the biggest challenge for this industry? Intermediaries like the big record labels seem to be a big headache for Spotify and their profitability - at least in the short term. Maybe you could talk a little bit about this dynamic.&nbsp;</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Sleepwell</strong></p></blockquote><p>I think the biggest challenge going forward will be finding incremental ways to monetize to increase consumption spend per capita, which is still extremely low. This includes convincing ad-supported users to pay for a subscription in Emerging Markets. The way I see it, streaming as a consumer proposition has been proven to work, so it&#8217;s just a matter of time for it to become more fully penetrated over the next decade or two, which gives the industry great runway growth.</p><p>I expect there will be a core streaming revenue (with pricing power) and higher-value add-ons that will sit on top of it, benefiting everyone in the ecosystem (consumer, artist, Spotify, label etc.). Think for example about the super-fan, who pays the exact same amount as a casual listener to listen to their favorite artist. There&#8217;s a lot of things that could be done here to monetize that super-fan in more effective ways, and we know this person wants to support and pay up for their favorite artists. Ideas here range from NFTs to paying for extra-special content, such as a pre-release window or special edition merch. Ek has suggested there&#8217;s a lot more they can do in terms of monetization models.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of the labels and Spotify, I&#8217;ve been quite vocal about the misunderstandings of their relationship on Twitter. This is a <a href="https://twitter.com/sleepwellcap/status/1400858271863525377?s=21">symbiotic relationship</a> today, because they need each other and they must cooperate together to keep the industry healthy and growing. Spotify needs the labels, which account for 2/3 of music listening share, but the opposite is true as well: the labels need Spotify, which accounts for ~20% of their revenues (and growing, as opposed to labels shrinking in Spotify) and also represent their highest growth and margin revenue opportunity. These are public companies with financial metrics to meet and investors to please, who have been sold on the idea that streaming is the future. It&#8217;s pretty much out of the question that they consider pulling out the catalog, lose all that high margin revenue, be left dealing with the 3 Biggest Tech companies (where music is a low priority) and have to deal with a PR nightmare and onslaught of artists, songwriters and managers that stop getting paid, likely sue them. Listeners would clearly be upset as well. This also begs the question of what they get out of that, they can&#8217;t create another platform, they&#8217;re not a tech company and it takes years and billions, and they certainly don&#8217;t want to be left dealing with less competitors. The labels like to see Spotify growing as it directly benefits them and it&#8217;s more likely they will cooperate together going forward to keep growing the industry revenue pie.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><h4>What role do you think podcasting and live audio will have in Spotify&#8217;s future? Clubhouse seemed to be very popular then die. We&#8217;re beginning to see other audio-first apps pop up here and there. </h4><h4>Maybe at the same time, what&#8217;s your opinion on Spotify Greenroom? It seems like a potentially interesting experiment, but also hasn&#8217;t really taken off.</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Sleepwell</strong></p></blockquote><p>I think podcasting is a bigger opportunity than people realize. We&#8217;re talking about the equivalent of linear TV to streaming video on-demand, but in this case from radio to internet streaming audio (call it podcasting or live audio etc.). Radio is still almost a $40B industry (bigger than recorded music) which is crazy, and most of those dollars should migrate over to the internet once the ad-infrastructure is in place given a better experience and ad-targeting. Spotify is aggregating the podcast market but more importantly is creating an advertising network (advertisers, listeners and creators) that will unlock a lot of inventory and standardize this process in one central location, much like Google did for the web.&nbsp;</p><p>I agree that Greenroom is mostly an experiment and hasn&#8217;t taken off, but I think for that small price they really had no other option but to test it out and learn a few things. Rumors are that they will integrate it into the core Spotify app which I think would make sense, and Spotify acknowledges that the Live audio opportunity will unlock a lot of new opportunities for creators and fans like Q&amp;As, listening sessions, live concerts etc., so they definitely need to pay attention to that. It&#8217;s such an nascent market that it&#8217;s hard to predict exactly what it&#8217;s going to look like 10 years down the line. Live Audio is very much to be determined still if it&#8217;s really going to be a big thing - Clubhouse has been a flop by most accounts and Twitter Spaces has been Ok, but I wouldn&#8217;t call it a home-run either.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><p>Slight tangent, but one particular hot topic over the past year has been crypto. </p><h4>I&#8217;m wondering if you have any opinions on the state of the crypto market? If not, is it something you would be willing to learn more about? </h4><p>The reason I ask is because I see a potential link with Spotify and NFT&#8217;s (e.g. Spotify issuing an NFT if you buy tickets to a gig through the platform, or buy merch, or support the artist directly).&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Sleepwell</strong></p></blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve started doing some work in this space, specifically around blockchain and web3. I felt I was being irresponsible for not understanding a lot of these concepts and the underlying trends. I don&#8217;t have any strong opinions on the state of that market at the moment. It certainly feels very speculative in certain pockets but I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s necessarily anything wrong with that, we saw the same in the TMT bubble in the early 2000s and it would have been foolish to ignore it.</p><p>For Spotify and Music specifically, it&#8217;s definitely something I think about a lot, from both a risk and opportunity perspective. I know Daniel Ek has his eyes on this and they&#8217;re trying to find ways to see how they can get involved and help creators monetize better, and this seems to fit well here. NFTs are an interesting angle because it seems to be working very well to effectively monetize your most hardcore fans, but it&#8217;s tough to tell how much of it is actually people paying for the art or exclusivity vs. people speculating on these assets. It doesn&#8217;t seem to be for fundamental reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of the potential of a blockchain-powered music platform I have a hard time picturing what that would look like because it&#8217;s virtually impossible to build one without having the entire world&#8217;s catalog on it. We&#8217;ve seen examples of this many times (i.e. Tidal testing exclusives). Platforms like Audius are more like a Soundcloud for Web3, I don&#8217;t see how they could convince the labels to get on-board since they are the intermediaries they&#8217;re trying to disrupt. The other obstacle is creating a product that users love, because at the end of the day, the users are the ones who pick the winner. Building the perfect UX and acquiring users takes a lot of time and dollars. It&#8217;s no coincidence that the biggest music streaming companies were built by tech companies that have a lot of capital and Spotify which has spent billions in R&amp;D and marketing.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><p>Thanks Sleepwell.</p><p>Finally, lets move on to a couple of quickfire questions.</p><h1>Quickfire</h1><h4>What would be your advice to a new investor looking to get into stocks and investing?</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Sleepwell</strong></p></blockquote><p>Look for companies you genuinely interest you and you want to learn more about. This will make the entire process much more enjoyable and you&#8217;re more likely to put in the required work. Curiosity is also incredibly important, your interests will expand over time and will compound on itself.</p><p>Finally, I&#8217;d recommend every new investor to spend time writing down their investment thesis on a company, it will feel odd at first but you&#8217;ll surely get better at it. Writing is a great way to crystallize your thoughts and will make you a better thinker and investor; all the best investors I know of are also excellent writers.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><h4>What is your biggest investing mistake and what did you learn?</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Sleepwell</strong></p></blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve had two complete wipe-outs, but I actually wouldn&#8217;t consider them my biggest mistakes and they were also smaller positions. Mistakes of omission have been a lot more common and costly. These are investments that I did not invest in but probably should have as I knew the story well enough. Netflix comes to mind, I&#8217;ve understood their business model well enough to invest in the company since probably 2017, but I think back then I was too strict on price of entry, and I think it got to 10% above my target price&#8230;which was incredibly dumb! If you&#8217;re looking at owning a stock for the long term, a 10% difference on the entry point is literally a rounding error. Thankfully I learned my lesson and as a result became more flexible with this rule going forward&#8230; Something similar happened with Google where I thought below $1000 would be a great entry point, so once it got close enough I started buying it. Thankfully, because the stock never got below that price again and I would have missed it had I been very strict on that.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><h4>Do you have any books or podcasts you would recommend around investing?</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Sleepwell</strong></p></blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve probably learned more about investing from non-investment related books. I lay them out in <a href="https://twitter.com/sleepwellcap/status/1412079088777445379?s=21">this thread</a>. Three I&#8217;d particularly recommend from here are Influence, by Robert Cialdini; Superforecasting, by Phil Tetlock; and Da Vinci by Walter Isaacson.</p><p>I&#8217;ve also incorporated podcasts into my research process. I likely listen to the same podcasts most people do on investing, my favorite ones are The Business Brew and Business Breakdowns. I also like searching for the ticker, company or executive on Spotify. You&#8217;d be surprised how many interviews you usually find for a decent sized company.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><h4>If you had $100K which you were forced to invest now between 3 stocks (weighted equally) over the next 10 years, which 3 stocks would you choose, and why?</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Sleepwell</strong></p></blockquote><p>Spotify, Constellation Software and Amazon.</p><p>I have a pretty good visibility of their prospects of growth and the competitive environment for the next 10 years at current valuations, within reasonable confidence. I&#8217;m also quite comfortable with their risks and downside scenarios and I think they are different enough that they provide good enough diversification even though it&#8217;s only 3 stocks.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><p>That concludes my interview with Sleepwell.</p><p>I would like to say a massive thank-you to Sleepwell for the thoughtfulness of the answers here, and to once again strongly recommend you check out his work on both <a href="https://twitter.com/SleepwellCap">Twitter </a>and <a href="https://sleepwell.substack.com/">Substack</a>.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Innovestor</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Metaverse: Capitalist nightmare or digital revolution?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Short update: I&#8217;m currently working on my most in-depth piece yet, which will most likely be released in two parts over the coming weeks.

Background</h2><h4>&#8220;What is the metaverse?&#8221;</h4><p>My favourite way to describe what I believe the metaverse to be is by thinking of it as <strong>the &#8216;next big step&#8217; in the development of the internet.</strong></p><p>Lets break this down.</p><p>You could argue the internet&#8217;s development has followed three main stages, of which we are at the very beginning of the third stage.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Stage 1 - &#8216;Mainframe era&#8217;</strong></p><p>Firstly you have the internet of the late 80s and 90s which was mainly dial-up, slow, and not portable.&nbsp;</p><p>This portion of history can be charactarised as the &#8216;mainframe&#8217; era. Where large computers are owned and operated only by large companies (IBM, Universities etc). Importantly, they're connected only locally - I.e. they don&#8217;t tend to share information outside of their ecosystem.</p><p><strong>Stage 2 - &#8216;Personal Computing&#8217;</strong></p><p>The second phase, which is where we are at the tail end of right now, involves a wild increase in speed, portability and is typically charactarised by smaller and smaller devices. The smartphone was probably one of the most important things to come from this era.</p><p>As of the late 90s and early 2000&#8217;s, all of a sudden many small businesses have computers which they use daily - some homes even have a personal computer (PC). The continued development of the internet and its subsequent use-cases gave more of us a reason to own a computer. </p><p>That being said, we only had occasional access to that computing resource. It was in our living room, or our office - the infrastructure did not allow for portability.</p><p>Once the smartphone and mobile internet came out, it gave even more of us a reason to have a smartphone or a computer. Roughly 6.6 billion people worldwide now have a smartphone.</p><p>Internet access has been forever changed from temporary to constant. It&#8217;s all around us, all of the time.</p><p><strong>Stage 3 - &#8216;Metaverse&#8217; or &#8216;Web3&#8217;</strong></p><p>This third stage is not necessarily to do with the continued transition towards smaller and smaller devices, but more focused on virtual worlds and virtual simulations. It&#8217;s also to do with the ability to purchase &#8216;real&#8217; things via the virtual world  and, crucially, being able to purchase things that exist only in these virtual environments.</p><p>This stage is fairly hard to conceptualise due to having very limited real-life points of reference. However we are starting to see more and more examples (and clearer visions) of what this third stage of the internet might look like (albeit fairly dystopian and, arguably, not what I want my future to look like). E.g. Meta and Microsoft&#8217;s vision&#8230;</p><div id="youtube2-5DpJlRbbgGU" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;5DpJlRbbgGU&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5DpJlRbbgGU?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>In addition to the above, this newest stage will involve augmentation of the world around us - so not solely the idea of AR and VR inside of a headset, but more to do with a connection to the Internet of Things (IoT) and virtual representations of real life.</p><p>The key difference moving to this next stage, the metaverse, is that we will be living in an environment where computing surrounds us. It will almost become a part of us (arguably it already is). We will have perpetual access and interaction with computing resources.&nbsp;</p><p>One last way to distinguish this third phase of the internet, is to look at the relevance of <strong>3D rendered, real-time simulations.</strong></p><p>3D rendering is nothing new - it has existed for many decades. The difference in this new stage will be the level of cultural relevance as more and more people gain exposure. It will eventually bring the majority of people into these more visceral (3D) worlds.</p><h4>&#8220;Is the metaverse already here?&#8221;</h4><p>For most people over the age of about 25, the answer would probably be a resounding &#8216;no&#8217;. However, if you ask people under the age of 18, then I would guess that most feel we are, at the very least, at some sort of beginning phase.</p><p>There are several ways to think about this question:</p><p><strong>No.1,</strong> and arguably most important, is the fact that <strong>this is a very gradual process</strong>. For every phase of the internet, it is incredibly hard to pin-point the exact date for which it began. In fact, it is almost-impossible.</p><p>For example, if we look for a defining point where the mobile internet era began, there are several equally valid answers. You may look towards the start of the first digital networks (i.e. 2G&#8217;s inception). You might say the inception of mobile browsers (WAP). You might start with the inception of the iPhone or the Blackberry, which were the first mainstream devices for the mobile internet. Or you might even wait until the second iPhone, which was the first to use 3G - making the mobile internet usable for the masses.</p><p>The point is, each of these answers are correct in their own way - <strong>it&#8217;s a progression.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>No.2. </strong>In accepting this as a progression - we can begin to ask the question of &#8216;where are we now?&#8217;. And if we try to pinpoint our current position, it&#8217;s difficult to argue we haven&#8217;t started the process of change towards the metaverse. So, in order to prove this point, lets take a look at 3D virtual and social environments as a proxy for the current stage in development.</p><p>If we go back 6 years (2015/2016), we can estimate that millions of people were involved in virtual social environments. However, back then most virtual social environments were capped at around 10 - 20 people with only several billion dollars being spent on virtual items.</p><p>Fast forward just 6 years to 2021 and we have hundreds of millions of people (every day) spending significant time in these virtual worlds - with caps having increased to several hundred in some cases (Fortnite/Call Of Duty: Warzone). In addition, consumer spending in these virtual environments has increased over 10 fold to $55 billion, an order of magnitude change. This is mainly to do with the increase in popularity of these battle royale style games such as Fortnite, PUBG and Call of Duty.</p><p>Following on from the above, the social and cultural role this technology is beginning to play within key industries like film, theatre, automotive and much much more, is hard to deny.</p><p>So, looking at the progression made in these past 6 years alone - it&#8217;s hard to say we haven&#8217;t meaningfully started on the progression.</p><h4>&#8220;Is the metaverse going to be free for everyone? Or will it be controlled by a select few mega-cap corporations?&#8221;</h4><p>This question is hard to answer at this point in time. However, after having been pitched a fairly off putting vision of our future by Mark Zuckerberg, it&#8217;s important that this &#8216;metaverse&#8217; should be sculpted by the people who are going to use it - not the corporations who stand to benefit.</p><p>Anyway, it&#8217;s likely to be much, much larger than any one company. To illustrate, let's take a look at the internet so that we can compare.&nbsp;</p><p>The current digital economy is roughly 15% - 20% of the ~$85 Trillion Global economy.</p><p>However, the big 5 tech companies only account for about 10-15% of the digital economy - with the remaining 85-90% of the digital economy depending on endless smaller developers, hardware manufacturers, network experts and other infrastructure and optimization companies in order to thrive.</p><p>The metaverse will likely have similar dynamics.</p><h4>&#8220;Is the metaverse going to be a place where big tech companies keep expanding their advantage over the smaller players?&#8221;</h4><p>It seems fairly intuitive that we are likely to see a bunch of todays leaders do very well in the metaverse. However, we&#8217;re likely to see many new companies come to the forefront, too - companies whos current capabilities are not fully understood in the current market.</p><p>Again, we can draw parallels with the early internet giants such as AOL or Yahoo, where there was initial confidence that their first-mover advantage would remain. In reality, the business landscape of the internet of today looks nothing like it did back then. </p><p>So, one could argue that considering the level of growth which has occurred in only 5 or 6 years, there is plenty of potential for some of these smaller companies to thrive over the coming years.</p><div><hr></div><h2>2. Entertainment</h2><h4>Gaming and entertainment are several sectors with strong examples of early adoption of &#8216;metaverse technology&#8217; - <strong>&#8220;How will entertainment change?&#8221;&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>In a recent interview, Matthew Ball, a leading voice in the fields of the metaverse &amp; entertainment makes a very well-put point about the link between technology, entertainment, evolving demographics and the metaverse.</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;You go back to 2011. There were myriad news articles of an infant holding an iPad. And then after, they'll go to a magazine and they can't understand a magazine. They try to pinch to zoom. They try to swipe. And we laughed at it.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>It was on CBS. It was on ABC. It was in Time magazine. It was parodical because we could understand what was going wrong, but they could not. And of course, 10 years have passed since that. A one year old is now 11, a four year old is 14.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>They understand what was wrong all those years back, <strong>but what we can't appreciate is how different their frame of reference is.</strong>&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><p>If we take a look at how this plays out nowadays, we can take a look at Roblox as an example.</p><p>It&#8217;s no coincidence that the platform began to really take off in 2017 when the generation of iPad native kids started to become 6 to 10 years old.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb5b1462-02de-4404-aed9-fa2a96528756_1535x900.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb5b1462-02de-4404-aed9-fa2a96528756_1535x900.png" width="1456" height="854" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/eb5b1462-02de-4404-aed9-fa2a96528756_1535x900.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:854,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb5b1462-02de-4404-aed9-fa2a96528756_1535x900.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb5b1462-02de-4404-aed9-fa2a96528756_1535x900.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb5b1462-02de-4404-aed9-fa2a96528756_1535x900.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb5b1462-02de-4404-aed9-fa2a96528756_1535x900.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The primary demographic of Roblox is those kids.</p><p>Again, it comes back to the difference in reference points and our inability to relate to these differences having not had the same experiences. But these children tend to reject things like linear television - they were simply not designed for it.</p><p>And so, as Matthew nicely puts it&#8230;</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;&#8230;I think part of this is reflecting the generational shift, which is that <strong>technology has to be available before the generation that it is designed for </strong>in order to put it to best use.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>E.g. Facebook was possible long before Mark Zuckerberg created it. We know that it was not the most complicated product, but it took a 21 or 22 year old in college to know how to bring it together, then rapidly iterate upon it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>That gives me enormous faith in what entertainment is going to look like in a decade, even if I concede we will barely be able to recognize it.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><p>Basically, it's difficult to know what the entertainment industry will look like in a decade from now. But my bet is that it will look very much different than it does today.</p><p>The gaming industry is a great example of an industry willing to lead the way with new tech - be that VR, AR, haptics, 3D rendering (amongst a whole host of other technologies). Below is a well-known example from fortnite, where EPIC Games are starting to explore how entertainment might look inside virtual worlds. If nothing else it&#8217;s a completely unique way to experience live music, and is giving the medium some form of legitimacy - with the caliber of artists getting involved.</p><div id="youtube2-iTiBp-ORNEo" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;iTiBp-ORNEo&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:&quot;283&quot;,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iTiBp-ORNEo?start=283&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><h4>&#8220;Will the metaverse displace traditional entertainment? And if so, how?&#8221;</h4><p>Entertainment (along with gaming) is one of the few areas really pioneering the capabilities of the current metaverse and exploring ideas as to what it could be.</p><p>The most likely outcome, as I see it, is that the metaverse will follow a similar path of most other new mediums of entertainment - in that it is initially used <strong>in addition</strong> to other entertainment, but eventually is used <strong>in tandem</strong>. A classic example of this is how our music consumption has evolved as the technology has developed. Initially we started with live, then radio, then portable, now on-demand, followed by newer formats such as podcasts and audiobooks. The chart below from Matthew Ball demonstrates this.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15393013-3fe2-45b3-b357-5de835dd8cb1_1535x903.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15393013-3fe2-45b3-b357-5de835dd8cb1_1535x903.png" width="1456" height="857" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/15393013-3fe2-45b3-b357-5de835dd8cb1_1535x903.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:857,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;@ballmatthew_audio.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="@ballmatthew_audio.png" title="@ballmatthew_audio.png" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15393013-3fe2-45b3-b357-5de835dd8cb1_1535x903.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15393013-3fe2-45b3-b357-5de835dd8cb1_1535x903.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15393013-3fe2-45b3-b357-5de835dd8cb1_1535x903.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15393013-3fe2-45b3-b357-5de835dd8cb1_1535x903.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Back to the original point, in the last few years the majority of younger generations are consuming entire categories of media via the internet and their mobiles.</p><p>I linked the Ariana Grande video above, but there have been other examples such as Travis Scott on Fortnite, Lil Nas X on Roblox, or (as of just last week) Justin Bieber performing a live motion-capture performance.

Other use-cases:</h2><h4>Decentralised Finance and the Metaverse</h4><p>For those of you who follow the crypto space with any degree of closeness, you will have at some point come across the idea that crypto (or, more generally, decentralised finance) will have an important role to play within the metaverse ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p>And it&#8217;s easy to imagine how this might look - I.e. Digital tokens being used as a form of currency within a virtual world. It&#8217;s intuitive.</p><p>However, the real determining factor as to the system of payment used within the metaverse will probably come down to &#8216;what works best&#8217;. And it&#8217;s not clear to me that the use of crypto will be any more beneficial than regular payment methods (like visa). I.e. blockchain doesn&#8217;t seem to be a strict requirement of the metaverse.</p><p>Most of the things blockchain does in terms of payments can be done through other means. The question is, &#8216;which method is superior&#8217;? </p><p>That being said, I believe there are several credible arguments being made for the use of blockchain technology within the metaverse - and they are mainly to do with control and ownership.</p><p>For example,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Games_v._Apple"> remember the recent debacle with Epic Games and Apple?</a> One of the reasons why Epic Games sued Apple was to do with the premise that these large companies controlling the distribution channels actually strangles the smaller &#8216;for-profit&#8217; developers, and thereby decreases the potential creativity. If we use Roblox creators as an example - these smaller creators will have to end up paying both Roblox and Apple, and there becomes a point where there is very little left for the creator themselves.</p><p>The use of crypto could offer the ability to allow creators to create outside of the traditional platforms and walled gardens. It could empower creators to collectively own the technology through which they will build the metaverse - avoiding the current big-tech gatekeepers who currently control many of the decisions and profit share.</p><p>It may take some time to see how this area plays out.</p><h4>&#8220;Where could the metaverse really shine?&#8221;</h4><p>I believe there are many areas where an improved level of virtual connection would be beneficial. But one that really stands out to me is <strong>education.</strong></p><p>Education has traditionally been a difficult industry to disrupt. The global pandemic over the past several years has proven that our current technology is simply not cut out to be able to effectively educate remotely. Students and teachers hate it.</p><p><strong>&#8216;Presence&#8217;</strong> is a key word we see in many of the corporate presentations aiming to sell us on this idea of the metaverse. However, if we are able to truly create a better sense of presence with the use of VR/AR technology (or whatever the tech happens to be), things like education could dramatically improve.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd90b46b2-5fa6-469c-83e2-a849cf2c4daf_1204x684.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd90b46b2-5fa6-469c-83e2-a849cf2c4daf_1204x684.png" width="1204" height="684" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d90b46b2-5fa6-469c-83e2-a849cf2c4daf_1204x684.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:684,&quot;width&quot;:1204,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1597211,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd90b46b2-5fa6-469c-83e2-a849cf2c4daf_1204x684.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd90b46b2-5fa6-469c-83e2-a849cf2c4daf_1204x684.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd90b46b2-5fa6-469c-83e2-a849cf2c4daf_1204x684.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd90b46b2-5fa6-469c-83e2-a849cf2c4daf_1204x684.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>We would be able to see and feel our teacher, classmates and do something more meaningful than simply staring at a 2D screen on zoom. It could even allow us to enter virtual worlds which aren&#8217;t constrained by real-world limits - making for a far more memorable and engaging experience.</p><p>Entertainment is another compelling use-case which I have described in some detail above.</p><h4>&#8220;What&#8217;s the point? And why is it important?&#8221;</h4><p>So, at the end of the day, what's the point? Why is &#8216;metaverse&#8217; such a buzzword at the moment? And why is all of this important?</p><p>I think the significance here, and why so many people are starting to really get excited about &#8216;the metaverse&#8217;, is that it promises a better (more intimate) way to interact online. </p><p>More and more of our lives are spent online in one way or another - and it&#8217;s important to note that humans were not built for interaction via 2D mediums. We are most comfortable operating within 3 dimensions.</p><p>So, <strong>the point</strong> (so to speak) is that the metaverse has the potential to be a more intuitive, more intimate way to connect with the internet - something that is deeply ingrained into our way of life. But moreso, it offers an opportunity for a better way to connect and socialise with other human beings.</p><div><hr></div><h2>4.

So lets say, in reality, the metaverse poses a similar opportunity that the digital economy poses (15%-30% of the total economy) - we come to a fairly hefty ~$10 Trillion to $25 Trillion opportunity.</p><p>Its likely this opportunity will be distributed across many of the companies working on solving the solutions present today - from payment solutions, hardware producers, virtual platforms and other general infrastructure providers.</p><h4>&#8220;Who are the leading players, and who will they be in the future?&#8221;</h4><p>A good start in answering this questions is to look at the list of companies picked on the META ETF (above). There are some heavy weightings towards:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Nvidia</strong> - Digital infrastructure</p></li><li><p><strong>Roblox</strong> - Future platform and ecosystem</p></li><li><p><strong>Microsoft</strong> - Hardware and software pioneer</p></li><li><p><strong>Unity</strong> - 3D rendering leader</p></li><li><p><strong>Facebook</strong> - Virtual Reality leader</p></li></ul><p>In addition to these more obvious picks, there will be hundreds (if not thousands) of companies producing the hardware and software we will use to access the metaverse. This will include the microchips used to power the experiences, the mobile networks innovating on 5G and 6G in order to enable this technology. And all the way down to the content companies like Netflix, and Spotify who have to find a way to exist and monetise within this new environment.</p><h2>Closing thoughts</h2><p>So, where does all of this leave us?</p><p>After watching Facebook&#8217;s (now Meta&#8217;s) bold statement on what the metaverse is - something feels slightly off. It feels like Facebook have almost stolen the meaning of the word &#8216;metaverse&#8217;, or are at least making claim to the meaning of the word.</p><p>It feels like a land-grab - like a company calling themselves &#8216;the internet&#8217; back in 1995. But honestly, I see this as a smart move from Zuckerberg. He is making his intentions clear so that the people who are truly passionate about building the metaverse (or Web3) know where they can go to explore these concepts to the fullest. It&#8217;s one hell of a recruitment drive.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether or not the Metaverse will be fully conceptualised in the next 5 10 or 20 years, it&#8217;s important to note we&#8217;re still at a point where we can have a tangible say in what we want this future to look like. Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s vision of the metaverse doesn&#8217;t have to be the way it turns out.</p><p>But for the everyday investor, I believe this is the beginning of another large generational opportunity which you should at least be clued-up on.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Innovestor</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Investor interview: Intesi-Analyst]]></title><description><![CDATA[#2]]></description><link>https://innovestor.substack.com/p/investor-interview-intesi-analyst</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://innovestor.substack.com/p/investor-interview-intesi-analyst</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Innovestor]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 17:08:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13d333ec-ce85-4f0f-b87f-b9ade1f7b0df_400x400.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we have the second edition of the <strong>Investor Interviews </strong>segment where we take a look at investing from another unique perspective.</p><p><em>Subscribe below to get this type of content, along with company deep-dives and growth-portfolio insights directly into your inbox</em> &#128071;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://innovestor.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://innovestor.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>This second guest is known on twitter as<a href="https://twitter.com/InvestiAnalyst"> @InvestiAnlyst</a>, also known as Francis.

Background</strong></h2><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><p>Thank-you so much for agreeing to take part. To start, lets get to know Francis in some more depth.</p><p>Tell me a bit about your background.</p><h4><strong>&#8220;How did you initially become interested in investing? What are your main areas of focus? Also, talk a little about what you do for fun.&#8221;</strong></h4><blockquote><p><strong>Francis</strong></p></blockquote><p>Thank you for the opportunity.</p><p>I graduated with a business degree and a minor in Finance/Economics. I worked in the Data &amp; Analytics field as a Product manager, building Artificial Intelligence solutions and machine learning models for improving business decision-making. I currently work as a form of Economist, focused on Investment Attraction and Economic Development Strategy in Western Canada.</p><p>I started my journey as a value investor and transitioned happily into tech Investing primarily because I had a good amount of knowledge.</p><p>I am a BIG TIME European Soccer fan - Very passionate about everything Liverpool FC.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><p>Thanks for sharing. Great time to be a Liverpool supporter!</p><p>Do you have any personal link to the city? I&#8217;m a Norwich fan myself - which seems like not such a great decision lately...&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Francis</strong></p></blockquote><p>I watched Steven Gerrard growing up as a teenage after the Miracle of Instabul in 2005. I immediately feel in love with Liverpool.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><p>Can&#8217;t argue with that! I remember watching that game live when I was younger - what a night.</p><p>&#8230;</p><p>It&#8217;s interesting to me that your journey started from the lens of a value investor.</p><h4><strong>&#8220;What initially attracted you to that specific style? And other than your interest in (and proficiency for) tech, what was the catalyst for the switch towards growth investing (if that&#8217;s even how you would describe yourself)?&#8221;</strong></h4><blockquote><p><strong>Francis</strong></p></blockquote><p>I was attracted to value investing because in University I studied Business and Economics. I had a minor in Finance.</p><p>In business school, you are taught to use formulas and strict frameworks to measure and calculate a stock. I also got attracted to the comfort of owning low PE stocks, however, I observed that if you want to outperform and grow your portfolio, you have to be comfortable paying up for quality stocks that have great visibility into future growth.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><p>I would agree with that.</p><p>&#8230;</p><p>So, it&#8217;s been a pleasure to interact and learn from you on Twitter over the past year or so. I&#8217;ve always been amazed at the consistency and quality of your content.</p><h4><strong>&#8220;As an &#8216;economist by day&#8217; what drives you to contribute on your Substack, seeking Alpha and Twitter in your spare time? It seems like almost another full-time job!&#8221;</strong></h4><blockquote><p><strong>Francis</strong></p></blockquote><p>Throughout my life, I have always been someone who has been extremely curious about learning about what drives the world from a business perspective (sometimes curiosity got me in trouble!).&nbsp;</p><p>The inner drive for learning, teaching and writing is what motivates me to continue to develop all my platforms.</p><p>There is a magic to putting down a pen to paper.</p><p>As a result of my curiosity levels, I sometimes need to put my thoughts on paper to help me overcome overthinking. I enjoy researching businesses and writing helps bring clarity and structure to my thinking. This is primarily how all my platforms on Seeking Alpha, Substack and Thread writing became a passion outside of work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><p>This is similar to myself. Investing enables my curiosity.</p><p>Also, I agree that writing your thoughts down, even if not publishing them, is a brilliant way to synthesize the ideas in your head. Everyone should give it a go.</p><p>&#8230;</p><h4><strong>&#8220;Following on, do you have any plans with where you want to take your twitter/substack in the future?&#8221;</strong></h4><blockquote><p><strong>Francis</strong></p></blockquote><p>I really want to just focus on becoming a better investor and learn from the best.</p><p>I want to become better at understanding Enterprise SaaS, evolving my investment process and meeting great people in Investment business through my platforms. We will see how things evolve over time.</p><h2><strong>2. Investing Style</strong></h2><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><p>Moving on to your investing style. It seems we both have similar ideas when it comes to the type of companies we like to research (i.e. growth/technology).</p><h4><strong>&#8220;Firstly, how would you describe your investing style? And how would you say it has evolved over time?&#8221;</strong></h4><blockquote><p><strong>Francis</strong></p></blockquote><p>My Investing Style is honestly still a work-in-progress that is constantly evolving.&nbsp;</p><p>The image below is a simple breakdown of my current investing process and has helped me to be successful to-date.</p><p>The rubric below was developed based on my past decisions and what I expect of my future self. However, I am human. I don&#8217;t follow all my rules 100% of the time, but I always try my best to ensure I have a process in place that guides my decision-making rather than making my investing decisions on emotions or lack thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9037c9ff-08c5-47bc-a204-ab664001aabf_796x365.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9037c9ff-08c5-47bc-a204-ab664001aabf_796x365.png" width="796" height="365" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9037c9ff-08c5-47bc-a204-ab664001aabf_796x365.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:365,&quot;width&quot;:796,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9037c9ff-08c5-47bc-a204-ab664001aabf_796x365.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9037c9ff-08c5-47bc-a204-ab664001aabf_796x365.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9037c9ff-08c5-47bc-a204-ab664001aabf_796x365.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9037c9ff-08c5-47bc-a204-ab664001aabf_796x365.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><p>This framework is great. I think there are a couple of really interesting points here and a tone of things new investors could utilize.</p><p>Firstly, it highlights the idea that, in many ways, big parts of investing decisions can be subjective in nature. E.g. your opinion on management&#8217;s skillset may differ from someone elses. Or you may have a passion towards an area that someone else does not.</p><p>Therefore, sometimes it&#8217;s just a case of trusting your gut.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Francis</strong></p></blockquote><p>Evaluating Management is a difficult skill and it is subjective.</p><p>I generally try to evaluate quantitative metrics such as if the Founder or CEO has been part of successful businesses in the past, or their biggest accomplishments/setbacks in the past. These provide some clues to evaluate Management&#8217;s ability to execute.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><p>Also, I like the point about having the flexibility and experience to know when to bend your own rules. And that the underlying point in a good framework is to avoid the emotional decisions, which always turn out to be the worst.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Francis</strong></p></blockquote><p>Absolutely, It is constantly a balance. Balancing facts with intuition.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><h4><strong>&#8220;Next, do you have any main influences in terms of investing style? Also are there any quotes that stand out to you?&#8221;</strong></h4><blockquote><p><strong>Francis</strong></p></blockquote><p>Cathie Wood and Brad Gertsner at Altimeter Growth Capital played a role in influencing my decision in the early days. Peter Lynch has played a role in different areas.</p><p>In recent years, I have been influenced by people I&#8217;ve met on Twitter such as Individuals like Dennis Hong, friends on Twitter such as @StockNovice on Twitter and @Investing City.&nbsp;</p><p>My favourite quotes come from Peter Lynch:</p><ul><li><p><em>&#8220;Investing in stocks is an art, not a science, and people who've been trained to rigidly quantify everything have a big disadvantage.&#8221;</em>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><em>&#8220;Invest in what you know &amp; see around&#8221;</em></p></li><li><p><em>&#8220;Everyone has the brainpower to make money in stocks. Not everyone has the stomach.&#8221;</em></p></li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><p>Those are some great quotes.</p><h4><strong>&#8220;Another aspect of investment style which varies significantly person-to-person is strategy towards allocation and risk. Do you follow any specific rules around these aspects?&#8221;</strong></h4><blockquote><p><strong>Francis</strong></p></blockquote><p>Yes, I currently have a concentrated portfolio of about 10-names. I ensure I have a high-degree of confidence on my core names.</p><p>My Top 3-5 allocation are significantly allocated to the company where I have tremendous confidence in their future growth prospects relative to the current valuation. I want to always ensure I have more money towards my best risk-reward idea.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><p>To me, this is really interesting. I feel like 10 would be considered a fairly concentrated portfolio by many people&#8217;s standards.</p><p>There has been somewhat of a debate recently on twitter as to what the sweet spot is for portfolio size. Mine currently sits at about 18 which I am looking to cut down by at least 5 in the short-term.</p><p>How do you weigh up this balance between portfolio growth and diversification?

Research</strong></h2><p>&#8230;</p><p>Regarding the research process - a question I get asked fairly often is how I pick the companies I end up analysing in the deep-dives. For me it&#8217;s all about mixing my passions/interests with my investing process.</p><p>E.g. My interests revolve around immersive tech, entertainment and gaming - which is why some of my most enjoyable work-to-date has been linked to these areas.</p><h4><strong>&#8220;Does this hold true for yourself? Do you have any particular areas of interest you particularly like to focus on?&#8221;</strong></h4><blockquote><p><strong>Francis</strong></p></blockquote><p>Yes, I agree. If you plan to invest in a company for a decade. You will have to be a part of the story and the product. Hence, if you don&#8217;t have any interest or passion for the topic, you&#8217;ll find it hard to keep up, study a company in depth and develop a necessary edge.</p><p>I combine my past work experience and my passion for technology to study these areas. I feel that due to my experience, interest and network, I have my own personal edge in analyzing these sectors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><h4><strong>&#8220;Similar to the previous question, are there any industries or technologies you would keep an eye on in the next 5-10 years?&#8221;</strong></h4><p>I know you focus a good amount on the creator/gig economy along with big-data &#8211; so I&#8217;d be keen to hear what you think some important trends will be over the next decade.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Francis</strong></p></blockquote><p>The world has drastically changed both during the pandemic as well as the fact we are gradually exiting/learning to live with Covid. As a result, I believe there will be a significant spending/tailwind within the Enterprise SaaS Technology market compared to the consumer B2C.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the biggest habits that changed the world was employees and companies learning to work remotely. As a result, many changes have had to occur at the Enterprise level.&nbsp;</p><p>I personally believe Enterprise SaaS platforms areas such as Cybersecurity, Data Analytics Platforms/ML Tools for insights, Collaboration tools, On-Prem to Cloud Transitions will see major growth.</p><p>Some other key sectors include the rise of the Gig-economy/Freelancing and Fintech (Buy-Now-Pay-Later),</p><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><p>Thanks Francis. More into the nitty gritty &#8211; I think it&#8217;s interesting how there is almost never one &#8216;correct&#8217; opinion when it comes to analyzing a company (especially on twitter). We all think we&#8217;re right, until we&#8217;re not.</p><h4><strong>&#8220;Do you have any particular attributes or heuristics you look for in a good investment?&#8221;</strong></h4><p>For me, good management, underlying revenue growth and a clear path to profitability are core aspects.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Francis</strong></p></blockquote><p>Accelerating Revenue Growth (Year-over-Year) and (Quarter-over-Quarter) with a decline in operating expenses, Steady Dollar-Based Net Retention and customer stickiness are strong signals.</p><p>If you combine these metrics with a company that has a leading market share together with a management team that has shown they can execute - you can find a big winner.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>4. Quickfire</strong></h2><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><p>Linking to the above question, an influx of new investors has seen other asset classes, such as crypto, take off recently.</p><h4><strong>&#8220;As a tech-focused investor with a main focus on equities, do you have any plans to learn about these new asset classes? Does this area of technology interest you at all?"</strong></h4><blockquote><p><strong>Francis</strong></p></blockquote><p>I have a decent amount of investments into both major Cryptocurrencies - Ethereum and Bitcoin. A slight more allocation towards Ethereum because this platform has a lot more use-cases for the next era of decentralized finance.</p><p>My overall thesis is that finance is going to be more digital over the next decade and secondly, the next disruption in finance will create decentralized parties.</p><p>The major cryptocurrencies will all play a major role.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><p>Looking at the creator economy from the perspective of a creator &#8211; you have covered the Upwork vs Fiverr debate in considerable detail.</p><h4><strong>&#8220;I&#8217;m curious, do you see the creator economy continuing to grow over the coming years? Or do you think we will revert back to pre-pandemic ways of working?&#8221;</strong></h4><blockquote><p><strong>Francis</strong></p></blockquote><p>Holistically, two major themes have occurred during Covid.&nbsp; Employers are facing a massive labour shortage especially in North America. And secondly, the content creator economy has exploded as a result of more people working from home and internalizing their future goals.&nbsp; Platforms like Substack have been successful in Covid.&nbsp;</p><p>Upwork has a robust business model that matches both aspects of the market.&nbsp; Upwork has a more experienced, award-winning Enterprise-focused business that has been ranked as one of the best in the industry that is helping companies manage the labour shortage issue (thread below).</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/InvestiAnalyst/status/1428486221747998724?s=20&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;My Investment Thesis on the Rise of The Gig and Freelance Work Economy. \n\nThe contrarian reason I chose $UPWK over $FVRR. \n\nFull Thread Below: &quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;InvestiAnalyst&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Francis - Analyst&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Thu Aug 19 22:37:09 +0000 2021&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[{&quot;img_url&quot;:&quot;https://pbs.substack.com/media/E9MApI3UUAEyaTN.png&quot;,&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;https://t.co/NktR2S1rlF&quot;,&quot;alt_text&quot;:null}],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:54,&quot;like_count&quot;:188,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null}"><a href="https://twitter.com/InvestiAnalyst/status/1428486221747998724?s=20" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-user-avatar" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/twitter_name/w_36/InvestiAnalyst.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @InvestiAnalyst"><span class="tweet-author-name">Francis - Analyst </span><span class="tweet-author">@InvestiAnalyst</span></div>My Investment Thesis on the Rise of The Gig and Freelance Work Economy.

Their entire business model is anti-fragile and resilient because they have multiple revenue streams. They are one of the leading staffing platforms in the US.&nbsp;</p><p>On the financial aspect, their revenue has been accelerating. On Upwork&#8217;s growth, new management team and the current tailwinds, they are a business that can generate significant returns as their multiple re-rates. Upwork has a much better business economics to capitalize on this structural shift.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><p>Since the pandemic, many new investors have entered the market.</p><h4><strong>&#8220;If you had to give one piece of advice to someone who has just started investing, what would it be?&#8221;</strong></h4><blockquote><p><strong>Francis</strong></p></blockquote><p>Constantly learn. Streamline your information process. Importantly, be open to new information/data. It is very easy to become attached to a company, but it is particularly essential to detach yourself from a company&#8217;s stock and the underlying business.&nbsp;</p><p>My biggest advice is to know what you own. Don&#8217;t be in a hurry to make money. Be obsessed about playing the long-game. Focus on improving your investment process rather than always focusing on results, but importantly back-test this process to ensure that you are getting the results long-term. If not, course correct. Don&#8217;t be afraid to think outside the box.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><p>I love this answer. Every new investor should be taking notes.</p><p>Being objective and long-term oriented is key.</p><h4><strong>&#8220;Could you explain what you mean by &#8216;streamline your information process&#8217;? How does this look in reality?&#8221;</strong></h4><blockquote><p><strong>Francis</strong></p></blockquote><p>I believe the quality of information and evidence that an investor uses to analyze and guide their portfolio decision-making process is essential.</p><p>In reality, I study the most successful Investors that have consistently outperformed the market then I curate my social media feed using Twitter Lists to specifically track their moves/what they say.</p><p>Secondly, if its a hedge-fund, read their posts/blogs eg. Altimeter Growth Corp Hedge Fund.</p><p>Lastly, trying to identify the #1-3 top metrics that moves the needle for a company and focus solely on tracking those metrics and ignore short-term noise. The goal is to constantly filter your information sources.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><p>I often find I learn far more from my mistakes than I do my wins.</p><h4><strong>&#8220;What is your biggest investing mistake? And what did you learn from it?&#8221;</strong></h4><blockquote><p><strong>Francis</strong></p></blockquote><p>My biggest investing mistake was holding on too long to a company that was underperforming.</p><p>I can share the company, it is called &#8220;TWOU.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>I kept placing my &#8216;hope&#8217; that the company would turn things around because it was undervalued. I was stubborn, refused to be open to new information and I only wanted to listen to information that was confirmed by my world-view and personal thesis. I held on to the losing stock for a long-time and my opportunity cost was particularly high because I missed out on the returns on other better stocks in 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a good lesson that taught me to be open to new information. I also learned that sometimes cheap valuations generally mean there is something wrong. Companies are cheap for a reason and the market is somewhat efficient in its pricing, so be cautious because opportunity cost can be high in the wrong stock.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally,&nbsp; It also made me realize that in some cases, I have to be willing to pay up for high-quality companies with great visibility into their future growth and business prospects.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><h4><strong>&#8220;If you had $100K which you were forced to invest now between 3 stocks (weighted equally) over the next 10 years, which 3 stocks would you choose? And a short sentence on why.&#8221;</strong></h4><blockquote><p><strong>Francis</strong></p></blockquote><ol><li><p><strong>Upstart:</strong> Founder-Led, flawless GTM sales motion that is leading to triple-digit revenue growth while highly-profitable with over 30% EBITDA margin and they are disrupting a&nbsp; niche category in a large lending market.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Affirm:</strong> They have key partnerships with the Top 4 eCommerce companies in the US (Amazon, Walmart, Target and Shopify) in a Buy-Now-Pay-Later market that is only less than 5% penetrated in North America. They have a massive competitive advantage in their brand and underwriting risk. They are led by a seasoned entrepreneur, the ex CTO/Founder of Paypal.</p></li><li><p><strong>Palantir:</strong> They are the leading company in the world positioning to capture a large market opportunity in the race for Artificial Intelligence across 10-industry sectors. Primarily because they have built the most sophisticated vertically-integrated AI tech stack that covers every area of AI. They are led by incredibly talented Founders.</p></li></ol><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><h4><strong>Finally, do you have any books or podcasts you would recommend to new-ish investors?</strong></h4><blockquote><p><strong>Francis</strong></p></blockquote><p>I listen to many non-fiction books. However, for Investing, my best advice has been listening to great podcasts, shows and interviews with investors who are well-respected.</p><p>My favourites are Invest Like The Best and Colossus Podcast by Patrick O'Shaughnessy are some of my best podcasts. </p><iframe class="spotify-wrap podcast" data-attrs="{&quot;image&quot;:&quot;https://i.scdn.co/image/d6c7ea2971ef690e93cf25dddd3cb520719f1d78&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Invest Like the Best with Patrick O'Shaughnessy&quot;,&quot;subtitle&quot;:&quot;By Colossus&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Podcast&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.spotify.com/show/22fi0RqfoBACCuQDv97wFO&quot;}" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/show/22fi0RqfoBACCuQDv97wFO" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe><p>I would suggest that people focus on listening to great Podcast from successful investors such as Pat Dorsey that analyze real-world companies and get practical hands-on experience trying out things in the market. </p><p>Investing is not black and white, it has a mix of the arts and sciences.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Innovestor</strong></p></blockquote><p>Brilliant - and that&#8217;s it for the questions.</p><p>Thank-you, Francis, for your time today. And no doubt we will speak again soon.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Francis</strong></p></blockquote><p>Thank you so much for the opportunity to do this interview. I want to wish everyone the best.

It simply isn&#8217;t possible for a humans to thrive in an environment without having ways to simplify complex decision making problems. Heuristics have been helpful in our evolution as a species, and are more common in some industries compared to others (such as finance).</p><p>In Finance, we use heuristics all the time. </p><p>Below, I have put together a list of 16 rules I commonly refer back to in order to help with focus. I would love to hear any additions you have. </p><h3>Rule #1 - Look for skin in the game wherever possible</h3><p><a href="https://innovestor.substack.com/p/skin-in-the-game">I&#8217;ve previously written an article focusing on the importance of &#8216;Skin in the game&#8217;</a>. It explores its importance to both investors and the businesses they invest in.</p><p>Skin in the game is two-pronged - from the investors point of view it&#8217;s crucial to have skin in the game in order to have the motivation to learn and really &#8216;feel&#8217; the emotions when investing in a company. There is no substitute. </p><p>From a businesses point of view, having a management team with strong ties to the company (be that a founder or good insider ownership) is a surefire route to success. Passion is hard to substitute.</p><p>I love this quote from Steve Jobs, outlining why having skin in the game is crucial.</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;I think that without owning something over an extended period of time (several years), where one has a chance to take responsibility for one's recommendations. Where one has to see one's recommendations through all action stages and accumulate scar tissue for the mistakes, and pick oneself up off the ground, and dust oneself off&#8230; one learns a fraction of what one can.&#8221;</em></p><p><em>&#8220;When you're coming in and making recommendations and not owning the results, not owning the implementation&#8230; I think (you get) a fraction of the value and a fraction of the opportunity to learn and get better. You do get a broad cut at companies, but it's very thin. It's like a picture of banana &#8211; you might get a very accurate picture, but it's only two-dimensional. And without the experience of actually doing it, you never get three-dimensional. So you might have a lot of pictures on your walls. You can show off to your friends like &#8216;I've worked in bananas, I've worked in peaches, I've worked in grapes&#8230;&#8217; etc. but you never really taste it.&#8221; - </em><strong>Steve Jobs</strong></p></blockquote><div id="youtube2-4n6LrehCPOQ" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;4n6LrehCPOQ&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4n6LrehCPOQ?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><h3>Rule #2 - Embrace being uncomfortable</h3><blockquote><p><em>"In investing, what is comfortable is rarely profitable."</em> &#8212; <strong>Robert Arnott</strong></p></blockquote><p>Learning can often be uncomfortable at first.

It gives us a false sense of security - numbing us to the reality of a situation. We justify this to ourselves with the idea that the majority of people are usually right. And even if they&#8217;re wrong, at least I haven&#8217;t made a fool out of myself.</p><p>History is riddled with people following crowds - in wars, election cycles, ideologies, religion.

What makes this even harder is that most aspects of life fall into a grey area.</p><blockquote><p><em>"Belonging is one of the things that makes life bearable, and it can be tough to look at a binary world and choose against both sides</em>." - <strong>Andrew Solomon</strong></p></blockquote><p>Humans are complex animals - and, by extension, operate in a complex societal structure where there is almost never a simple yes/no or good/bad answer. This fact therefore requires us to ask questions almost constantly in order to rationalise the world around us.</p><p>In an attempt to combat this all too prevalent trap, my strategy is to investigate both sides of the argument with equal weight and (as much as I can) equal prejudice. Doing so often deepens my understanding on the topic as a whole and leads to better decision making.</p><h3>Rule #5 - Remember, the retail investor always comes last</h3><p>This rule isn&#8217;t meant to sound as pessimistic as it does. However it is a fact that you and I, as retail investors, are subject to the whims of the broader financial market. This market includes powerful and influential hedge funds and institutional investors with whom you are playing this game against.</p><p>One example of this is the IPO price retail investors receive compared to the price institutional investors receive. Late last year Airbnb IPOd to institutional investors at roughly $68 and shortly shot up to about $146 which was the only price available to retail investors.&nbsp;</p><h3>Rule #6 - Tune out the noise</h3><p><a href="https://innovestor.substack.com/p/skin-in-the-game">This article from Conor titled &#8216;Reflections on noise&#8217;</a> is a brilliant overview on the topic.</p><p>The modern world is overloaded with information - some valuable, but most is almost worthless.

Compounding can be the difference between a good portfolio return and a great one.</p><p>&#8220;Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it. He who doesn&#8217;t, pays it&#8221; - <strong>Albert Einstein</strong></p><h3>Rule #13 - Buy what you know.</h3><p>It&#8217;s incredibly tempting to buy into a company/technology without fully understanding how it works.</p><p>Putting in the time to truly understand why you are investing in any given asset is key.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>"There is nothing wrong with a 'know nothing' investor who realizes it. The problem is when you are a 'know nothing' investor but you think you know something."</em> <strong>- Warren Buffett</strong></p></blockquote><p>Most will have spent their careers working in no more than a handful of industries, therefore we should have a good grasp on how these particular industries work. However, this leaves the majority of publicly traded companies to be outside of our circle of competence.</p><p>It&#8217;s not to say you should flat-out stay away from these areas, but apply caution and look for &#8216;experts&#8217;.</p><h3>Rule #14 - If in doubt, zoom out.</h3><p>Taking a step back from a situation or idea can give you some much needed context. As with most of life, context is key. We often get bogged down in the details or the short-term story whilst ignoring the long-term vision.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d062f8f-c686-4e63-908c-314897be46e2_1600x818.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d062f8f-c686-4e63-908c-314897be46e2_1600x818.jpeg" width="576" height="294.3296703296703" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3d062f8f-c686-4e63-908c-314897be46e2_1600x818.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:744,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:576,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d062f8f-c686-4e63-908c-314897be46e2_1600x818.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d062f8f-c686-4e63-908c-314897be46e2_1600x818.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d062f8f-c686-4e63-908c-314897be46e2_1600x818.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d062f8f-c686-4e63-908c-314897be46e2_1600x818.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h3>Rule #15 - There is never a perfect time to invest</h3><p>&#8220;The Best Time To Invest Was Yesterday, The Second Best Time Is Today.&#8221;</p><p>This is one of the biggest mistakes I see new investors making, and within a year they almost always wish they had started investing as soon as possible.</p><p>Start today.

Introduction</h2><p>With the rise of the internet in its many forms over the past two decades, we have seen more and more vulnerabilities arise. To be frank, the early internet wasn&#8217;t built with the intention to connect the entire world. The first instance of the internet was more intended for sharing between military and academic networks. As the internet grew in reach and scale, as did the vulnerabilities.</p><p>By mid-way through the 2000&#8217;s it was clear that legacy solutions to combating intrusive malware was insufficient compared to the rate at which it was being produced. In essence, legacy cybersecurity was<strong> reactive rather than proactive</strong>. Therefore, the attackers were always two steps ahead.</p><p>Oftentimes, it takes something to go wrong before we feel the need to address the problem. The preventative nature of security goes somewhat against human psychology. In business, this phenomenon manifests in companies' reluctance to invest sufficient capital into protecting themselves from cyber threats.</p><p>With an increase in attacks over the years, the business world is beginning to take the matter more seriously. Sensitive data-leaks can bring a business to its knees.</p><p>That&#8217;s where Crowdstrike comes in.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><h2>2. Thesis</h2><p>In a world becoming increasingly reliant on digital solutions to digital problems, the Cybersecurity industry will become more and more important. In fact, cybersecurity will be essential. Businesses operating without a top cybersecurity solution will suffer.</p><p>Crowdstrike, with their best-in-class, innovative, cybersecurity solution are well positioned within a fast growing and absolutely necessary industry. Their desirable modular product suite combined with their current state of &#8216;hypergrowth&#8217; sets them up to be one of the most influential Endpoint Protection Cybersecurity companies over the coming 3-5 years.</p><p>Even considering the currently lofty valuation, Crowdstrike are in-line with many of the top SaaS and high-growth peers - this is taking into account that most other businesses aren&#8217;t growing their baseline revenue at the rates of Crowdstrike.</p><p>Crowdstrike are in the perfect position to capitalize on an industry crying out for disruption, leveraging their first-mover advantage, network effects and strong management.</p><div><hr></div><h2>3. Key terminology</h2><p>Before we get into the meat of the article I think it&#8217;s worthwhile outlining some of the key terms as, most likely, you will be approaching this company from a similar starting point to myself.</p><h3>3.1. Endpoint</h3><p>Any physical device that can be connected to a network. E.g. Laptops, desktops, mobile phones, tablets, servers, and virtual environments can all be considered endpoints.</p><p>Endpoints started off being relatively few and far between (e.g. personal computers). However as technology has developed, the variety of endpoints has continued to climb. Therefore, endpoint security is becoming more and more valuable.&nbsp;</p><h3>3.2. Malware &amp; Virus</h3><p>Malware is a catch-all term for any type of malicious software, regardless of how it works, its intent, or how it&#8217;s distributed. A virus is a specific type of malware that self-replicates by inserting its code into other programs.&nbsp;</p><p>Each type of virus has hundreds and thousands of variations and iterations, thereby making it hard to find each new instance.</p><p>The virus, at its core, executes a process (e.g. opening a program, closing a program, sending an email). These processes result in patterns which CrowdStrike systems can locate, identify as an attack, and nullify.</p><p>Interestingly, as well as having many variations, viruses can access your system in many different ways - e.g. social engineering, phishing, spear phishing and many more. The social engineering aspect is possibly the most interesting/vulnerable aspect. As with many other things, human nature remains the fundamental weakness.</p><h3>3.3. IOC vs IOA</h3><p>An IoC (Indicator of compromise) is a post-infection indicator. This means after a virus has been installed into a target system, the antivirus program scans files and documents for known virus signatures (like we do with the PCR tests and Covid-19) and then quarantines the files and deletes them.</p><p>You may have seen this before with programs like McCafee, where they scan and incubate.&nbsp;</p><p>That's not what CrowdStrike specializes in. CrowdStrike focuses on IoA (indicators of Attack). IoA scans for suspicious processes that are started in the background by malicious files. <strong>Simply put, you can think of IoC as a &#8216;reactive&#8217; method of protection whereas IOAs is a &#8216;preventative&#8217; method of protection - stopping the virus before it can reach do anything harmful.</strong></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8a76bb1-6589-4ff8-9cb6-e2f0872280e7_612x184.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8a76bb1-6589-4ff8-9cb6-e2f0872280e7_612x184.png" width="612" height="184" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c8a76bb1-6589-4ff8-9cb6-e2f0872280e7_612x184.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:184,&quot;width&quot;:612,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8a76bb1-6589-4ff8-9cb6-e2f0872280e7_612x184.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8a76bb1-6589-4ff8-9cb6-e2f0872280e7_612x184.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8a76bb1-6589-4ff8-9cb6-e2f0872280e7_612x184.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8a76bb1-6589-4ff8-9cb6-e2f0872280e7_612x184.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><div><hr></div><h3>4. History</h3><ul><li><p>In 1987 McAfee launched its first antivirus solution which was followed by Symantec&#8217;s antivirus solution in 1991.</p></li><li><p>by 2007, roughly 5.5 million malware samples were identified in that year alone.</p></li><li><p>By 2013 400,000 new malware samples were being reported every day. From this point onwards, it was clear something within the industry needed to change. Cybersecurity needed to become preventative rather than reactive.</p></li><li><p>Several years later, in 2011, George Kurtz (the CTO of Mcafee at the time) pitched the idea of CrowdStrike to &#8216;Warburg Pincus&#8217; (a private equity firm) on a Saturday morning via Skype. They instantly gave him $25M in seed money, and by the sounds of it were willing to give him as much as he needed. This small anecdote speaks volumes of the conviction the private equity firm had in George (we&#8217;ll cover this in more detail later).&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>George previously established Foundstone, a security firm that was eventually bought by McAfee in 2004. He has previously held key positions in the cybersecurity area at Ernst &amp; Young and PriceWaterhouseCooper. He graduated from Seton Hall University with a degreein Accounting. As of April 2020, George owned 22.4 percent of Crowdstrike.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;My light-bulb moment for CrowdStrike happened when I was on a plane. I noticed a passenger take out his laptop and turn it on. McAfee software popped up and started to scan the man's machine. The guy was waiting for 15 minutes. He was waiting and waiting and I was just sitting there, the CTO of the company that makes the technology. I realized there must be a better solution.</em></p><p><em>That's when Dmitri Alperovitch, who was the vice president of threat research at McAfee at the time, and Gregg Marston and I decided to build a security company entirely on the cloud. CrowdStrike became the first native cloud security solution, which means that it's lightweight and nimble and doesn't slow down the user's machine.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><ul><li><p>With the help from his two co-founders, Dmitri Alperovitch &amp; Gregg Marston, they built the company into one of the fastest growing and most innovative cybersecurity companies in the world.</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2>5. What is Crowdstrike and how does it work?</h2><h3>5.1. At a glance</h3><p>CrowdStrike is a cloud-based antivirus company with the aim of stopping the cyber attack before it can execute on the target device (or &#8216;endpoint&#8217;). In terms of scale, and where they want to eventually reach, they make comparisons to some of the other big cloud players - such as Salesforce, Servicenow and Workday.

This is a far cry from the incumbent solutions which are slow-moving and lack flexibility.</p><h3>5.3. Why CrowdStrike&#8217;s solution is better than legacy IT Cybersecurity</h3><p>Typically, legacy IT infrastructure does not scale well as the number of endpoints (users, phones, laptops etc.) scales up. Typically, the more endpoints there are, the more a company must spend to secure them.</p><p>New threats also means new solutions need to be installed on EVERY end-point - thereby bloating up the system. A real life example of this many of us can relate to is the difference in speed between a new work laptop and an old one. The work PC starts off quick and responsive, however as more and more malware protection is added on by your organisation over the years, the slower it gets. CrowdStrike solves this problem.</p><p>CrowdStrike is Cloud-Native, which means the product is scalable, adaptable, and benefits from network effects.</p><p>Additionally, and possibly the most &#8216;next-gen&#8217; aspect of the product is the use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. With each new &#8216;attack&#8217; on the system, the AI/ML algorithm uses this data to helps to strengthen the overall network by feeding that information back into the system, helping it to learn. This new method is classed as &#8216;Next Gen Anti-Virus&#8217; (NGAV).</p><p>So, put simply, the more customers Crowdstrike have - the better the end product is due to the addition of data points it has to draw from. This is know as &#8216;network effects&#8217; and is extremely powerful.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9bbedeb2-92c9-4d18-bcac-3ea8c8fc5da1_1321x434.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9bbedeb2-92c9-4d18-bcac-3ea8c8fc5da1_1321x434.png" width="1321" height="434" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9bbedeb2-92c9-4d18-bcac-3ea8c8fc5da1_1321x434.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:434,&quot;width&quot;:1321,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9bbedeb2-92c9-4d18-bcac-3ea8c8fc5da1_1321x434.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9bbedeb2-92c9-4d18-bcac-3ea8c8fc5da1_1321x434.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9bbedeb2-92c9-4d18-bcac-3ea8c8fc5da1_1321x434.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9bbedeb2-92c9-4d18-bcac-3ea8c8fc5da1_1321x434.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>One slight downside of Crowdstrike from an investor&#8217;s point of view is the complexity of the business. Without a background in IT or Cyber, this company is tricky to fully understand. This, in my opinion, makes building conviction hard.&nbsp;</p><p>That being said, once you can begin to understand the core business, it&#8217;s easy to see why the business model is effective and disruptive. And that mainly boils down to the laser-focus on the experience of the end user.</p><h3>5.4. Pricing</h3><p>There are four main pricing options on the Crowdstrike platform - Falcon Pro, Falcon Enterprise, Falcon Premium and Falcon Complete.</p><p>&#8220;some of the legacy vendors in this space had hundreds of thousands of enterprise customers. The key to our rapidly expanding customer base is that we are winning customers of all sizes.

However, one could argue they have the superior product. The question is, will the buyers recognise the importance of having the best protection in this day and age?</p><p>One breach for a company nowadays could be catastrophic.</p><p>With the increase in high-profile security breaches over the past couple of years, I believe consumers and enterprises will com to realise this fact.</p><p>In addition to the modular option pricing (above) Crowdstrike also offers incident response and forensic investigatory services, technical assessment and strategic advisory services, as well as training to assist organizations that have experienced a breach or are assessing their security posture and ability to respond to breaches. These are listed as <strong>professional services</strong> and make up roughly 7% of total revenues (down from ~30% 5 years ago) and is a much lower margin business (35% gross margin compared to the the 76% gross margin on the subscription business).</p><p>That being said, these professional services are a great onboarding tool, as when customers encounter problems and begin to trust that Crowdstrike knows what they are talking about - then upselling modular assistance is made 10X easier.</p><p>As an example...</p><blockquote><p><strong>From the recent annual report</strong> - <em>&#8220;After experiencing the benefits of our platform firsthand, many of our incident response customers become subscription customers. Among organizations who first became a customer after February 1, 2019, for each $1.00 spent by those customers on their initial engagement for our incident response or proactive services, as of January 31, 2021, we derived an average of $5.51 in ARR from those subscription contracts.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><h3>5.5. Why is Crowdstrike Unique?</h3><p>Crowdstrike is a pioneer of technologies and new ways of tackling problems within the cybersecurity industry. Their product is unique in several different ways - and here&#8217;s why.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Single lightweight agent: </strong>To simplify, in order for an antivirus system to work on your computer/device, you need to install what is called an &#8216;agent&#8217;. This &#8216;agent&#8217; can be thought of simply as a programme on your PC.</p></li></ol><p>Typically, for the &#8216;old-gen&#8217; cybersecurity companies they would install several &#8216;agents&#8217;, all with different uses. The downside would be increased programmes running on your PC, therefore slowing it down significantly.&nbsp;</p><p>In comparison, Crowdstrike is able to solve this problem by installing one single &#8216;agent&#8217; which does all the work locally on your device, then streams data back to the cloud-based Falcon platform for real-time decision making.</p><ol start="2"><li><p><strong>Artificial Intelligence &amp; Machine Learning: </strong>Essentially, Crowdstrike&#8217;s use of machine learning via a distributed cloud architecture means that if one person experience a specific data-breach/attack, the AI/ML system will &#8216;learn&#8217; - therefore protecting everyone else on the network from the same attack.</p></li></ol><blockquote><p><em><strong>&#8220;</strong>CrowdStrike Threat Graph is the brains behind the Falcon endpoint protection platform. Threat Graph predicts and prevents modern threats in real time through the industry's most comprehensive sets of endpoint telemetry, threat intelligence and AI-powered analytics.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><p>With AI, a typical method of &#8216;training&#8217; is to feed it other examples of known &#8216;attacks&#8217; so the AI has a better knowledge of what it looks like. Just like us Humans learn by input and confirmation over the duration of our lives, computer AI systems learn by recognising patterns in data.</p><p>A great, simple, example of this principle is the story of teaching AI systems what animals look like. To us, it&#8217;s easy to identify a dog or a cat and the obvious distinction between the two. However, this kind of image recognition is far harder for computers. In order to learn - an AI system must learn by looking at other pictures of dogs and cats.</p><p>So, if the AI sees a pattern, it can correlate that pattern with a &#8216;learned&#8217; virus/breech.</p><p>This model, which uses real-life examples to train the system, has the ability to scale-up by using the cloud.</p><ol start="3"><li><p><strong>Cloud architecture: </strong>As mentioned above, the nature of Crowdstrike&#8217;s cloud-based architecture offers many advantages to both the end user and the company.</p></li></ol><p>Once the lightweight agent is on the end-user&#8217;s system, the cloud-based system can update modules in real-time. Whereas non-cloud-based models would require the user to upload each new module to their system - taking significant time and effort. This makes selling the platform easy.</p><p>Adding to this, the cloud infrastructure is fairly &#8216;lean&#8217; in that costs are significantly reduced without the need for complex physical IT infrastructure and the various costs associated with that.</p><h3>5.6. Modules - a key driver of success</h3><p>As mentioned briefly earlier, one of the key drivers of Crowdstrike&#8217;s success is the constant addition of modules.</p><p>This can be shown below from the table below, highlighting as the number of modules increased from 2017 (assuming roughly 15 modules) to 2021 (19 modules) - the number of subscribers with over 4 or more modules increased from 0% to 66% as of Q2 2022.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8cb29916-a4f8-4226-93df-d515ee59a2f5_747x127.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8cb29916-a4f8-4226-93df-d515ee59a2f5_747x127.png" width="747" height="127" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8cb29916-a4f8-4226-93df-d515ee59a2f5_747x127.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:127,&quot;width&quot;:747,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8cb29916-a4f8-4226-93df-d515ee59a2f5_747x127.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8cb29916-a4f8-4226-93df-d515ee59a2f5_747x127.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8cb29916-a4f8-4226-93df-d515ee59a2f5_747x127.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8cb29916-a4f8-4226-93df-d515ee59a2f5_747x127.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The plan seems to be to keep integrating additional modules (organically or via acquisition) whilst increasing the ease of discoverability for end users to find and try these new modules via the Crowdstrike store.</p><p><em>&#8220;We launched the CrowdStrike Store, the first open cloud-based application PaaS for cybersecurity, which provides an ecosystem of trusted partners and applications for our customers.

This business model works well in cybersecurity, because (generally) cybersecurity solutions are very sticky - traditionally due to the high switching costs.</p><p>There is, however, a fine balance between focusing on increasing the number of modules per subscriber and getting new customers through the door, which is something management has mentioned in the annual reports.</p><blockquote><p>That being said, in the most recent call George Kurz CEO cited an increase in new customers signing up to multiple modules - <em>&#8220;this new CrowdStrike customer was eager to transform the security posture and adopted 11 Falcon modules, including Falcon Complete, Discover, Spotlight, Falcon X Recon, Cloud Workload Protection, and Falcon Zero Trust to proactively secure and fully manage their workstations, cloud workloads, and identity layer, as well as provide visibility into their IT assets and vulnerabilities.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><h3>Summary</h3><p>To summarize this section, it&#8217;s clear that the advantage Crowdstrike has over the incumbent Cybersecurity players is the cloud architecture which combines with the single light agent and constantly evolving AI/ML algorithms. This combination allows the sales process to happen seamlessly, whilst also providing better proactive protection for the end user.</p><p>A study by Gartner showed that almost half of the enterprises surveyed indicated that they want to consolidate their security vendors in the next 2-3 years.</p><div><hr></div><h2>6. Cybersecurity - trend or necessity?</h2><p>With the digital age we&#8217;re currently living in, the core services&#8217; a business needs inevitably changes. For example, and it&#8217;s not apples for apples, but every business nowadays needs someone (or a team) to look after the social media aspect - this did not exist 15-20 years ago. Similarly, with the increased use of &#8216;digital&#8217;, every company needs to protect themselves from malicious cyber attacks. Simply, if you don&#8217;t have all your bases covered with cyber security, then the business will suffer. Therefore, Cyber is an absolute must in this day and age.</p><h3>6.1. The industry</h3><p>According to the most recent investor presentation, the total addressable market sits at <strong>$36.5B for 2021</strong> with the potential to increase to <strong>$43.6B by 2023</strong>. Future growth in this total addressable market is likely to be fueled by emerging areas such as cloud, IoT and home office/remote working solutions.</p><p>For me, this TAM can be broken down into three overarching drivers&#8230;</p><p><strong>1.

Growing to fill the TAM</h3><p>It&#8217;s all well and good having a nice big TAM (total addressable market), however if there is no sign the company has any intention of growing into the TAM then it doesn&#8217;t mean much.</p><p>So, what do Crowdstrike have planned in order to expand into the broader TAM?</p><h4><strong>Acquisitions</strong></h4><p>The most obvious solution to overcome the slowdown of organic growth (coming from the place of a healthy balance sheet) is to acquire companies that fit the brief.</p><p>It&#8217;s going to be a real question-mark as to whether they can move beyond their core competency successfully. Many businesses struggle. It takes extra resources and solving problems in a whole new area.</p><p>I believe Crowdstrike understands the need to acquire in order to grow. They have shown this over the past year with several acquisitions:</p><ul><li><p>Preempt Security for $90M (sept 2020) - real time access control and threat prevention</p></li><li><p>Humio for $400M (March 2021) - cloud-based data logging company</p></li></ul><p>I would expect to see more of this over the coming years.</p><p>Other short-to-medium term growth strategies outlined in the annual report include:</p><ul><li><p>Grow customer base by replacing legacy and other endpoint security products</p></li><li><p>Upselling/penetrating existing customers</p></li><li><p>Leveraging the Falcon platform to enter into new markets</p></li><li><p>Broadening into new customer segments</p></li><li><p>Extending the Falcon platform and Ecosystem</p></li><li><p>Broadening reach into the U.S. Federal Government Vertical</p></li><li><p>Expanding into new international territories</p></li></ul><h3>6.3. The Competition</h3><p>Cybersecurity is a cutthroat business with a fast-changing technical environment.</p><p>Some key endpoint competitors include SentinelOne, VMware, Trend Micro, Fortinet and Carbon Black - just to name a few. They also compete with antivirus solution providers such as McAfee, Kaspersky, Microsoft, and others, as well as network security companies such as Palo Alto Networks and FireEye.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d4c4c0b-5263-49f4-88d3-380f4cb44222_1200x1200.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d4c4c0b-5263-49f4-88d3-380f4cb44222_1200x1200.jpeg" width="1200" height="1200" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4d4c4c0b-5263-49f4-88d3-380f4cb44222_1200x1200.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1200,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d4c4c0b-5263-49f4-88d3-380f4cb44222_1200x1200.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d4c4c0b-5263-49f4-88d3-380f4cb44222_1200x1200.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d4c4c0b-5263-49f4-88d3-380f4cb44222_1200x1200.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d4c4c0b-5263-49f4-88d3-380f4cb44222_1200x1200.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The above &#8216;Magic Quadrants&#8217; graph from <a href="http://blog.51sec.org/2018/02/gartner-magic-quadrant-for-endpoint.html">Gartner </a>outlines the main competitive landscape within the Cybersecurity industry, focusing on &#8216;completeness of vision&#8217; and &#8216;ability to execute&#8217;. From it, we can clearly see the velocity with which Crowdstrike has risen to be a market leader over the past few years in a still VERY crowded market.</p><p>Despite the fierce competition within the market, Crowdstrike have been eating up market share over the past couple of years.<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200702005456/en/Worldwide-Endpoint-Security-Software-Market-Shares-Report-Reveals-CrowdStrike-is-Shaping-the-Endpoint-Market"> According to research</a>, the company increased their market-share by about 99% whilst the incumbent top 3 solutions share of the market decreased in 2018/19.</p><p>This is all in the context of being one of the more expensive solutions in the market alongside the majority of payments being up-front, which further goes to demonstrate the company&#8217;s pricing power.</p><p>CrowdStrike was the first to identify and handle the growing security demands of the cloud age, thus it benefited from a first-mover advantage. At the moment, it records 3 trillion endpoint-related events every week in real-time.</p><p>One thing you may notice from the above graphic is the closeness in competitive nature between Microsoft and Crowdstrike. At first glance it may seem like Crowdstrike could be up against stiff competition, however George Kurtz disagrees.</p><blockquote><p>Speaking about Microsoft and the risk of having the same Operating System and Security System - <em>&#8220;And, you know, there has been a lot of talk, again, at the audit committee around risk in a monoculture. And customers are becoming more and more uncomfortable with putting their eggs in one basket. So, you know, I think we have a great opportunity there.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><p>In relation to rate of growth - from a quick glance we can see that they must be doing something right. They are growing at orders of magnitude compared to their established competition. This is somewhat to be expected with growth companies compared to established competitors, but it is definitely something to look out for.</p><p>Lastly, a good sign of competitiveness within an industry is when rival CEO&#8217;s mention your company as a threat. For example, Palo Alto Network CEO mentioned Crowdstrike in a recent conference call - &#8220;Don't forget, in each of those areas, we are dealing with a extremely competitive situation. In the case of XDR, we deal with dedicated salespeople. And CrowdStrike, they outflank us 8:1 on the number of salespeople. So, we have to look hard at how much investment we want to make on the sales side. We do get leverage from the Palo Alto salespeople, eventually end up with hand to hand combat.&#8221;</p><h3>6.4. Crowdstrike vs SentinelOne</h3><p>As a relative beginner researching the space, it&#8217;s difficult to find many noteworthy differences between the two companies other than the obvious scale which likely means a higher quality of data and therefore a superior end-product for Crowdstrike.</p><p>Both operate within the same market with similar products, operating a similar cloud-based&nbsp; platform approach to security with similar architecture.

For example, FCF margin and operating margin are worrying signs for $S when you compare the two.</p><p>These initial numbers don&#8217;t look great for SentinelOne.</p><p>The thing is, in order to compete within this already crowded market, SentinelOne will need to invest heavily into growth activities which will further emphasise their margin issue. It will likely look (and currently does look) like the plan is to lower prices in order to attract more customers.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Quote from random reddit user -</strong> &#8220;<em>Both vendors were the top 2 that we POCed last summer. You really can't go wrong with either but CS right now has the most polish, and they are rocking the world. They have a new cloud security product just added, dark web monitoring, and a few more all in the same platform. You wont be disappointed how easy it is to use either. S1 might have a little more power if you are a scripter, but CS is just easier to use.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><p>Another quote (below) is from a question in the Crowdstrike earnings call asking about SentinelOne and market share.</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;There's a lot of noise, but I think you have to look at the numbers that we put up on the board. And, you know, one quarter of our net new ARR is probably 94% of their total ARR. So, you know, when we think about this, it's a big market.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><p>The problem is, burning cash as such a rapid rate is obviously not a good place to be for any company. I can easily see the next several years looking hard for the stock as they will need to continue to push prices lower, diminishing their pricing power and needing to be financed externally.</p><p>I personally don&#8217;t see another way SentinelOne can compete with other leading cybersecurity companies. The market is ridiculously competitive which basically means losses are a certainty over the next 2-3 years at least. </p><p>Probably a good company, but I am holding off investing for the time being until I see they are moving in the right direction.</p><h2>7.

Therefore, finding CEO&#8217;s with exemplary scores tends to be a good indication of competent management &amp; culture.</p><h3>7.1. Hiring mentality</h3><p>From my readings, George tries to foster a culture of strong work ethic in a fast-paced environment. This quote from a &#8216;foundation capital&#8217; interview highlights the mentality of hunger and grit that he likes to see in his employees.</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;When it comes to hiring a go-to-market team, George looks for someone with a <strong>combination of hunger, grit, and book smarts.</strong> His go-to question in an interview is <strong>&#8220;What drives you more, the will to win or the hatred to lose?&#8221;</strong> In his experience, it&#8217;s usually the people who hate to lose who are often the most driven. And while this drive is extremely important to success, it is equally as important that a hire is a team player and strong cultural fit. As George puts it, <strong>&#8220;you need to want to collectively win with the team.&#8221;</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>This obsession with hiring employees who are the &#8216;right fit&#8217; for the company is almost certainly a large contributing factor to Crowdstrike&#8217;s success so far.</p><p>He even compares hiring to be as important as financials, which is a refreshing take.</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;When it comes to hiring, a focus on finding the best is better than worrying about building fancy offices. I followed this formula when I founded CrowdStrike in 2011. This is why I've always focused on hiring individuals based on performance as opposed to location.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><h3>7.2. Building a mission</h3><p>George realizes the importance of everyone in the company being 100% focused on the mission. If there is no &#8216;north star&#8217; as a reference point, it&#8217;s easy to get lost in a sea of uncertainty.</p><p>He explains that for CrowdStrike, he didn&#8217;t want a static mission statement but rather a culture where employees could be passionate about the work of stopping &#8220;bad guys.&#8221;&nbsp; He writes&#8230; </p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;When you have passion, mission and purpose, you have limitless boundaries that unlock immense value to you, your shareholders and most importantly, your customers.</em></p><p><em>My journey into entrepreneurship wasn&#8217;t exactly planned and it hasn&#8217;t always been easy, but my advice is simple: Education and evolution are critical, always hire the best, and remain steadfast in believing in the change you and your team can deliver.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><p>In addition, the ability to focus on long-term goals rather than short-term targets is something investors love to see. The founding story is a testament to this. Back in 2011 when cloud-based cybersecurity wasn&#8217;t talked about by anyone, George Kurtz saw what it could be and didn&#8217;t stop until it became a reality.</p><p>Naturally, initial customers were skeptical. However, persistence and small steady strides towards a long-term goal saw customer&#8217;s opinions dramatically change over time. Now Crowdstrike operates the security for 63 of the fortune 100 companies, 234 of the fortune 500 companies, and 14 of the top 20 banks.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09a3aef9-d9c2-4bb0-a830-7f307508666f_1194x673.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09a3aef9-d9c2-4bb0-a830-7f307508666f_1194x673.png" width="1194" height="673" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/09a3aef9-d9c2-4bb0-a830-7f307508666f_1194x673.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:673,&quot;width&quot;:1194,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09a3aef9-d9c2-4bb0-a830-7f307508666f_1194x673.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09a3aef9-d9c2-4bb0-a830-7f307508666f_1194x673.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09a3aef9-d9c2-4bb0-a830-7f307508666f_1194x673.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09a3aef9-d9c2-4bb0-a830-7f307508666f_1194x673.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h3>7.3.

Fierce competitive nature</h3><p>Crowdstrike wouldn&#8217;t have gotten very far in this industry without keeping an eye closely on the competition. This attitude tends to manifest in the management team - comparing Crowdstrike to the competition in almost every earnings call.

I could easily see $S being a serious competitor to Crowdstike in the coming 5 years if they execute well.</p><h3>7.5. Personell</h3><p><strong>George Kurtz</strong> is the company's founder and CEO. He was CTO of McAfee before starting CrowdStrike. His history in the industry is rich, having published a well-renound book on Cybersecurity called &#8216;Hacking Exposed&#8217; and starting a company called Foundstone which was bought by McAfee in 2004.</p><p>In February 2020, Michael Sentonas was appointed CTO of Crowdstrike. He was formerly the company's Vice President of Technology Strategy. Prior to joining CrowdStrike, he served as McAfee's Chief Technology Officer &#8211; Security Connected and Chief Technology and Strategy Officer.</p><p>Lastly, <strong>Colin Black</strong> joined the business in 2015 and worked his way to become COO in 2017. Before joining CrowdStrike, he was CIO of Kratos Defense and Security Solutions, Inc. and Cymer &amp; Mindspeed Technologies, Inc.</p><h2>8. Bull</h2><p><strong>1. Sector tailwinds - </strong>Cloud as an industry is growing rapidly - with key drivers being secular tailwinds such as digital transformation and an increase in security breaches.</p><ul><li><p>This has led to two things happening - an increase in the number of cloud-native applications available due to better efficiency and scaleability, and the diminishing effectiveness of legacy antivirus companies compared to next gen companies like crowdstrike.</p></li></ul><p><strong>2. Durable economic moat - </strong>Manifesting in three main ways: a superior product with first-mover advantage and an overall sticky platform.</p><p><strong>- Superior product:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Efficiency </strong>- cloud-based, integrated platform meets enterprise demand for efficient consolidation of security solutions. Based on Gartner&#8217;s recent market report, most enterprises now own more than 75 security solutions, with almost half of them indicating a desire to consolidate security vendors in the next 2-3 years</p></li><li><p><strong>Strong endpoint performance</strong> - Falcon automatically organises data that is stored locally or streamed onto the Threat Graph, hence lessening the burden on client endpoints, compared to rivals whose on-premise approach means that clients can only manually clear data from endpoints through queries.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Diversification </strong>- modular-based architecture where additional solutions can be seamlessly added, enables greater personalisation to cater to diverse needs of enterprises. This makes it easy for CRWD to acquire customers of any size and expand across verticals, geographies and technical sophistication.</p></li></ul><p><strong>- First mover advantage:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Timining looks to be key in this market. Due to the relitively early start Crowdstrike had against many of their competitors, the company have been able to utilise the flywheel effect of having more data to feed into the AI system.</p></li><li><p>This means, because of the first mover advantage, crowdstrike are way ahead of the rest of the pack.</p></li></ul><p><strong>- Sticky platform:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Similar to above, as customers continue to grow the product only improves.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The modular nature of the platform allows easy onboarding and easy upselling. Over time this leads to increased switching costs for the end user.</p></li></ul><p><strong>3. Scalability</strong></p><p>It's a scalable solution that gains with the network effect and copying that network effect in an instant is very difficult.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4. Constant innovation</strong></p><p>I could talk about this point for days, but constant innovation is crucial if the aim is to remain a market leader.</p><p>This point especially applies to the cybersecurity industry where the core business model is keeping up with (or being one step ahead of) attackers. The attackers are constantly finding new innovative ways to get around Crowdstrike&#8217;s system.</p><p>Part of the strategy to be on top of the changes within the industry is to make strategic acquisitions.</p><p><strong>Peempt (Sept 2020)</strong> - Keeping up with the need for better protection against identity security threats.</p><p><strong>Humio (Mar 2021) - </strong>Enhancing the detection platform.</p><p><strong>5. High Margin model -</strong> The simple strategy of &#8216;land and expand&#8217;, I.e. to gain an initial subscription customer with the goal of upselling modules at a much higher margin in the future is likely to be effective. This will continue to drive the Average Revenue Per User (ARPU).</p><h2>9. Bear</h2><p><strong>1. Will the moat be there in 5 years time?</strong></p><p>One way to measure the likelihood of a durable moat in any particular industry is to look at the number of new entrants in the last decade. Industries consisting of companies with strong moats tend to only have several main players or have consolidated to several main players.</p><p>E.g. the CPU/GPU market consolidated to NVDIA, AMD and Intel with almost no new entrants over the past decade. This indicates a strong moat.</p><p>If we then look at the TV/Film industry which is rapidly changing and evolving, there have been lots of new entrants - showing that it&#8217;s not hard to knock the market leader off the top spot (i.e. weak moat).</p><p>Cybersecurity is more similar to the entertainment industry than the CPU/GPU industry in this regard. There were countless past leaders over the last decade - e.g. Symantec, Mcafee and Palo Alto Networks. None lasted. </p><p>Because of this, it&#8217;s looking likely that within the next 5-10 years we might see a new leader. Time will tell.</p><p><strong>2. Unprofitable on GAAP basis</strong></p><p>CrowdStrike's top-line growth is amazing, but the company is still unprofitable under GAAP. Its net loss increased in fiscal 2020, decreased in fiscal 2021, then almost tripled year over year to $142.4 million in the first half of 2022. This growing deficit may be ascribed to the firm's recent acquisition of Humio, a cloud-based data logging company, its high stock-based compensation expenditures (which devoured 20% of its sales in the first half of the year), and escalating R&amp;D and marketing expenses.</p><p><strong>3. Share dilution</strong></p><p>CrowdStrike's reliance on stock incentives has increased the number of outstanding shares since its IPO, and continuous dilution may keep its values from dropping. On the other hand, their non-GAAP earnings continue to improve. The company reached non-GAAP profitability in FY2021 and aims to raise non-GAAP net income by 64 percent to 86 percent this year.</p><p><strong>4. Stiff competition</strong></p><p>The cybersecurity industry is crowded in nature with a host of well established, well funded legacy companies which could limit the growth potential for a company like Crowdstrike, even with their strong value proposition.</p><p>To counter this point, beyond their main market in the US, CRWD has steadily expanded into differing industries and geographies, all of which increase the potential TAM. For example, in April&#8217;s FY21 analyst call, management estimated the Total Addressable Market (TAM) to be $43.6 B in FY23.</p><p><strong>5. If Falcon platform is breached, it could be catastrophic</strong></p><p>Crowdstrike take a lot of pride in their Falcon platform, having built up a level of trust and relationship with some of the worlds top companies. If they were to experience any sort of breach, this would put their whole system under question.</p><p><strong>6. Looked at in detail by many analysts</strong></p><p>Not necessarily a bad thing, but due to the company&#8217;s recent success they have caught the attention of most analysts. This leads to major sensitivity in share price if they don&#8217;t meet/exceed expectations almost every quarter.</p><h2>10. Financials</h2><p>Before we get into the meat of the financials, lets take a look at a few key metrics which give a good indication of performance. Bare in mind, most of these metrics are from the investor presentation and quarterly earnings call - so possibly cherry-picked by the company.</p><ol><li><p>Subscription growth has increased dramatically over the past year, with Q2 2022 seeing an 81% increase Y/Y. And between 2020 and 2021 subscribers grew 82% from 5,431 to 9,896. Crowdstrike is well and truly in hyper-growth mode, having added a record 1,660 new subscription customers in the last quarter.</p></li></ol><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbacd7796-c4bb-44e4-9bee-f78171d20a42_1194x673.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbacd7796-c4bb-44e4-9bee-f78171d20a42_1194x673.jpeg" width="532" height="299.86264656616413" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bacd7796-c4bb-44e4-9bee-f78171d20a42_1194x673.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:673,&quot;width&quot;:1194,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:532,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbacd7796-c4bb-44e4-9bee-f78171d20a42_1194x673.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbacd7796-c4bb-44e4-9bee-f78171d20a42_1194x673.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbacd7796-c4bb-44e4-9bee-f78171d20a42_1194x673.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbacd7796-c4bb-44e4-9bee-f78171d20a42_1194x673.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><ol start="2"><li><p>ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) is increasing rapidly.

The below graph implies Crowdstrike have been successful in this endeavour over the past 4 years, with gross margin rising from 36% in FY17 to 76% in FY21.</p></li></ol><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fe5e25d-01bf-47f4-9dc4-4ff1b9576147_1196x673.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fe5e25d-01bf-47f4-9dc4-4ff1b9576147_1196x673.png" width="540" height="303.8628762541806" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4fe5e25d-01bf-47f4-9dc4-4ff1b9576147_1196x673.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:673,&quot;width&quot;:1196,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:540,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fe5e25d-01bf-47f4-9dc4-4ff1b9576147_1196x673.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fe5e25d-01bf-47f4-9dc4-4ff1b9576147_1196x673.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fe5e25d-01bf-47f4-9dc4-4ff1b9576147_1196x673.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fe5e25d-01bf-47f4-9dc4-4ff1b9576147_1196x673.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Another statistic backing up the above graph as well as emphasizing the product&#8217;s stickiness, is the chart below.

Despite this, the balance sheet remains strong with a current ratio (current assets/current liabilities) of 1.98.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd50050e9-863d-4782-ad36-40e0b9bd1e7b_1113x279.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd50050e9-863d-4782-ad36-40e0b9bd1e7b_1113x279.png" width="1113" height="279" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d50050e9-863d-4782-ad36-40e0b9bd1e7b_1113x279.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:279,&quot;width&quot;:1113,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd50050e9-863d-4782-ad36-40e0b9bd1e7b_1113x279.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd50050e9-863d-4782-ad36-40e0b9bd1e7b_1113x279.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd50050e9-863d-4782-ad36-40e0b9bd1e7b_1113x279.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd50050e9-863d-4782-ad36-40e0b9bd1e7b_1113x279.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h3>10.4.

At first glance it&#8217;s clear to see an obvious gap in multiples, this is mainly due to the stage of growth these companies are currently in. CRWD is in their hypergrowth stage. I would class the others as mature-growth.</p><p>Basically CRWD will look expensive at these levels. However, the key difference is the stage of growth these companies are in. Crowdstrike is in hypergrowth mode. 50-60% rev growth compared to 15-20% rev growth for the industry standard companies.</p><h2>12. Final thoughts</h2><p>All things considering, I have come away form this deep-dive really liking Crowdstrike as a business. Their subscription business and overall strategy has the potential to be highly profitable over the coming years.</p><p>Taking into account the imminent and very real threat of the other strong players within the industry like Microsoft and SentinelOne, Crowdstrike have proven a durable moat which should see them cement their first-mover-advantage.</p><p>Strong management/culture, powerful industry tailwinds, an astute strategy for growth and consistent innovation all work in crowdstrike&#8217;s favor - offering significant potential for future success.</p><p>Valuation can&#8217;t be ignored in this situation - and as much as I think there is potential for real upside, the risk of significant downside is also there.</p><p>Therefore, my approach to investing into the Cybersecurity industry is to take a broad basket approach for the time being - either taking small stakes in the main players, or following an ETF such as $CIBR, $BUG, $IHAK or $HACK. </p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Innovestor</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[2 stocks on my Growth watchlist]]></title><description><![CDATA[... and why]]></description><link>https://innovestor.substack.com/p/2-stocks-on-my-growth-watchlist</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://innovestor.substack.com/p/2-stocks-on-my-growth-watchlist</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Innovestor]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 12:22:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46c3210b-63d3-4781-97df-c2e91528b61a_2844x1600.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this paid segment I aim to share with you some of the top stocks on my growth portfolio watch-list and the reasoning behind their appearance.

I graduated in Economics with a specialization in finance but my interest in investing did not come from my university degree, it came from my will to learn more during my spare time. Although very lightly, I did touch on some investment related topics in some of my lectures which made me want to dig deeper into the world of investing&#8230;</p><p>I started reading the typical books and articles written by investors such as Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch that every rookie investor reads. I would like to make clear that I still consider myself a rookie. This is basically my background before I started investing.</p><p>I actually spent two years or three years reading about investing before investing one single dollar. Perhaps this was motivated by the fact that I did not have much money back then as a student. This, however, was a stupid decision in hindsight because we all know the power of recurrent small amounts (such as 50&#8364;/monthly) compounded during long periods. </p><p>Another reason why I didn&#8217;t start investing immediately was because I thought that I needed to learn all the theory before turning into the practice. This, of course, was another stupid decision because I could&#8217;ve learned much faster by putting some money on the line, even if this was a small amount.</p><p>My <strong>earliest investing memory</strong> was talking to a friend to open an account and start dollar cost averaging several index funds. It was obvious that we were not reinventing the wheel but it worked out pretty well if I might say. All of the books I had read about investing pushed me to keep it simple which is why I decided to start passive. I have now changed my strategy towards a more &#8220;active&#8221; one but I never stopped DCAing index funds.</p><p>The thing I like the most about investing is that it requires you to improve daily.</p><p>As much as this might seem something vague to say, investing has also helped me improve other areas of my life by drastically improving my organizational skills for example. </p><p>I also love the fact that, regardless if you make money or not, you are always learning about new business models and ways of doing business, knowledge which I consider very valuable as I can apply it to my 9-5 for example.</p><blockquote><p>Innovestor</p></blockquote><p>Thanks IQ - I think we both have quite a lot in common here. I especially like your point about always learning when investing. I can&#8217;t think of many other activities offering the potential to constantly expand ones knowledge in a wide a variety of industries and professions as investing.</p><p><strong>Moving on to the second question</strong> - we both started growing on twitter at similar times, so it has been great to watch your success in gaining so many followers, producing such high-quality content on the Global Investor Newsletter and becoming a key contributing writer on the Potential Multibaggers service. </p><p>What was the motivation behind pursuing these avenues, and do you have a plan on where you want to be in several years time?</p><blockquote><p>Invesquotes</p></blockquote><p>I honestly just started my twitter account because I enjoyed reading about investing and wanted to share some of the quotes I found interesting. It&#8217;s actually kind of crazy how much you can learn about investing just reading famous quotes. </p><p>After this first period where I basically just used the account to follow much more intelligent people than me and share some quotes, I decided to start sharing my thoughts as this would help me learn faster and&#8230;it worked! As soon as I started engaging with other accounts my learning curve became much steeper.</p><p>I then started doing some threads which I called &#8220;At a glance&#8221; so people could get a quick grasp of what a company did and the main financials and then, motivated by Route2FI, I decided to write longer articles and I published a deep dive on Pinterest.</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/Invesquotes/status/1371798496395792384?s=20&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;&#128064; $TDOC (Teladoc) at a glance!\n\nIf you want to take a quick glance at the global leader in the telehealth industry then this thread is for you!\n\nLets go! &#11015;&#65039; &quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;Invesquotes&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;IQ&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Tue Mar 16 12:20:22 +0000 2021&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[{&quot;img_url&quot;:&quot;https://pbs.substack.com/media/EwmbdYmWEAAKNJn.jpg&quot;,&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;https://t.co/uP7M3BfqM2&quot;,&quot;alt_text&quot;:null}],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:137,&quot;like_count&quot;:638,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null}"><a href="https://twitter.com/Invesquotes/status/1371798496395792384?s=20" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-user-avatar" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/twitter_name/w_36/Invesquotes.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @Invesquotes"><span class="tweet-author-name">IQ </span><span class="tweet-author">@Invesquotes</span></div>&#128064; $TDOC (Teladoc) at a glance!

I had already been in contact with Kris very early since opening the twitter account and I admired what he had built with Potential Multibaggers. I was a subscriber so ending up being a contributor was out of this world!</p><p>I have no specific plan of where I want to be in several years but I do know that I will keep investing and sharing my research regardless of market conditions.</p><p>Where will I end up? Only time will tell!</p><blockquote><p>Innovestor</p></blockquote><p>Thanks - so a quick follow-up - Seeing as your twitter account was originally focused on investing quotes, I&#8217;m hoping you might have some insight into this&#8230;</p><p>What is your favourite investing quote, and why?</p><blockquote><p>Invesquotes</p></blockquote><p>Great question.</p><p><em>&#8220;In the business world, the rearview mirror is always clearer than the windshield&#8221;<strong> - Warren Buffett</strong></em></p><p>I like the way it illustrates hindsight bias, as I see that hindsight bias is one of the worst poisons for new investors.</p><p>And to newer investors it occurs constantly - &#8220;Why did I sell this? Look how it has run up.&#8221; - It hurts, but when you made the decision you acted on the info available to you.</p><blockquote><p>Innovestor</p></blockquote><p>Agreed. Even outside of investing, hindsight bias is something we come across all the time. Really useful to check yourself every now and then.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Investing Style</h2><blockquote><p>Innovestor</p></blockquote><p><strong>Moving onto question 3</strong>, lets get into your investing style.</p><p>Like me, you seem to have a focus on higher growth companies - is there any rationale behind this? </p><p>Then, regarding your portfolio in general, do you have a process for generating new ideas along with a strategy for position sizing and things like &#8216;timing the market&#8217;?</p><blockquote><p>Invesquotes</p></blockquote><p>Well, I look for high growth because I think that investing is all about the future and looking for these types of companies will increase my chances of obtaining higher returns. </p><p>Another very different thing is what everyone considers as high growth. I always take into account &#8220;growth compounding&#8221; because lower growth rates compounded over longer periods are much better than higher unsustainable growth rates. This is exactly why investors look for moats.</p><p>To generate new ideas I tend to listen to people that are much more knowledgeable than me and from there I try to research these suggestions in depth because I can&#8217;t borrow their conviction. </p><p>I think that I have quite a different approach when it comes to position sizing because I monitor my portfolio on a cost basis rather than on a &#8220;current value&#8221; basis. My rationale is that I can control how much initial capital I pour into each position but I can&#8217;t control how much these positions run up or down over the short term. </p><p>About timing the market, I think it can&#8217;t be done with enough accuracy to be worthwhile and I suck at it so I just DCA without taking macro much into account. </p><p>Macro is a highly complex endeavor.</p><blockquote><p>Innovestor</p></blockquote><p>Digging slightly deeper - when analysing the fundamentals of growth companies, are you looking for anything in particular over-and-above promising financials and strong key metrics? </p><p>For example, do you rate management and culture as important factors to consider?</p><blockquote><p>Invesquotes</p></blockquote><p>Actually, it&#8217;s funny that you touched on this topic in particular because management quality and culture is what I think is most important when analyzing growth companies. </p><p>During their early stages, companies rely strongly on decisions made by management so great management can make a company thrive by making the right calls and bad management can ruin great companies. The clear example is Cloudflare vs Fastly. </p><p>As companies grow, management is still important but less crucial because it takes more bad decisions to screw things up.</p><p>Funnily enough, I weigh management so much that when doing the Farfetch deep dive that we released recently I just wanted to invest because I thought that management was exceptional. At the end I did not start a position and I hope that I don&#8217;t regret not investing in such great management.</p><blockquote><p>Innovestor</p></blockquote><p>As a follow-up, you mention the importance of management and culture when looking into companies. Do you have any common indicators of good management/culture (e.g. glassdoor scores etc.)? </p><p>In other words how do we, as investors, distinguish between good and bad management/culture without the luxury of being a 'fly on the wall'?</p><blockquote><p>Invesquotes</p></blockquote><p>That&#8217;s a great question and I think that many investors have different ways of assessing management because no two humans are alike. What I might like to see on a CEO might differ greatly from what another investor is looking for. This is something natural. </p><p><strong>I try to look mainly for trust and vision.</strong> Without the former I know that the latter is of little use. </p><p>To assess trust I go to earnings calls that go a couple of quarters back and see what management was promising. Once I know what they had promised I turn to recent earnings to see if they were able to deliver. Great management will promise x and deliver x+y, I always look for this. </p><p>Another important thing I like to look out for is how the vision has evolved from start to finish. If the founders are still executing on a vision they had 10 years ago and it&#8217;s working, that&#8217;s a great sign of visionary management. </p><p>It&#8217;s also important to see if management is coherent. Is management&#8217;s compensation aligned with long term objectives? If the answer is no, you better run. I don&#8217;t care if insiders sell stock, I care if they reduce their stake significantly. </p><p>Last but not least, I try to watch as many interviews as I can. It&#8217;s crucial (and I know it&#8217;s going to sound dumb) to watch these interviews to get a grasp of how confident management are on what they are executing on, as well as to analyse how much they trust themselves. Some managers have given me great first impressions participating in interviews, and for me this is a great sign. </p><p>Assessing culture is a bit more complicated, especially for younger companies. I use glassdoor reviews as preliminary indicator and then I try to dig deeper into the issues I find. For example, when doing Farfetch, I could clearly see in the reviews that culture and work environment were great but salaries were not that great so I looked more into it using additional sources. </p><p>What I want to make clear is that trust is something personal and no two investors will end up trusting the same people. Give your money to people who you trust and you&#8217;ll do fine!</p><blockquote><p>Innovestor</p></blockquote><p>Cheers for the detailed answer.</p><p>Moving on, one commonly held opinion here on twitter is the idea that we buy a stock with the intention to 'never sell'. Does this hold true for you? What is your general philosophy on this?</p><blockquote><p>Invesquotes</p></blockquote><p>I would agree with that if I could add &#8220;<strong>as long as the thesis remains intact</strong>&#8221; to it. </p><p>I consider myself a buy and hold investor but I don&#8217;t fall in love with the companies I own. If the thesis remains intact then I don&#8217;t care what the stock does, I will not sell. If, on the other hand, the thesis changes, I won't hesitate to sell, regardless of the stock price.</p><blockquote><p>Innovestor</p></blockquote><p>Next, what is your opinion on valuation when looking at companies? As a growth investor myself, many of the companies we follow tend to have 'historically' expensive valuations. </p><p>What factors do you look for in these 'expensive' stocks?</p><blockquote><p>Invesquotes</p></blockquote><p>I do take into account valuation but I don&#8217;t get overly concerned with it. </p><p>When I think about valuation I automatically think more about the downside rather than the upside. If you are on to the next big company, a high multiple should not scare you because winners tend to grow quickly into their valuations and continue growing after that. However, if you pick an expensive stock and it doesn&#8217;t play out, your downside is much higher because expensive stocks are priced to &#8220;perfection&#8221; as some might say.</p><p>I would never look at valuation in isolation, there are many more important things to look at before looking at valuation, mainly because without context, valuation makes absolutely no sense, it&#8217;s just a number.</p><blockquote><p>Innovestor</p></blockquote><p>Agreed.</p><p>Last question on the topic of growth investing - will you always be primarily a growth investor? Or do you think this will change to more passive methods as you age/evolve?</p><blockquote><p>Invesquotes</p></blockquote><p>This is a great question! I think my strategy will not change because, besides having alpha as an objective, I enjoy researching companies so I don&#8217;t see why I would change to a strategy that I don&#8217;t enjoy as much. </p><p>Having said this, only time will tell!</p><div><hr></div><h2>Opinions on various topics</h2><blockquote><p>Innovestor</p></blockquote><p>For the last section, lets focus on other areas.</p><p>Looking at how technology has changed over the past several years, what (if any), emerging trends or technology developments do you think investors should be looking out for? </p><p>An example for me is immersive technology (heavily biased) along with the shift to remote work/freelance. Both, in my opinion, are huge opportunities for growth in the future.</p><blockquote><p>Invesquotes</p></blockquote><p>I completely agree with your choices and I would like to add data. </p><p>I think that tech and digital connections inevitably bring increased amounts of data and many companies don&#8217;t have the infrastructure to make sense of this data, especially legacy companies. This is why I like Palantir, it&#8217;s really sticky and has a head start with Foundry.</p><p>I also think that adtech will continue to thrive, especially those companies that are able to deliver richer quality ads in the most demanded formats. Right now, video is driving engagement but maybe in the future these companies will need to adapt their ad formats to something immersive such as AR/VR and that might be a huge opportunity for those companies that manage to do the transition.</p><blockquote><p>Innovestor</p></blockquote><p>Great choices.</p><p>A topic which tends to split old-school and new-school investors is Crypto &amp; Blockchain. </p><p>For me, as someone who considers themselves to be somewhere between the two, I'm curious to learn more about crypto and Blockchain along with the technologies it could enable - such as the metaverse. </p><p>Do you have an opinion on the topic? And do you think it's an area/opportunity growth investors should at least consider?</p><blockquote><p>Invesquotes</p></blockquote><p>I actually don&#8217;t know enough about crypto to have a well informed opinion. </p><p>This said, I think that in the future crypto tech will be really important but maybe the only currencies that will thrive will be those backed by the government. Who knows.</p><blockquote><p>Innovestor</p></blockquote><p>Makes sense.</p><p>Are there any investors you look up to? If so, why?</p><blockquote><p>Invesquotes</p></blockquote><p>On the &#8220;goat side&#8221; I would say that I enjoy reading things written by Peter Lynch, Warren Buffett and Phil Fisher. I also enjoy Stanley Druckenmiller and have been reading pieces written by him lately.

Introduction</h2><p>In this new segment, my aim is to work through various industries where I see potential investment trends - outlining the main players, the market dynamics and main points you need to know in order to make informed investment decisions.</p><p>One of the many important aspects of long-term investing involves identifying and acting on industry trends. As with many things, this is easier said than done. Not everything which seems a &#8216;sure bet&#8217; at this moment will become the next big industry.</p><p>Part of investing in emerging industries is down to timing, part is down to technological change, part luck.</p><p>Over the time-frame of the Covid-19 pandemic, Immersive technology has experienced a multitude of favourable tailwinds - propelling the industry forwards exponentially. These <strong>tailwinds include hardware developments, commercial appeal, industry backing, metaverse talk, the shift towards remote working and the fact people want to connect in more authentic ways online.</strong></p><p>In this Industry Spotlight I will aim to outline what this trend means for us, as investors, and how we can position our portfolio in order to benefit from this potential opportunity.</p><p>To start, let's take a broad look at the industry. Who are the main players? What is the technology involved? And how has the industry grown?</p><div><hr></div><h2>2. The hardware</h2><p>To fully understand the industry, let's first take a look at the core hardware. This won&#8217;t be an extensive look, but more of an overview.</p><h3>2.1.Virtual Reality</h3><p><em><strong>&#8220;Virtual reality is a complete immersion of experiences that completely shuts off the physical world.&#8221;</strong></em></p><p>The idea of virtual reality has been around for a long, long time. With the first attempt at a headset coming roughly 70 years ago&#8230;</p><blockquote><p><em>Invented in the 1950s, VR&#8217;s development has experienced peaks and troughs. The first VR head-mounted display (HMD) system, The Sword of Damocles, was invented in 1968 by computer scientist Ivan Sutherland and his student Bob Sproull. Meanwhile, the term &#8220;virtual reality&#8221; was popularised by Jaron Lanier in the 1980s. Ten years later, VR was used for training and simulation in the US military and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Mass production of VR systems began in the early 1990s, led by Virtuality, which opened dedicated VR arcades.</em></p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3869a987-b8ff-4dd3-8959-939e2422d443_528x282.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3869a987-b8ff-4dd3-8959-939e2422d443_528x282.png" width="528" height="282" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3869a987-b8ff-4dd3-8959-939e2422d443_528x282.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:282,&quot;width&quot;:528,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3869a987-b8ff-4dd3-8959-939e2422d443_528x282.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3869a987-b8ff-4dd3-8959-939e2422d443_528x282.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3869a987-b8ff-4dd3-8959-939e2422d443_528x282.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3869a987-b8ff-4dd3-8959-939e2422d443_528x282.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">The Sword of Damocles</figcaption></figure></div><p>Since the 50&#8217;s, VR technology development has been moving at a snails-pace up until about the last 5 years where the technology used in VR headsets has become powerful enough to produce consumer-ready &#8216;tetherless&#8217; (without the need for wires) headsets.</p><p>The first, and by far the most popular tetherless device was the Oculus Quest (owned by Facebook).

This could make high-end VR far more accessible to the average consumer - acting as a &#8216;bolt-on&#8217; to the PS5 software/hardware stack.</p><p>Currently, in order to have a good tethered experience, you would need to own a powerful gaming PC - which most do not have/cannot afford.</p><h3>2.2. Augmented Reality</h3><p>Whereas virtual reality replaces your vision, augmented reality adds to it. AR devices, such as the Microsoft HoloLens and various enterprise-level "smart glasses," are transparent, letting you see everything in front of you.</p><p>These AR devices are designed to act as a bridge between the physical and digital worlds and allows for freedom of movement whilst projecting images over your physical environment.</p><p>The concept of AR extends to smart devices which includes AR apps and games, such as Pokemon Go which uses your phone&#8217;s camera to track your surroundings and overlay additional information onto the screen.</p><p>The information displayed can be as simple as a data overlay showing weather, time or speed. Conversely, the projections can be as complex as 3D holograms which the user can interact with. Below is a video from 2019 which is a useful demonstration on the current &#8216;vision&#8217; for enterprise AR.</p><div id="youtube2-8wHC2Rb46H4" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;8wHC2Rb46H4&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8wHC2Rb46H4?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>Some might perceive the lesser levels of immersion as a disadvantage compared to Virtual Reality, which is fair. For example, While VR completely covers and replaces your field of vision (FOV), AR apps only show up on your smartphone/tablet screen. Additionally, the HoloLens can only project images in a limited area in front of your eyes (small FOV). It isn't very immersive when a hologram disappears once it moves out of a rectangle in the middle of your vision, or when you must stare at a small screen while pretending that the object on that screen is in front of you.</p><h4>2.2.1.Competitive landscape</h4><p>The Augmented reality landscape is, just like Virtual Reality, very much in the emergent phase. We could argue some companies are ahead of others in terms of product development or market share, however these dynamics could easily change in the near future.</p><p>More than likely we will see the big players like Facebook, Microsoft, Samsung, Apple and Snapchat hoover up smaller companies in order to add to their product offering.</p><p>There are two broad classes of AR apps: <strong>marker-based apps</strong> and <strong>location-based apps</strong>. Marker-based apps use predefined markers to trigger the display of AR overlays on top of the image. Location-based apps use the GPS, accelerometer, or compass information to display AR objects on top of physical ones.</p><p>Splitting Augmented reality into distinct sectors, we can see various leaders:</p><h5><strong>Enterprise (professional use):</strong></h5><p>Microsoft has established their intent to lead the way in terms of Augmented Reality hardware and software within the enterprise market. Their Hololens glasses, along with the Microsoft Mesh software gives them a big advantage moving forwards.</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/MicrosoftDesign/status/1392855087031017472?&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Touch it&#8212;you know you want to.

Software</h3><h4><strong>2.3.1. VR</strong></h4><p>The main software being used within VR development falls into two main buckets - <strong>Unity</strong> or <strong>Unreal Engine</strong>. You can use both for VR development, and it&#8217;s mainly a matter of personal preference as to which engine you go with.</p><h4><strong>2.3.2. AR</strong></h4><p>AR is a bit more complex at this stage. Mostly you can still use the core game engines to do most of the grunt-work, however specific bolt-ons will be needed. Simplifying this massively, these bolt-ons are called SDK&#8217;s (Software Development Kits). Examples include:</p><ul><li><p>Vuforia</p></li><li><p>Apple AR kit</p></li><li><p>AR Core</p></li><li><p>Spark AR Studio</p></li><li><p>AR Toolkit</p></li><li><p>Google AR Core</p></li><li><p>Maxst</p></li><li><p>Wikitude</p></li></ul><p>In addition to this, Snapchat are making real strides at enabling simple AR development in order to create a user-generated library of AR content. <a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/">This is called Lens Studio</a>.</p><div><hr></div><h2>3. Use cases</h2><h3>3.1. Training</h3><p>Virtual reality enables training for situations never before possible. The addition of full &#8216;immersion&#8217; helps improve concentration and therefore retention.</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/intelligent-digital/virtual-reality-vr-augmented-reality-ar/study-into-vr-training-effectiveness.html">A PWC study shows</a> 40% of VR-learners saw improved confidence compared to classroom learners and 35% improvement over e-learners to act on what they learned after training in VR.</p></blockquote><p>An example of a UK-based company specialising in VR training for hazardous situations is a company called <a href="https://www.digitalnauts.co.uk/">Digitalnauts.</a> They help to create realistic environments which would be hard to replicate without danger in real life.</p><div id="youtube2-V-CBLqAHJkI" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;V-CBLqAHJkI&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V-CBLqAHJkI?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><h3>3.2. Remote work</h3><p>As we have discovered over the past year, remote working is becoming more common and yet still remains a struggle for the vast majority of people. Without the element of human connection and collaboration, many jobs have suffered.</p><ul><li><p>VR and AR devices aims to enable collaboration between colleagues in disparate locations.</p></li><li><p>Microsoft are targeting this market with their Hololens 2 technology and Microsoft Mesh software stack.</p></li></ul><div id="youtube2-Jd2GK0qDtRg" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;Jd2GK0qDtRg&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Jd2GK0qDtRg?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>Another interesting product is <a href="https://www.vuzix.com/products">VuziX&#8217;s AR glasses</a> - allowing users to benefit from experts watching and instructing from around the world.</p><h3>3.3. Marketing</h3><p>At its core, immersion sells. Due to this fact, we are beginning to see more and more examples of immersive experiences within advertising.</p><ul><li><p>"67% of media planners and buyers want AR/VR ads in digital marketing campaigns"</p></li><li><p>Greater levels of immersion result in warmer leads.</p></li><li><p>An immersive experience results in a better connection to the product/brand.</p></li></ul><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/StreetFashion01/status/1432655695401336832?s=20&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Augmented Reality experiment on Louis Vuitton&#8217;s New York Store by Reference!

Education</h3><p>Similar to the training use-case, VR and AR prompt emotional responses due to the feeling of &#8216;presence&#8217;.&nbsp; Studies have found we are more likely to retain information when emotion is triggered.</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Retention levels from VR learning are up to 75%, compared to 5-10% for other learning methods. Hands-on experience stimulates an <a href="https://jime.open.ac.uk/articles/10.5334/jime.472/">emotional response from a learner</a> and makes <a href="https://virtualspeech.com/blog/experiential-learning-vr">training more memorable</a>.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><p>Innovation is still young in this field, but it&#8217;s looking promising that immersive technology will be used to optimize learning and retention?</p><h3>3.5. Fashion</h3><p>Another unintended impact of the pandemic (although a trend that was well underway beforehand) is the normalisation of shopping from home. I can safely say I shop from my phone or PC far more often than I will go into any shop nowadays. </p><ul><li><p>Being able to try on outfits using AR filters will be a game-changer.</p></li><li><p>You might even have an avatar with your exact sizing - allowing you to visualize the outfit.

Trends for the future</h2><p><strong>*Note - these are just MY predictions*</strong></p><ol><li><p>Within the next decade, augmented reality will become a core tool for almost every industry (as outlined in the Use Cases section).</p></li><li><p>5G/6G will accelerate the adoption and development of Immersive Technologies.</p></li><li><p>VR/AR technology will be a direct window into the first instances of the &#8216;Metaverse&#8217;.</p></li><li><p>Remote work/collaboration will become commonplace, making these technologies the norm.</p></li><li><p>VR will lag behind AR due to fewer short-term use-cases, but will ultimately be capable of &#8216;full immersion&#8217; within the next 10-20 years.

Stocks I think will benefit</h2><p>Because of the relatively emergent nature of the immersive technology sector, it&#8217;s very difficult to be wholly confident in these investments playing out as I envisage. Below, I have outlined several companies I believe will benefit from the trend towards AR/VR.</p><h5>Obvious picks</h5><p>These are current leaders in the immersive sector in one way or another, which I predict will remain dominant in the sector:</p><ul><li><p>Facebook (VR/AR)</p></li><li><p>Snapchat (AR)</p></li><li><p>Apple (AR)</p></li><li><p>Microsoft (AR)</p></li><li><p>Samsung (VR/AR)</p></li><li><p>HTC (VR)</p></li><li><p>Sony (VR)</p></li><li><p>Google (AR/VR)</p></li></ul><h5>Picks and Shovel</h5><p>Then we have the picks and shovel plays. You can think of these as the building blocks by which the AR and VR industry will be built upon. Only thing to note here is the fact that the AR/VR industry is a small subsection in relation to the scope of some of these businesses.</p><p>You could even go slightly higher-level picks and shovel by looking at manufacturers of AR projecting technology or screen technology, but I think this area has a tonne of development ahead.</p><ul><li><p>Nvidia</p></li><li><p>Qualcomm</p></li><li><p>Unity</p></li><li><p>Epic Games (not public, but could expose via Tencent, which owns 40%)</p></li></ul><h5>Lesser known</h5><p>Then we have some slightly lesser-known AR/VR picks. These are companies who may be focusing of specific technologies within the immersive ecosystem such as haptics or AR screen displays:</p><ul><li><p>Lementum (AR screen hardware)</p></li><li><p>Immersion Corporation (haptics)</p></li><li><p>Vuzix (AR for business)</p></li><li><p>Microvision (projecting images onto glass)</p></li><li><p>Autodesk (AutoCad will directly benefit from AR adoption)</p></li><li><p>ETSY (introducing AR within retail)</p></li><li><p>HiMax (integrated circuits for digital displays, chips)</p></li><li><p>Tobii (eye tracking)</p></li><li><p>WiMi Hologram (AR advertising)</p></li><li><p>Miriad (AR advertising)&nbsp;</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2>7. Risks to consider</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Global chip shortage</strong> - a global shortage in the availability of hardware needed to produce AR/VR devices will lead to higher development costs and therefore higher prices pushed to consumers - therefore leading to slower adoption rates.</p></li><li><p><strong>Early days within the industr</strong>y - It&#8217;s still too early to know whether this technology will take off in the future as I predict. Also, the companies leading the space at the moment aren&#8217;t necessarily going to be the leaders in 10-15 years time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Technology usability is a long way off</strong> - take Augmented Reality for example, if you have used an AR headset you will know that the &#8216;vision&#8217; of AR (as portrayed in film and TV) is far away from the &#8216;reality&#8217;. Here&#8217;s a video to show what I mean. And this isn&#8217;t to say it&#8217;s not good&#8230; The current &#8216;state of the art&#8217; in terms of AR technology is mind-blowing, however it&#8217;s still a way off being fully commercially ready.</p></li></ol><div id="youtube2-t0q8vWLjkyo" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;t0q8vWLjkyo&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:&quot;300&quot;,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/t0q8vWLjkyo?start=300&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://innovestor.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://innovestor.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h2>8. Conclusion</h2><p>In summary, the line between digital and physical is becoming more and more blurry as this industry continues to develop alongside other key technologies.</p><p>The lofty predictions for high growth within the Immersive Technology sector are not unwarranted. The pandemic has been a real boost to consumer experimentation and has opened many peoples eyes regarding what is possible - accelerating the development of the industry.</p><p>The next decade will see these technologies become integral within many different industries. The potential is huge, so it's worth keeping an eye on how this industry develops.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Innovestor </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Next Deep-Dive Poll]]></title><link>https://innovestor.substack.com/p/next-deep-dive-poll</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://innovestor.substack.com/p/next-deep-dive-poll</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Innovestor]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2021 10:16:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_256,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F925b6969-f07d-42e0-830e-2c9c543b05bd_265x265.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Intro</h2><p>Tencent are one of the worlds most recognisable brands, yet most of the world have no idea what Tencent even is - such is the insularity of the Chinese market.</p><p>China (along with Tencent) are at the center of the news at the moment - and not in a good way. We&#8217;re seeing more and more frequently how decisions made at the very peak of the Chinese government are impacting the share-price of these tech-focused conglomerates. </p><p>In this lengthly deep-dive, I aim to answer the question of whether Tencent makes a good investment over the next 5-10 years. I touch on the various and interwoven business models at play and try to understand the context within the current market.</p><p>In addition, I will attempt to walk you through a simple valuation model to try to value the company over the next 5 years.</p><div><hr></div><h2>2.

However two aspects of the company&#8217;s early business model distinguished them from the pack.</p><h4>3.1 The initial success of QQ</h4><p>Firstly, rather than relying on advertising for the majority of the revenue, QQ helped to pioneer &#8220;<strong>Value added services&#8221;</strong>. </p><p>Users could purchase virtual goods like customisable avatars and gifts as status symbols. The success of this model was thought to be directly related to the fact that under communism, Chinese people had been &#8216;dull and collective&#8217; in their personal representation. QQ therefore enabled a representation of one&#8217;s self in a way that was never before possible.</p><p>Secondly, with the addition of each new product, Tencent have never truly been starting from scratch - the company would carry its enormous and growing user-base from one venture to the next until it had near monopoly-level control over the world&#8217;s largest market.</p><p>Then in <strong>2011 </strong>the company launched what would be their most successful ever product - an application known in English as<strong> WeChat</strong> (Weixin in China), which integrated with QQ. </p><p>WeChat continued to grow dramatically with the, now commonplace, WeChat Pay and Mini programs - which allows users to install other apps within the app.</p><p>In <strong>2021</strong>, you can think of WeChat to be about as close to a &#8216;super-app&#8217; as it gets. This is down to the fact that Chinese life is essentially entirely operated from inside the app. You have the ability to shop, pay, rent, run a business, game, consume media, make doctors appointments and much, much more.</p><p>This useful info-graphic from Vinyard Holding&#8217;s article on Tencent, nicely outlines just how all-encompassing the app actually is.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1f52cd4-10ee-4dfb-82e4-5dca647a1d17_1301x728.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1f52cd4-10ee-4dfb-82e4-5dca647a1d17_1301x728.png" width="1301" height="728" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e1f52cd4-10ee-4dfb-82e4-5dca647a1d17_1301x728.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:728,&quot;width&quot;:1301,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1f52cd4-10ee-4dfb-82e4-5dca647a1d17_1301x728.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1f52cd4-10ee-4dfb-82e4-5dca647a1d17_1301x728.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1f52cd4-10ee-4dfb-82e4-5dca647a1d17_1301x728.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1f52cd4-10ee-4dfb-82e4-5dca647a1d17_1301x728.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Texting has always been quite pricey in China, so unlike in the US &#8211; where large telecoms bundled texting with other phone services &#8211; WeChat was able to quickly fill the instant messaging gap and hit critical mass.

For example, if we look at the US, the technology ecosystem is filled with competition - we have multiple leading companies for almost every industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Whereas in China, it seems to be the case that Tencent are one of only several dominant companies, with competition being more concentrated to less than a handful across all industries.</p><p>This goes against our intuition due to the fact that China have a much larger population with a far greater diversification of languages, cultures, regions and not to forget the sheer size. You would therefore think these differences would result in a far greater diversity of options for consumers.</p><p>The distinction lies in the fact that the Chinese government is willing to give Chinese companies the freedom to operate as they see fit as long as the result is beneficial for the Chinese government. This has led to the existence of near-monopolies/duopolies with the clear examples being Tencent, Bidu, and Alibaba.</p><p>The elevation by the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) of these domestic Chinese companies serves 3 main purposes for the state&#8230;</p><ol><li><p><strong>Brand</strong> - Putting these companies on a pedestal serves to elevate the image of Chinese entrepreneurship, and therefore the Chinese &#8216;brand&#8217; as a whole. This is thought to make China look like a more prosperous society from the outside.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ensuring domestic success</strong> - the success of domestic companies comes at the expense of foreign ones. To the very limited extent that Western companies succeed in China, they do so with the express approval and financial benefit of a Chinese counterpart. It is even a legal requirement that foreign firms must parter with a local one.</p></li><li><p><strong>Territorial Power</strong> - The fact that these Chinese companies have become so overbearingly large with stakes in multiple global companies serves a slightly more malicious purpose - global dominance. With some level of power outside of mainland China, these Chinese companies will have the ability to impose their rules and regulations. One possible example of this would be the ability to collect data from EU/US citizens in companies Tencent has minority/majority stakes in - i.e. Snapchat, Riot, Reddit, Epic Games etc.</p></li></ol><p>In the following sub-sections I will try to give my insight into each of the core divisions Tencent operates within.

It&#8217;s genuinely hard to operate in modern China without using the WeChat platform. This is the real kicker in my opinion. It is what will enable Tencent to weather almost any storm.&nbsp;</p><p>As a gatekeeper to the market, WeChat is able to set prices, copy &amp; kill competitors, and be selective in what they show. An example of this is the fact that when companies outside of China attempt to enter the Chinese market, they end up either partnering with Tencent or dying a death.</p><p>Outside of the main functionality of the app, WeChat acts as sort of an enabler for Tencent to enter into each of their other industry segments - for example, payments and gaming. This type of thing has been mentioned many times before, but the flywheel effect here is significant. I.e. when merchants join the platform to access the customer base, it adds more reasons for new users to join - all while WeChat/Tencent take a small slice of the transaction value. Once the flywheel momentum starts, it&#8217;s hard to stop.</p><p>And yet, this app is only a relatively small aspect of the wider business model.</p><h4>4.2.1.

Gaming Strategy</h4><p>In the push for global gaming dominance, Tencent&#8217;s approach seems to be multi-pronged:</p><ol><li><p>Increase mergers &amp; acquisitions in overseas developers, like Riot Games and SuperCell.</p></li><li><p>Develop games internally (like Honour of Kings) to be published overseas. And also licence these games to key distribution partners (such as SEA Ltd).</p></li><li><p>License other IP assets at their disposal to develop new games for global mobile market (Call of Duty Mobile, PUBG Mobile)</p></li></ol><p>Gaming has always been a big deal in China with, one could argue, more brand loyalty attached than in the west. Gaming is also far more embedded in the culture, partially due to the type of games played. </p><p>In the west, early gaming was more along the lines of plug and play shoot-em-ups etc, whereas the far east were playing more Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs) - the most popular of which probably being World of Warcraft. These types of games lent themselves to Chinese culture as it enabled a sense of individuality via customization. These games tended not to have an end, therefore building up very sticky customers over a long period of time.</p><p>In addition to gaming being an integral part of the Chinese culture, the gaming business is great for flywheel effects. As shown by the image below, the on-ramp of gaming leads to many other avenues where monetisation is possible. </p><p>Therefore, owning the games is key to owning the flywheel.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3533754c-294e-42cd-acf3-5abb87660f20_2048x1875.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3533754c-294e-42cd-acf3-5abb87660f20_2048x1875.jpeg" width="1456" height="1333" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3533754c-294e-42cd-acf3-5abb87660f20_2048x1875.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1333,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3533754c-294e-42cd-acf3-5abb87660f20_2048x1875.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3533754c-294e-42cd-acf3-5abb87660f20_2048x1875.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3533754c-294e-42cd-acf3-5abb87660f20_2048x1875.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3533754c-294e-42cd-acf3-5abb87660f20_2048x1875.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>All that being said, gaming is a hard business. On the positive side of the spectrum - franchise games have brilliant unit economics, loyal customers, low capital expenditure requirements, regular streams of income, and strong pricing power. However, the downside is that successful games are almost impossible to produce on a reliable basis. This makes it hard to re-invest capital. It is also why gaming Intellectual Property is becoming so valuable.</p><p>In the context of Tencent&#8217;s overall gaming strategy, their past actions in terms of investments and choice of partners has lead to a dominant position within the gaming market. They are the largest shareholders in Riot Games, Bluehole, Supercell, Activision Blizzard and Epic Games.</p><p>Epic Game&#8217;s Unreal Engine is one of the two major competing games engines that underpin the development of almost every major game and 3d/graphic-based application worldwide. Their 40% stake in Epic games was possibly one of the best investments the company has ever made in this sense.</p><h4>4.3.2. Competition</h4><p>It&#8217;s clear gaming competition within China is beginning to heat up. Competitors like Alibaba, NetEase &amp; Bytedance are all heavily allocating capital towards their own gaming efforts. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-game-announced-at-netease-connect-2021">Each has released well received games in 2021</a>.</p><p>Smaller gaming studios are popping up all over the place, too. And although this may not seem like a massive threat on the surface, it only takes one viral game to knock the current no.1 off the top spot. We have seen this with titles like Rocket League, who have come from humble beginnings to being one of the most played games worldwide.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://nikopartners.com/tencents-silent-pursuit-of-global-gaming-domination/">This article goes into detail on Tencent&#8217;s increased investment in gaming.</a></p><h4>4.3.3. Investments</h4><p>A running theme throughout this deep-dive will be the high praise I give towards the capital allocation of management. Some of the investments made over the past decade have been nothing short of inspired.</p><p>With regards to the gaming portfolio, Tencent has made some impactful investments into gaming studios. They are the largest shareholders in Riot Games, Bluehole, Supercell, Activision Blizzard and Epic Games. As mentioned earlier, Epic Games is probably the most noteworthy investment here, however there is a large amount of strong IP and valuable assets within each company.</p><h4>4.3.4. E-Sports</h4><p>As talked about in great depth in my Enthusiast Gaming deep-dive, I see e-Sports as a huge growth opportunity within the gaming landscape.

The Chinese E-sports ecosystem is nuanced but also nearly impossible for eSports professionals to opt out of participating in Tencent eSports.</p><p>They essentially have a monopoly in this department.</p><h4>4.3.5. Potential risk</h4><p>As I mentioned earlier, a large risk within the gaming realm is the possibility of another gaming studio producing a massively popular game that reaches new heights. As gaming is the one of the main on-ramps to Tencent&#8217;s overall platform (and it is a large source of revenue) the company will see any competitors as a threat.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Recently, Genshin Impact (GI) &#8211; a AAA, free-to-play mobile game &#8211; launched, hitting roughly $400 million revenue in two months (on a budget of ~$100 million) and winning Best Game 2020 awards from both Apple and Google.&#8221;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The biggest takeaway from this development was the fact that these smaller gaming studios no longer NEED Tencent to be able to pull-off a big revenue generating game.</p><p>Circumventing the Tencent ecosystem, GI-creators miHoYo marketed via a range of other channels (Twitch, YouTube, Reddit, Discord, etc). They also set the first well-received example of a truly open-world, console-like experience on mobile.&nbsp;</p><p>The implications of miHoYo&#8217;s game are &#8211; in summary &#8211; that mobile-first gaming is huge and can compete with console in quality; that the Chinese studio competition is fierce and impending for East and West developers alike; and that the free-to-play model is likely the future.</p></blockquote><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/GranitebayCap/status/1427443760305119245&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;The Gaming Ecosystem!

Looking forwards</h4><p>If we are to predict what is next for Tencent within the gaming industry, they will firstly need to strengthen their gaming ecosystem over time. This could materialise in partnering with companies like Nintendo, maintaining the dominance of WeChat, or investing in companies like VSPN (the leading esports solutions provider in Asia) where these markets are set to grow over the next decade.</p><p>This raises the question of international expansion, which has never been an easy task for Chinese companies. However, Tencent are in a good position with their globally diversified investment portfolio.</p><h3>4.4. Media</h3><p>Leaving gaming out of the equation for one second, one could make an argument that Tencent is one of the most influential media companies in the world at the moment. That being said, competition is rife in this sector and has been heating up over the past two years with the rise of Bytedance and TikTok.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb40f9b7-222a-48a8-afb6-0e4f3bfb2822_1200x808.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb40f9b7-222a-48a8-afb6-0e4f3bfb2822_1200x808.jpeg" width="453" height="305.02" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bb40f9b7-222a-48a8-afb6-0e4f3bfb2822_1200x808.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:808,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:453,&quot;bytes&quot;:69086,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb40f9b7-222a-48a8-afb6-0e4f3bfb2822_1200x808.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb40f9b7-222a-48a8-afb6-0e4f3bfb2822_1200x808.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb40f9b7-222a-48a8-afb6-0e4f3bfb2822_1200x808.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb40f9b7-222a-48a8-afb6-0e4f3bfb2822_1200x808.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Because our customer attention is zero-sum (i.e. there is only so much time in the day someone can look at their phone), all of these companies are fighting tooth-and-nail for the most attention possible - and this is true for all forms of entertainment.</p><p>In online TV, Tencent (394 million monthly active users) competes with Alibaba&#8217;s Youku (394 million) and Baidu&#8217;s iQiyi (348 million).</p><p>In short form videos, Bytedance owns the market with Douyin/TikTok, but Kuaishou is a close second. This is an incredibly important battleground.</p><p>The purchasing power of these users will likely grow over time.</p><h4>4.4.1. Livestream</h4><blockquote><p><em>In July 2019, Tencent won a lawsuit giving them game copyrights in third-party live broadcast. This gave them major control over the game broadcast market. Currently, this &#8220;Twitch-for-Asia&#8221; market is dominated by Douyu and Huya (in which Tencent is the largest shareholder), who together have an 80% share of the market. Kuaishou has 18.5% and Bilibili has 17.1%, both are partially owned by Tencent, too.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>For this reason, both Douyin and Kuaishou are moving heavily into livestream, longer form video and eCommerce. Kuaishou has 300 million daily active users, of which 170 million watch livestream and 100 users engage in livestream e-commerce each day.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><h4>4.4.2. Music</h4><p>Lastly, music is another industry in which Tencent dominates. Tencent Music Entertainment (TME) is the largest music platform in China with a market cap of $30B.</p><p>The competitive advantage here is similar to that of Spotify - where they have spent vast sums acquiring music licenses and exclusive rights. Netease Music is their only real serious competitor.</p><ul><li><p>They are now looking to expand into livestreaming, online karaoke, podcasting, and offline performances.</p></li><li><p>They have developed an advertising arm of the business, which is growing at 100% y/y.</p></li><li><p>They expect podcasting users to double by 2021 end.</p></li></ul><p>Paid subscriber growth within music leaves plenty of room for improvement. Currently only 9% of users are paid subscribers, whereas Spotify boasts around 45%.</p><h3>4.5. Fintech</h3><p>Fintech is a real potential area for growth. It has been one of the fastest growing industries over the past 50 years - and with the recent tech revolution, this industry can be expected to continue its fast-paced growth.</p><p>At it&#8217;s core, the Chinese payment system is majority app-driven - mainly due to the fact that cheap mobile devices came about in a relatively short period of time. This enabled leapfrogging of the western technology development road-map.</p><p>One obvious thing is the difference between Revenue for both companies. The business models are fundamentally different and speak to the regulatory oversight of the CCP. Fin-techs in China are there (in the eyes of the government) to serve the Chinese people. Hence, they have less room to monetize than their Western counterparts. This principle carries over into WeChat advertising relative to Facebook&#8217;s, Alibaba&#8217;s GMV relative to Amazon&#8217;s, and more. (less opportunity to generate rev, but much larger base).</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b36cc31-5675-4fe3-aae9-44bcc197a166_3200x1800.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b36cc31-5675-4fe3-aae9-44bcc197a166_3200x1800.jpeg" width="1456" height="819" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8b36cc31-5675-4fe3-aae9-44bcc197a166_3200x1800.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:688417,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b36cc31-5675-4fe3-aae9-44bcc197a166_3200x1800.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b36cc31-5675-4fe3-aae9-44bcc197a166_3200x1800.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b36cc31-5675-4fe3-aae9-44bcc197a166_3200x1800.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b36cc31-5675-4fe3-aae9-44bcc197a166_3200x1800.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Both Alibaba and Tencent are investing aggressively in these thematic industries.

With gaming by far the largest slice of the pie (with some big names mentioned earlier in the article).</p><p>Outside of typical foreign territories such as Singapore and Indonesia, Tencent are beginning to invest in companies building similar super-apps to WeChat - such as SEA and Gojek.</p><p>To summarise their investment portfolio - it&#8217;s complicated, wide-reaching, large and risky. Tencent invest in almost every up-and-coming company out there, which results in heaps of potential future opportunity, alongside some short term volatility.</p><p>I believe the investment portfolio is one of the many gems within Tencent&#8217;s overall business and should not be overlooked.</p><h3>4.8. To summarize</h3><p>The &#8216;what they do&#8217; section here is understandably massive. Tencent are a vast and sprawling company with their fingers in many different pies. But the main takeaway is this. Tencent are dominant in almost every industry they operate within. If they can continue to hold off competition within each of these industries, there is no reason why they can&#8217;t remain number 1.</p><h2>5. The crackdown - what&#8217;s happening and why?</h2><p>Now that we understand what they do (as well as is humanly possible), let's figure out what is happening with Tencent within the context of China right now - and try to figure out whether the recent pullback is justified and will be sustained</p><p><strong>Quick summary before jumping into the detail:</strong></p><ol><li><p>China announced a <strong>6 month rectification plan for big tech and internet companies</strong>, including turning education businesses into non profits. These education businesses were big ad spenders for Tencent, so will have some material impact on the revenue figures.</p></li><li><p>Tencent uses some <strong>questionable tactics</strong> such as link-blocking competitors on their platforms. This has been called into question by the regulators.</p></li><li><p><strong>Regulatory pressure on WeChat Pay.</strong> Tencent's WeChat Pay holds a near-duopoly in China's online payments market with Ant Group's Alipay. However, the Chinese government wants to regulate both platforms more tightly as financial institutions -- which could cripple their ability to disrupt traditional state-run banks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Banning the merger of Huya and DouYu </strong>(provide videogame live-streaming services akin to Twitch in the U.S.)<strong>.</strong> The merger would have created a great promotional platform for its top games and expanded its streaming video presence beyond Tencent Video. Unfortunately, the market regulators blocked the deal, claiming the deal would monopolize the esports streaming market - which it would.</p></li><li><p><strong>No more exclusive music for Tencent Music.</strong> On July 24, the market regulators forced Tencent Music, which controls over 80% of China's streaming music market, to give up all of its exclusive music licensing rights. Tencent spun off Tencent Music in an IPO in late 2018, but it remains the company's biggest stakeholder.</p></li><li><p><strong>The gaming business is coming under fire</strong>, with the government looking to restrict the amount of playing time minors can have on a daily basis. Could definitely impact revenue.</p></li></ol><p>As most will be aware, the current state of Chinese stocks is a concerning matter for anyone with any amount of capital invested.&nbsp; I won&#8217;t spend too much time on this section, however I will try to outline the main point of what is causing the &#8216;nose-dive&#8217; in the price of Chinese stocks and, more importantly, why.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa67d405d-0f41-405c-b759-c897ef4dbfa8_1151x813.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa67d405d-0f41-405c-b759-c897ef4dbfa8_1151x813.png" width="1151" height="813" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a67d405d-0f41-405c-b759-c897ef4dbfa8_1151x813.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:813,&quot;width&quot;:1151,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa67d405d-0f41-405c-b759-c897ef4dbfa8_1151x813.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa67d405d-0f41-405c-b759-c897ef4dbfa8_1151x813.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa67d405d-0f41-405c-b759-c897ef4dbfa8_1151x813.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa67d405d-0f41-405c-b759-c897ef4dbfa8_1151x813.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h3>5.1. The what...</h3><p>China&#8217;s goals over the past several decades are clear - to become the largest global economic force. An interesting distinction about China, compared to most of the rest of the world, is that they are not a fully capitalist society. At least not as far as we understand it in the west.</p><p>Slowly, over time, the Chinese Communist Party has been trying to introduce different aspects of capitalism into the economy. One example of this was the establishment of the Chinese stock exchange. This re-opened in the 1990s and since then, the government has been slowly adding more capitalism-type investment vehicles to be utilized by chinese companies.</p><p>That being said, China would also be considered to be ruled by an authoritarian government/political-body. This can be a real problem for any capitalist-type business operating within China, as the ruling body (in this case the CCP) don&#8217;t like giving up their power.</p><p>As an example, the government has made a habit of making ambitious economic/political plans to allow more private investment and freedom to Chinese companies, only to backtrack shortly afterwards when they try to take back the power they have given up due to problems arising.</p><p>This has manifested in a recent backslides, in which they have dramatically increased the oversight applied to prominent Chinese technology companies who are currently listed on the stock exchange and plan to be listed on the stock exchange in the near future.</p><h3>5.2. The why</h3><p>So why does this matter? And what does this have to do with Chinese stocks in general tanking?&nbsp;</p><p>The first thing to take into consideration is the fact that the Chinese stock exchange was considered by the world at large to be only on a provisional basis. It can be treated as somewhat of an experiment by the Chinese government - dipping their toes into new waters. There were, and still are, big question marks around whether the CCP will really allow for these capitalist-style financial vehicles to operate in the way they were intended.</p><p>The market opportunity in China is massive, with the world&#8217;s largest middle class, littered with huge monetisation opportunities - but none of that matters if the Chinese government will continue to interfere/ban certain businesses to operate.</p><p>The general consensus with investors in Chinese companies is that as long as the government remains relatively hands-off, they are willing to invest. However, with this recent backtrack and outright interference in some of the major Chinese players, the Chinese government has scared many foreign investors out of the country - tanking the share price.</p><p>Adding to this - it&#8217;s important to note that the motivation behind these anti-capitalist policies and regulations isn&#8217;t simply to break up the monopolistic companies like Tencent and Alibaba for the greater good of the economy. It seems more like a knee-jerk reaction to the idea that power is being taken away from the CCP. When it&#8217;s boiled down, the CCP want to remain the most powerful entity in China, and are therefore willing to do whatever they can to achieve that goal.&nbsp;</p><p>All this being said, I have estimated the current damage to Tencent on these crackdowns on their core revenue to be somewhere between $3B - $6B (or between 4% and 6% of annual revenues). I would therefore argue that the recent pullback of +20% seems somewhat overdramatic. However, it&#8217;s difficult to know to what extent this crackdown will continue and for how long.</p><h2>6. The opportunity</h2><p>The chinese middle class is huge. Over the past several decades, the growth of the Chinese middle-class has been nothing short of exceptional. Over the next ten years, the middle class in China and the rest of Asia (areas which Tencent are targeting in particular) are projected to continue growing rapidly. For example by 2035 China will have a larger middle class than USA + Europe combined. They are targeting 35k USD per capita.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af47d80-2114-492a-b69f-b4f9ca512de1_1200x1200.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af47d80-2114-492a-b69f-b4f9ca512de1_1200x1200.jpeg" width="445" height="445" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3af47d80-2114-492a-b69f-b4f9ca512de1_1200x1200.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1200,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:445,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af47d80-2114-492a-b69f-b4f9ca512de1_1200x1200.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af47d80-2114-492a-b69f-b4f9ca512de1_1200x1200.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af47d80-2114-492a-b69f-b4f9ca512de1_1200x1200.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af47d80-2114-492a-b69f-b4f9ca512de1_1200x1200.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>China hasn't had a recession in 40 years. The regulators do their jobs and regulate. For example, the recent crackdown on the ANT IPO, where they were lending ~10k to students through a quick 2 minute form and charging 20% interest. China is good at shutting these type of things down, whereas in the US there seems to be much more leniency for this kind of activity. This proactive behavior creates short term pain but long term stability.</p><h3>6.1. Where do I see the future growth?</h3><p>Much of Tencent&#8217;s future growth relies on the continued flywheel that is WeChat and the various ancillary services surrounding that. The more Tencent are able to focus on expected growth industries, such as cloud and gaming - the better chance of continuing their substantial growth trajectory.</p><p>Some tailwinds for growth include&#8230;</p><p><strong>Industry specific tailwinds</strong></p><ul><li><p>High base rates case for gaming-industry growth. Roughly 15% per year is the base estimate which, given Tencent&#8217;s position in the market, they will likely smash.</p></li><li><p>5G being rolled out worldwide would provide tailwinds with many of their indirect investments.</p></li><li><p>Rising chinese consumer spending as the economy continues to develop.</p></li><li><p>Several areas of Tencent&#8217;s focus - e.g. cloud &amp; SaaS are severely undervalued in terms of use-cases. This is a significant area to increase monetisation.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Country-specific</strong></p><ul><li><p>Between 2010 and 2018, the Chinese GDP per capital has grown at roughly a 7% CAGR (compound annual growth rate). The forecast between 2019 and 2026 comes in at roughly 7.5%. Very few other markets are growing at these rates.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Lastly, with the ever-increasing push into</p><p>&nbsp;overseas markets, and into a more investment-centric model, I expect markets in India and Southeast Asia to underpin a chunk of growth going forward. These two countries are somewhat similar to China a couple of decades ago, and while Tencent focuses on the move to B2B within China, they will look to repeat much of their B2C growth within these markets.</p><h2>7. Tencent and the Metaverse</h2><p>I talk about the metaverse a lot - so here&#8217;s a brief thread I did a while back outlining my thoughts on what the metaverse is and how it might shape-out over the next 10 - 20 years.</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/Innovestor_/status/1391168459510276096?s=20&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;/THREAD/\n\nThe Internet changed the world and created hundreds of billionaires \n\nThe Metaverse will be 10x that and is just getting started\n\nHere's a thread on the Metaverse and how YOU can profit &#128071;&#128071;&#128071; &quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;Innovestor_&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Innovestor&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Sat May 08 23:09:42 +0000 2021&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[{&quot;img_url&quot;:&quot;https://pbs.substack.com/media/E05sVR9X0AAlVfh.jpg&quot;,&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;https://t.co/5sPgPLjlYO&quot;,&quot;alt_text&quot;:null}],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:32,&quot;like_count&quot;:120,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null}"><a href="https://twitter.com/Innovestor_/status/1391168459510276096?s=20" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-user-avatar" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/twitter_name/w_36/Innovestor_.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @Innovestor_"><span class="tweet-author-name">Innovestor </span><span class="tweet-author">@Innovestor_</span></div>/THREAD/

Users can shop, pay, play games, send gifts, personalise products amongst many other things - all without leaving the app.</p><p>This opportunity to be a metaverse-like platform is likely to represent an incomprehensible about of wealth-creation over the next 10-20 years as technology develops. And Tencent, who have strategically invested in many metaverse areas of focus (e.g. Epic Games), are in a leading position to capitalise on this opportunity.</p><h3>7.1. The building blocks</h3><p>We don&#8217;t really know what kind of &#8216;platform&#8217; the metaverse will end up being built on eventually. It could be Epic&#8217;s Unreal Engine, Nvidia&#8217;s Omniverse platform, or both, or neither. Most likely, and this is actually one of the core definitions of the metaverse, is that the platforms will be interchangeable and connected. In other words, there will be no singular platform.</p><p>Tencent&#8217;s 40% investment in Epic Games is the best opportunity (in my opinion) the company has to be able to capitalise on the potential metaverse adoption. More than likely, most applications (games, AR, VR etc) will use either Unity or Unreal Engine to build the metaverse. The Unreal Engine is the platform, Fortnite is Content. It owns 1.5% of Roblox, which has 164 million users and is played by half of people under age 16 in the United States.</p><p>Here&#8217;s a detailed thread on EPIC.</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/Innovestor_/status/1420426046189473796?s=20&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Epic Games - the story of how one man (Tim Sweeney) changed video games forever, and created a trailblaiser in the gaming industry. \n\nA thread &#129525;\n\n1&#65039;&#8419; Background\n2&#65039;&#8419; Strategy\n3&#65039;&#8419; Unity Vs Unreal\n4&#65039;&#8419; Epic Games Store\n5&#65039;&#8419; Epic Games Publishing\n6&#65039;&#8419; Epic Online Services &quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;Innovestor_&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Innovestor&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Wed Jul 28 16:48:54 +0000 2021&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[{&quot;img_url&quot;:&quot;https://pbs.substack.com/media/E7Zd9dWXoAQxq3s.png&quot;,&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;https://t.co/RMS2qMGqoT&quot;,&quot;alt_text&quot;:null}],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:19,&quot;like_count&quot;:41,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null}"><a href="https://twitter.com/Innovestor_/status/1420426046189473796?s=20" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-user-avatar" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/twitter_name/w_36/Innovestor_.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @Innovestor_"><span class="tweet-author-name">Innovestor </span><span class="tweet-author">@Innovestor_</span></div>Epic Games - the story of how one man (Tim Sweeney) changed video games forever, and created a trailblaiser in the gaming industry.

As Tencent are Snapchat&#8217;s largest shareholder at ~12%. I think snap are an important piece in the metaverse jigsaw puzzle - bridging the gap between the physical and the digital worlds.</p><h3>7.2. Audio</h3><p>Audio is beginning to make a resurgence with podcasts beginning to become the norm and daily listening times increasing. Therefore I see audio becoming a more integral part of our everyday lives.</p><p>Tencent has a 9% stake in spotify, who are best placed to capitalize on the audio opportunity. The company currently has&nbsp;</p><p>Spotify, of which Tencent owns 9%, is best positioned to capture that earshare. Spotify currently has 365 million monthly active users and are rapidly experimenting with different types of long-form spoken-word content.<a href="https://sleepwell.substack.com/p/music-streaming-royalties-101"> Sleepwell Capital is a great resource for all things spotify.</a></p><p>I believe audio will nicely fill the gap in the metaverse where people are not able to fully immerse in the digital world - offering an extra on-ramp. Additionally, audio really enhances the immersive experience that the metaverse is looking to achieve.</p><p>There is much more to be said on the relationship Tencent has with the metaverse - <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/tencents-dreams">check out Packy McCormick&#8217;s essay on this subject.</a></p><h2>8. The Bull &amp; Bear Case</h2><h3>8.1. Bull</h3><p><strong>#1 - WeChat which is a nearly impenetrable moat that Tencent will enjoy for at least another decade or two. </strong>WeChat users spent <strong>$115 billionthrough mini programs in 2019</strong> and exact figures weren&#8217;t disclosed in Tencent&#8217;s 2020 annual report but I did find that in their report that annual transaction volume from Mini programs doubled in 2020.</p><p>All of this is important because while WeChat is a dominant force, user growth has been slowing given that it already penetrates nearly all of China and so it&#8217;ll be important for Tencent to continue monetizing on its users to propel further growth.</p><p>In order to not be too repetitive, I won&#8217;t touch upon gaming and Tencent&#8217;s investment portfolio. 2nd most valuable brand in china and the 7th most valuable in the world.</p><p><strong>#2 - Resilient with strong Moat. </strong>The abnormally large scale allows Tencent to leverage scale benefits across all verticles. Integral to the Chinese consumer. Integral to most businesses in china as a point of sale, distribution channel, advertising medium and providing cloud and data infrastructure. Also integral to the asian gaming market.</p><p>Not dependent on any one supplier. Multiple successful business arms. Low marginal cost. Low to no Customer Acquisition Cost. The more they grow, the better the unit economics become. Low debt and low capital requirements. All of these factors contribute to the company&#8217;s overall resilience.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>#3 - Strong Management &amp; Culture. </strong>Tencent is still led by the core team who founded it. Great working environment with a 4.3 star rating on glassdoor. Of Tencent&#8217;s founding five, two are still executives (Pony Ma, CEO and Xu Chenye, CIO). The other three are on the advisory board. Most of the rest of the executive body have been with the company since around 2005.</p><p><strong>#4 - Live Streaming. </strong>Tencent owns a dominant <strong>37% and 38% stake in China&#8217;s largest gaming streaming sites named Huya and Douyu</strong> and has been pushing for the two companies to merge. Unfortunately for tencent, this did not pass due to monopolistic concerns, however this segment remains a huge growth opportunity which serves as a nice compliment to their gaming segment.</p><p><strong>#5 - Fintech and business services.</strong> This is the fastest growing segment of Tencent&#8217;s business (40% for Q2 y/y). Tencent has been able to take considerable share away from Alipay through Tenpay (equivalent of Paypal or Venmo) which currently accounts for about 39% of transactions<strong> -</strong> up from about 10% in 2014.</p><p>Regarding the cloud, Tencent holds the 3rd place spot in terms of market share and given that the overall industry grew by 62% in Q4 2020, I&#8217;m sure Tencent will be putting a lot of effort into this business segment.</p><p><strong>#5 - The investment portfolio. </strong>This is possibly one of the best aspects of owning Tencent, and is a smart move on the company's behalf. Creating and developing their own products would be very inefficient. The company&#8217;s best minds should be focusing on building a company that is set up to catch the next big growth wave.</p><p>Investment in some of their best bets vs ownership is smart (especially within the context of the metaverse). It will likely be wide-reaching, and we don&#8217;t know who the various winners will be. But it most likely wont be one sigle entity.</p><p>To avoid repetition - I will simply list the rest.</p><p><strong>#6 Reasonable valuation</strong></p><p><strong>#7 Strong fundamentals</strong></p><p><strong>#8 Multiple industry tailwinds</strong></p><p><strong>#9 Leader in almost all areas of operations</strong></p><h3>8.2. Bear</h3><p><strong>#1 - Regulatory risk. </strong>Unlike Jack Ma who notoriously spoke out against the party and caused many issues for Alibaba, Tencent is known to have a very strong relationship with the government. That being said, the CCP can at any time change its policies that can hurt Tencent&#8217;s business (and have done so over the past several months).</p><p>This is an ongoing risk and probably one of the largest short-term drivers of the stock price. We simply don&#8217;t know how long this will last, or how much damage will be done.</p><p><strong>#2 - International political unrest. </strong>It&#8217;s a real risk that China grows way too powerful that countries will work to limit its power, such as making Tencent sell off its US holdings if an anti-China US president came to power. What should be noted though is that Tencent&#8217;s business mostly resides in China (97%), so there would be notable but minimal impact</p><p><strong>#3 - WeChat growth is slowing and competition is heating up. </strong>As WeChat have grown to be the single largest messaging/social/business platform in all of China, user growth has inevitably began to slow. And the new kid on the block looking to eat up some of this market share is ByteDance which is the company behind Douyin / Tiktok.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tik-tok-statistics/">TikTok has over 689 million monthly active users while Douyin has over 600 million,</a></strong> and as we&#8217;ve seen with WeChat, once you have the users, your opportunities to create additional businesses are endless</p><p><strong>#4 - Tencent trades in the US as a Level 1 ADR. </strong>Level 1 ADRs trade on OTC markets and don&#8217;t need to abide by GAAP accounting which result in less reliability and transparency when it comes to reporting the numbers.&nbsp;</p><p>I find it unlikely that Tencent would commit serious fraud with their accounting, but it;s something to be aware of. There was also some talk about the US delisting Chinese ADRs so again, this is another risk.</p><p>Alternative options, as discussed in the financial section below, are to invest in Naspers or Prosus.</p><p><strong>#5 - Lacking in one single vision/goal/focus. </strong>One could argue Tencent has lost focus and drive - the company is too far-reaching and therefore lacks the direction needed to succeed long-term. It could be compared to an investment fund - not to say this is necessarily a bad thing.</p><p><strong># 6 - Competition in all areas. </strong>As mentioned earlier, competition is heating up in many of the areas they operate within. They face a behemoth of a general competitor in Alibaba, an investment competitor in Softbank, an emerging wave of entertainment competitors such as Bilibili, NetEase and Bytedance, and increasing anti monopoly regulation.</p><p><strong>#7 - Culture of Short-termism. </strong>There are several accounts knocking about that due to the sheer scale and desire to grow year on year, some members of management have been known to focus more on the short-term goals than is healthy.</p><p>In a nutshell, and this is something that happens to companies when they get too big, is that they lose the ability to innovate effectively - so they just copy ideas and acquire (look at Facebook).</p><h2>9. Financials</h2><p>I&#8217;m going to briefly go over the headline financial figures for Tencent before doing a much more thorough job at a discounted cash flow valuation in the next section as I believe that is far more important.</p><p>Tencent have a good financial history, with little debt and strong historical revenue growth. The company are highly profitable with an adjusted EBITDA of around 40%. They have roughly as much cash as they do debt.</p><p>No marginal cost for most products. Similar to the US technology gians, the more Tencent grows, the better their unit economics become. They have the leeway to be able to invest in companies/projects with poor unit economics which can be subsidesed through cash from the company&#8217;s core operations.</p><p>You may want to see a larger cash position, but Tencent is generating so much in free cash flow that it really doesn&#8217;t matter over the short-to-medium term.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75fe7a58-68bf-4248-861b-9467ee261c90_513x175.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75fe7a58-68bf-4248-861b-9467ee261c90_513x175.png" width="513" height="175" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/75fe7a58-68bf-4248-861b-9467ee261c90_513x175.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:175,&quot;width&quot;:513,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75fe7a58-68bf-4248-861b-9467ee261c90_513x175.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75fe7a58-68bf-4248-861b-9467ee261c90_513x175.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75fe7a58-68bf-4248-861b-9467ee261c90_513x175.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75fe7a58-68bf-4248-861b-9467ee261c90_513x175.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h3>9.1. Cash Flow</h3><p>The cash flow statement is extremely strong. But what is really impressive is the way in which Tencent re-invest back into its businesses using cash generated from the core operating businesses. This is what&#8217;s leading to its fast, sustained, compounding growth.</p><p>If we run a quick eye over the cash flow statement, we can see the substantial cash from operations coming into the business. At the same time, we can also see a significant, and almost precise, outflow of cash towards investing activities. This is cash coming straight in and heading straight out the door. In other words, they are utilising every bit of cash-flow they make in order to invest and compound at a greater rate. Exactly what we want to see to indicate longevity.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc57ca4b-6682-4ab6-8c52-f5dba39b4b73_843x491.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc57ca4b-6682-4ab6-8c52-f5dba39b4b73_843x491.jpeg" width="843" height="491" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bc57ca4b-6682-4ab6-8c52-f5dba39b4b73_843x491.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:491,&quot;width&quot;:843,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc57ca4b-6682-4ab6-8c52-f5dba39b4b73_843x491.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc57ca4b-6682-4ab6-8c52-f5dba39b4b73_843x491.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc57ca4b-6682-4ab6-8c52-f5dba39b4b73_843x491.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc57ca4b-6682-4ab6-8c52-f5dba39b4b73_843x491.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h3>9.2.

Buy Tencent at a discount?</h3><p>While researching, I kept coming across Naspers and Prosus as potential alternatives to investing in Tencent at a &#8216;discount&#8217;. Lets find out what all this means&#8230;</p><h4>What is Naspers?</h4><p>Naspers took the decision to buy a 46.5% stake of Tencent in 2001. The ownership stake was diluted when Tencent decided to ipo. The total cost basis of that Tencent investment was 32 million dollars back then, which has turned into over $200B today as Tencent has become one of the most dominant internet giants not only in china but globally. </p><p>That is a CAGR of approximately 55%, which is insane. As a result of this Investment, Naspers market cap has grown to the point of dominating the South African stock exchange. Even today, Naspers accounts for 22% of the South African index.</p><p>However, this poses a problem. since many institutional investors in South Africa are forced to sell out of the Naspers investment in order to reduce the concentration risk in their portfolio. The sustained selling of the stock along with the limited float resulted in a reduction in the price of Naspers shares.</p><p>In order to address this discount, Naspers management decided to organize a spin-off in the form of &#8216;Prosus&#8217;.</p><h4>Prosus</h4><p>September 2019 saw Naspers list Prosus on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. With the idea that the formation of Prosus would give the company more liquidity from a new diverse base of investors.</p><p>The new listing would reduce the problem that Naspers had where they were dominating the entire South African index. This spin-off would be allocated the entire Tencent stake and other investments that Naspers previously controlled.</p><p>The listing was a massive success - with the initial listing price prediction of 58.7 euros Prosus exceed this, shooting up to a range of around 76 euros.</p><p>So, If you&#8217;re looking at Prosus or Naspers, you&#8217;re not really looking at an investment in Tencent, but more the capability of the management team to manage the capital. Most likely, Naspers and Prosus will never sell their stake in Tencent. </p><p>My opinion is that if you are looking to invest in Tencent, don&#8217;t over-complicate it. Unless you are truly knowledgeable about the management of either Naspers or Prosus, don&#8217;t in what is essentially a derivative of a derivative. There are plenty of risks to already consider with owning Tencent without adding an extra layer of complexity.</p><h1>10. Conclusion</h1><p>I&#8217;ll keep this conclusion short, mainly because the article ended up being so long. However, I think the opportunity present here is great.</p><p>I believe Tencent has pretty-much everything we&#8217;re looking for in a good investment opportunity - resilient business, strong investment portfolio with an eye towards the future, huge growth tailwinds in multiple industries, dominant in almost every area of operation, impenetrable moat and &#8216;metaverse-ready&#8217; (amongst other things).</p><p>All risks considered, the company is trading at a relatively reasonable valuation level. I strongly believe the potential upside here far outweighs the risk.</p><p>For full disclosure, I have already initiated a 3% portfolio position in Tencent at an initial cost basis of ~$59, with the aim of gradually adding over the coming years. This is a good practice for any investment in order to manage risk, but in this case I wan&#8217;t to manage the downside as much as possible.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Innovestor  </p><div><hr></div><p>Some thanks:</p><ol><li><p>Special thanks to both of Pacy McCormick&#8217;s Tencent articles (<a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/tencent-the-ultimate-outsider">One</a>, and <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/tencents-dreams">two</a>) where he goes into great depth on the history aspect and has done some amazing ground-work on the investment portfolio analysis.</p></li><li><p>Special thanks to <a href="https://vineyardholdings.net/tencent/#_ftn2">Vineyard Holdings</a> article who goes into vast detail on Tencent, and moreso within the context of China.</p></li></ol>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Big changes ahead]]></title><description><![CDATA[I'm going premium...]]></description><link>https://innovestor.substack.com/p/big-changes-ahead</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://innovestor.substack.com/p/big-changes-ahead</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Innovestor]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 11:02:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F799c2d36-8b3f-4be3-b793-5e38b6def327_2844x1080.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F799c2d36-8b3f-4be3-b793-5e38b6def327_2844x1080.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F799c2d36-8b3f-4be3-b793-5e38b6def327_2844x1080.png" width="1456" height="553" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/799c2d36-8b3f-4be3-b793-5e38b6def327_2844x1080.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:553,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1321767,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F799c2d36-8b3f-4be3-b793-5e38b6def327_2844x1080.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F799c2d36-8b3f-4be3-b793-5e38b6def327_2844x1080.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F799c2d36-8b3f-4be3-b793-5e38b6def327_2844x1080.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F799c2d36-8b3f-4be3-b793-5e38b6def327_2844x1080.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I&#8217;m excited to share with you a big announcement I have been considering for a while.</p><p>I have decided to go <strong>all in</strong> on the Innovestor Newsletter by introducing a <strong>premium tier </strong>where I will be producing deep-dives on innovative growth stocks every 3 weeks.</p><p>Several points before I get into the detail:</p><ul><li><p><strong>A massive thank-you </strong>to everyone who has supported me over the past 9 months. There are so many great options out there when it comes to investment content, so I&#8217;m eternally grateful to anyone and everyone who has included my newsletter in their readings. I fully anticipate not everyone will be joining me on the next step of my journey, but still wanted to thank you all.</p></li><li><p>There will still be a <strong>tonne of free content</strong> on the way, so keep tuning in!</p></li></ul><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://innovestor.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://innovestor.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h2>Why the change?</h2><p>Firstly I would like to talk about the reasons for making the switch from free to paid, as there are several important points&#8230;</p><ol><li><p><strong>My goals &#8211; </strong>the main goal for me is to be able to commit 100% of my time to this publication. At the moment I work my 9-5 and focus on the Innovestor Newsletter in my free time.

The companies I investigate tend to be technology-based SaaS companies, however it can vary. Examples of past deep-dives include:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://innovestor.substack.com/p/mercadolibre-deep-dive">MercadoLibre</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://innovestor.substack.com/p/roku-deep-dive">Roku</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://innovestor.substack.com/p/enthusiast-gaming-eglx-deep-dive">Enthusiast Gaming</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://innovestor.substack.com/p/uber-deep-dive">Uber</a></p></li></ul><p>And many more.</p><p>The next deep-dive (exclusive to premium subscribers) <strong>will be on Tencent</strong> &#8211; one of the more fascinating and wide-reaching companies in the world. &#8220;<em>Is the company&#8217;s recent contraction in price a bargain or a trap?&#8221;</em> We&#8217;ll find out on <strong>Friday 3rd August</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the upcoming deep dive suggestions include:</p><ul><li><p>Crowdstrike - $CRWD</p></li><li><p>AMD - $AMD</p></li><li><p>Evolution Gaming - $EVO</p></li><li><p>SoFi - $SOFI</p></li><li><p>Cloudfare - $NET</p></li><li><p>Etsy - $ETSY</p></li><li><p>GoodRx - $GDRX</p></li><li><p>Growgeneration Corp - $GRWG</p></li><li><p>Upstart - $UPST</p></li></ul><p>These, among others, can only be voted on by premium subscribers.</p><p>Ultimately, the premium subscription means you will have full access to my analysis for every company I research &#8211; with the ability to ask questions and discuss.</p><h2>Who is this for?</h2><p>This service is targeted towards curious, savvy investors with an interest in growth companies. You are someone who is interested by &#8216;next-gen&#8217; industries such as VR/AR, Cloud, edge, gaming, SaaS, marketplace businesses and AI &amp; Machine Learning.

That&#8217;s $11.99 per month or $96 per year (still a 33% discount for the yearly sub). Once purchased, <strong>the price will be locked in forever (i.e. it will never increase).</strong></p><p>This is a premium service providing critical and unique insights into &#8216;growth&#8217; and &#8216;mature growth&#8217; stocks within the most interesting next-gen industries in the world. You won&#8217;t get this specific insight anywhere else.</p><p>The first post comes out this Friday at 4pm BST (11am ET), which will delve into the deep-waters of Chinese technology giant, <strong>Tencent ($TCEHY)</strong>. I cover the entire business, it&#8217;s context within the current Chinese crackdown, their investment portfolio and my take on a fair price.</p><p>After this, <strong>you </strong>will be a part of the decision as to which company I cover next.</p><h2>Discounts</h2><p>I want this service to be accessible to everyone, regardless of background or current situation. High quality research should be inclusive.</p><p>Therefore, if you e-mail me at&nbsp;<strong>innovestor1@gmail.com&nbsp;</strong>we can work out an aggressive discount that meets your current situation.</p><p>I am open to negotiating on group discounts.</p><p>I will also be offering a 30% discount for students &amp; academics (only works with .edu e-mails).</p><div><hr></div><p><em>Are you are a savvy, curious investor, interested to learn about some of the most exciting growth companies in the world?</em></p><p><em>Have my previous deep-dives been useful in making investment decisions?</em></p><p><em>Do you want a consistent, high-quality, easy to digest feed of analysis and commentary on these exciting companies and industries?</em></p><div><hr></div><p>If yes, then subscribe to the Innovestor Newsletter today.

Sometimes completely original, oftentimes not.</p><p>So the age old question of whether (or not) your idea is wholly original, and can therefore be used for commercial gain(?), is highly debated.</p><p>In this article I will be exploring several examples of how Intellectual property (IP) has been leveraged by businesses, and how we (as investors) can use this information to benefit our investing process. I will also explore the relationship between Intellectual property and the financial performance of businesses, and to try to understand whether a link exists. In addition, I will look at some examples of companies who have surfed the wave of IP over the past several decades and why (or why not) IP might be an important factor moving forwards. </p><h3>2. Introduction</h3><p>As we have transitioned from &#8216;physical to digital&#8217; in many aspects of our lives over the past several decades (<a href="https://innovestor.substack.com/p/were-at-the-beginning-of-a-digital">see my piece on the technological revolution</a>), the ease and replicability of ideas (mainly in SaaS technology companies) has increased.</p><p>It is now relatively easy to create a product mimicking someone else&#8217;s concept. </p><p>There are many examples of copyright law being misused in order to further ones financial gain. However, there are also plenty of examples outlining why it is an important safety net for creators.</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Intellectual property protection is critical to fostering innovation. Without protection of ideas, businesses and individuals would not reap the full benefits of their inventions and would focus less on research and development. Similarly, artists would not be fully compensated for their creations and cultural vitality would suffer as a result.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><h3>3. The art of leveraging IP within entertainment</h3><p>Entertainment covers many different industries - TV/Film, Music, Gaming, Theater&#8230; the list goes on.

On one side, it protects your creative work from being ripped-off and others profiting from your idea. However, there are plenty of examples where IP laws actively stifle people from using other creative work as inspiration.</p><p>In order to understand this conflict, we need look no further than the man (and company) who essentially shaped our current intellectual property landscape - Walt Disney.</p><p>In 1928, Walt created the character Oswald the Lucky Rabbit for Universal Studios. Oswald was wildly successful. However when Disney approached Universal about making more Oswald cartoons, he found out that the studio was already working on new Oswald shorts without him. And because they owned the rights, he couldn't do anything about it.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe5c26cc6-7834-4c5f-a819-1edc17bb9b6c_1024x576.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe5c26cc6-7834-4c5f-a819-1edc17bb9b6c_1024x576.jpeg" width="411" height="231.1875" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e5c26cc6-7834-4c5f-a819-1edc17bb9b6c_1024x576.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:576,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:411,&quot;bytes&quot;:69505,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe5c26cc6-7834-4c5f-a819-1edc17bb9b6c_1024x576.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe5c26cc6-7834-4c5f-a819-1edc17bb9b6c_1024x576.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe5c26cc6-7834-4c5f-a819-1edc17bb9b6c_1024x576.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe5c26cc6-7834-4c5f-a819-1edc17bb9b6c_1024x576.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Walt was far from happy. Out of a mixture of rage and jealousy, he decided he would only work for himself and that everything he created from this point forwards would be owned by him.</p><p>Walt then developed a new character, making sure it belonged to him - and him alone. As you could probably guess, it was &#8216;Mickey Mouse&#8217;. This is where the real story begins, the story about how Walt managed to change IP landscape in Disney&#8217;s favor, forever.</p><p>His plan worked well. Walt Disney now owns possibly the largest, and most popular, collection of characters, franchises and studios on the plant.</p><p>After Walt bought the rights to Mickey Mouse in 1928 - the laws at the time only allowed copyright to last 28 years (with the option of an extended 28 years) before going back into the &#8216;public domain&#8217; to be used freely. Therefore, Mickey should have become free for the public to use in 1984.</p><p>HOWEVER, in 1978 Disney petitioned congress to increase the life of their revenue generating asset. The <strong>Copyright Act of 1976</strong> was ultimately signed by Congress.&nbsp;Under this Act, copyright <strong>protection for&nbsp;already-published corporate copyrights&nbsp;(like Mickey Mouse)&nbsp;was extended to to 75 years.</strong> Works published after 1922 were entitled to a full 75 years of protection. That extended Mickey&#8217;s copyright through to <strong>2003</strong>. </p><p>HOWEVER (again), in 1998 the copyright extension act (affectionately known as the Mickey Mouse Law) was passed - <strong>extending rights for 70 years after the authors death</strong> and protecting corporate works for <strong>95 years from the original obligation, or 120 years from the creation</strong> (whichever expires first).</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1214ab0-4bbc-420a-9efd-3f4ff9136a71_1920x1188.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1214ab0-4bbc-420a-9efd-3f4ff9136a71_1920x1188.png" width="591" height="365.72184065934067" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a1214ab0-4bbc-420a-9efd-3f4ff9136a71_1920x1188.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:901,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:591,&quot;bytes&quot;:106700,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1214ab0-4bbc-420a-9efd-3f4ff9136a71_1920x1188.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1214ab0-4bbc-420a-9efd-3f4ff9136a71_1920x1188.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1214ab0-4bbc-420a-9efd-3f4ff9136a71_1920x1188.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1214ab0-4bbc-420a-9efd-3f4ff9136a71_1920x1188.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Disney spent over $6.3 million on lobbying for this act, which pales in comparison to the revenue the company will be protecting by getting this law enacted.</p><p>So, in essence, Disney have taken most of their ideas for characters directly from the public domain in order to milk their IP as long as possible. Mickey becomes free to use in 2024, but it remains to be seen whether this will be extended further.</p><h4>Why is this good (or bad) for individuals and businesses?</h4><p>The actions Disney have taken in order to retain their &#8216;assets&#8217; are debatable on a number of levels. However the main issue revolves around Disney&#8217;s hypocritical method of taking IP straight out of the public domain, copyrighting it, and then meticulously suing anyone in breech of the IP. Additionally, these copyright laws will be in play for Disney way after the death of their creator.</p><p>Is this fair? Shouldn&#8217;t Walt&#8217;s work fall into the public domain? Who knows.</p><p>For businesses, the answer to the question of whether the generous IP laws are good or bad(?), heavily depends on your point of view. </p><p>More often than not, this level of &#8216;idea protection&#8217; is a useful tool in order to protect the hard graft one puts in to create an idea. If we use the example of James Dyson, a singular inventor working at his workshop for years and years before any success. Eventually releasing his patented new method of suction for hoovers. The idea of IP allowed Mr Dyson to avoid any large corporation simply copying his idea by using their massive resources - the core danger for most inventors.</p><div><hr></div><p>On a side-note, this podcast involves a great interview with James Dyson which goes into his history, and how he worked hard to create what is now one of the worlds most well known brands.</p><iframe class="spotify-wrap podcast" data-attrs="{&quot;image&quot;:&quot;https://i.scdn.co/image/44943bef968cc94cb3fb891d14ad2dfc8612580f&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Dyson: James Dyson&quot;,&quot;subtitle&quot;:&quot;By NPR&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Podcast episode&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.spotify.com/episode/2z0qW49LqJr4U01sepHEIU&quot;}" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/2z0qW49LqJr4U01sepHEIU" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe><div><hr></div><p>On the other hand, you could argue that these IP laws benefit mainly large companies like Netflix, Nintendo, ActivisionBlizzard, Qualcomm etc. who, if they can afford to do so, can buy up as much IP as possible and milk it for as long as possible.</p><p>Great. But how does this impact innovation?</p><p>IP with a long shelf life essentially stifles innovation. Part of the push-back from creators is that most ideas stem, in one way or another, from the works of previous creators.</p><p>Disney, and other large &#8216;IP rich&#8217; corporations, make a point to sue any infringements on their copyright. This leaves creators and businesses in a precarious positions as to whether to even pursue content creation due to the fear of needing to pay up. This is a common argument as to why these IP laws stifle innovation and creativity.</p><h4>The moral question&#8230;</h4><p>As a creator of content myself, there is a fine line to tread between taking inspiration from other peoples ideas, and &#8216;stealing&#8217; ideas. Oftentimes, to get around this I will aim to add my spin on an idea, and if I can&#8217;t, I will link the source.</p><p>But deeper than this, it is my belief that ideas compound over time. I.e. ideas, for the most part, aren&#8217;t created in a vacuum - they are the product of building on past ideas and iterating in order to improve.</p><p>A good example of this is in modern music. It&#8217;s staggering to know how much great music is derived directly from older motifs. Take the below video looking at all of the samples in <strong>Kanye West&#8217;s &#8216;Graduation&#8217; album</strong> (one of my all-time favorites).</p><div id="youtube2-CfKMv4TYziQ" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;CfKMv4TYziQ&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:&quot;47&quot;,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CfKMv4TYziQ?start=47&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>With regards to writing, the problem isn&#8217;t so bad, however in TV, film and music, the problem can lead to stifled innovation if IP is &#8216;locked-up&#8217;. I believe it&#8217;s a common experience for rap artists where they need to get the approval of the right-holders on various samples, which can delay and even stop the production of the album.</p><p>So, you decide, has Disney&#8217;s impact on IP law been a net positive or negative?</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://innovestor.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://innovestor.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h3>4.

The positive contributions of intellectual property to financial performance arise predominantly from the firms&#8217; investments in patents, trade secrets and trademarks, rather than from their investment in copyright-protected items or from obtaining licenses to use technology from external sources.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><h4>What do we learn from this research?</h4><h5>For investors:</h5><ol><li><p>Use this knowledge as a heuristic (rule of thumb). For example, if you come across a company which you notice has a tonne of IP stacked away - generally speaking, this could be a very positive point to consider. However, it all depends on quality, which is hard to judge.</p></li><li><p>Take into account the importance of R&amp;D. If nothing else, let this be a reminder that R&amp;D is important for growth - so pay attention to that line item in the income statement.</p></li></ol><h5>For business owners/management:</h5><ol><li><p>Improving business performance will generally involve more than simply investing more heavily in R&amp;D or increasing commercial production. <em>&#8220;It appears a business must simultaneously invest in building up an appropriate IP portfolio for it to reap the financial rewards of building up R&amp;D or production.&#8221;</em></p></li><li><p>Employing the right mix of IP rights is key. <em>&#8220;While patents clearly have a central role to play in the business of technology firms, other types of intellectual property such as trade secrets or trademarks are clearly also important.&#8221;</em></p></li><li><p><em>&#8220;While the cost of obtaining, maintaining and enforcing intellectual property rights can be very high&#8212;especially for small, entrepreneurial firms, including start-ups&#8212;the research presented here suggests that, on the whole, it is a price worth paying.&#8221;</em>  </p></li></ol><h3>5. IP within medicine</h3><p>Medicine is possibly the most prolific use-case for intellectual property rights. The core idea is to protect the intellectual property of innovators (in this case, drug companies) in order to incentivise R&amp;D activity.</p><p> The problem lies with big pharmaceutical companies attempting to patent features of drugs not representing true innovation. This act stifles competition by discouraging competitors from entering a market due to a large financial barrier to entry.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39bf1964-4887-4cf4-809a-189777adcb5b_1920x1193.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39bf1964-4887-4cf4-809a-189777adcb5b_1920x1193.jpeg" width="581" height="361.1298076923077" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/39bf1964-4887-4cf4-809a-189777adcb5b_1920x1193.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:905,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:581,&quot;bytes&quot;:350742,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39bf1964-4887-4cf4-809a-189777adcb5b_1920x1193.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39bf1964-4887-4cf4-809a-189777adcb5b_1920x1193.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39bf1964-4887-4cf4-809a-189777adcb5b_1920x1193.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39bf1964-4887-4cf4-809a-189777adcb5b_1920x1193.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>A legal scholar, Michael Heller, calls this the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_anticommons">&#8216;tragedy of the anticommons&#8217;</a>. Heller argues that while privatizing a commons might stop wasteful overuse, it can also cause wasteful under-use.</p><p>To expand, if everything is copyrighted and the &#8216;idea&#8217; landscape becomes so sparse and fragmented, it becomes extremely difficult for businesses and individuals to create something new. Neither the public nor competitive copyright holders are willing/able to collaborate with each other.</p><p>A useful analogy I found is to think of the public domain as a warehouse stocked full with ideas. Anyone can dip into this warehouse to use, re-use, sample, alter and incorporate into their work in order to create something new. If the warehouse is depleted, there is less inspiration to create something new. </p><p>Michael Heller gives the example of a drug company<strong> </strong>that found a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease. In order to develop it, they needed access to dozens of other patents. The owners of those patents demanded ridiculous sums of money, and some even blocked the whole deal.</p><p>This resulted in the company never accessing the patents. And the drug, which might have saved millions of lives, sits on a shelf.</p><p>From stories like these to artists feeling terrified by huge corporations, its no wonder there has been a rise of groups advocating for change. Ranging from the elimination of bio-patents to the legalization of peer-to-peer file sharing.</p><div><hr></div><h5><a href="https://www.theglobalipcenter.com/resources/why-is-ip-important/">Stats</a> (Global Innovation Policy Center)</h5><ul><li><p>America&#8217;s IP is worth $6.6 trillion, more than the nominal GDP of any other country in the world.</p></li><li><p>IP-intensive industries account for over 1/3&#8211; or 38.2%&#8211; of total U.S. GDP.</p></li><li><p>IP accounts for 52% of all U.S. merchandise exports- which amounts to nearly $842 billion.</p></li><li><p>The direct and indirect economic impacts of innovation are overwhelming, accounting for more than 40% of U.S. economic growth and employment.</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h3>6. Examples of companies with powerful IP</h3><p>There are many unique and valuable instances of Intellectual property out there. If there&#8217;s one thing I want you, the reader, to take away from this article is that having IP (in and of itself) isn&#8217;t the most valuable thing. It&#8217;s how the company are able to utilize their IP in order to create something great.</p><p>Your ability to recognize valuable IP as an investor will be a useful tool in order to help distinguish between a good company and a great company. </p><p>Below are several examples of companies with valuable IP and my reasoning behind why I think they will succeed long-term. It goes without saying that there are many more not mentioned below.</p><h4>Nintendo</h4><p>Nintendo follow a similar playbook to Disney, but are ultimately a very different company. Nintendo own some of the most valuable IP on the planet which they monetise via multiple avenues - games, theme parks, books, TV, Film. </p><p>Fun fact, Nintendo holds 11 of the top 20 (and 6 of the top 10) spots on the list of <em><strong>all-time game sales</strong></em>.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3227866-cb85-419a-94bf-7f6a3c7f4c44_910x755.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3227866-cb85-419a-94bf-7f6a3c7f4c44_910x755.png" width="565" height="468.7637362637363" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f3227866-cb85-419a-94bf-7f6a3c7f4c44_910x755.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:755,&quot;width&quot;:910,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:565,&quot;bytes&quot;:133492,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3227866-cb85-419a-94bf-7f6a3c7f4c44_910x755.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3227866-cb85-419a-94bf-7f6a3c7f4c44_910x755.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3227866-cb85-419a-94bf-7f6a3c7f4c44_910x755.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3227866-cb85-419a-94bf-7f6a3c7f4c44_910x755.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h4>Qualcomm</h4><p>It&#8217;s hard to see how Qualcomm won&#8217;t benefit from the shift to 5G, seeing as they will essentially own a large amount of the infrastructure.</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;With over 130 5G licensing agreements, Qualcomm&#8217;s industry-leading, highly valuable, and fundamental 5G innovations are the most widely licensed in the industry&#8212;including multiyear patent license agreements with every major handset OEM.

Independently producing content meant that Netflix gained the opportunity to take a step back from licensing deals.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><h4>ActivisionBlizzard, Gamesworkshop, EA, EPIC, RIOT</h4><p>Lastly, Gaming is an area I could have written an entire article on but have decided to leave to another time.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe5c759ee-1bea-4b4d-b5ce-26cb506a2a94_1175x529.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe5c759ee-1bea-4b4d-b5ce-26cb506a2a94_1175x529.png" width="1175" height="529" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e5c759ee-1bea-4b4d-b5ce-26cb506a2a94_1175x529.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:529,&quot;width&quot;:1175,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:102204,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe5c759ee-1bea-4b4d-b5ce-26cb506a2a94_1175x529.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe5c759ee-1bea-4b4d-b5ce-26cb506a2a94_1175x529.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe5c759ee-1bea-4b4d-b5ce-26cb506a2a94_1175x529.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe5c759ee-1bea-4b4d-b5ce-26cb506a2a94_1175x529.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Games are becoming the place where most young people spend the majority of their time - especially over the pandemic.

Thesis</h2><p>Uber sits nicely in the small group of companies I like to call &#8216;verb stocks&#8217;. By this I am referring to a situation where a brand name has edged its way into our everyday vocabulary, resulting in what is basically free marketing for the respective companies.</p><p>Good examples of such &#8216;verb stocks&#8217; include Google (&#8220;google it&#8221;), Zoom (&#8220;Lets Zoom this afternoon&#8221;) and DocuSign (&#8220;Can you DocuSign the contract?&#8221;) etc.</p><p>This alone doesn&#8217;t create a compelling thesis to invest in the company - there are plenty of examples of companies who were once used in a similar way but we no longer use.</p><p>Over and above this initial observation, Uber is a pioneer of the gig-economy. They offer a well used and (mostly efficient) product that has quite literally paved the way for a whole host of other gig-economy/freelance companies. One of the best things to come from modern tech, and more specifically Uber, is that if you want to earn a bit of extra money on the side, you can.</p><p>Lastly, Uber has some incredibly valuable underlying assets that engulf many different industries - mobility, food delivery, transit and Autonomous Vehicles. These businesses on their own could be incredibly valuable businesses. The real kicker is how valuable these businesses will be when they converge into one delivery/travel super app by leveraging the unique and vast two-sided network the company has been building over the past decade. </p><p>Uber are creating serious momentum at the at the moment from all areas of the business. All of this at what looks a reasonable price compared to other big tech.</p><p>All this being said, I&#8217;m torn on the stock as it stands. The extreme market competition, poor unit economics, lack of path to profitability and continuous cash burn are signs of a company that will continue to struggle in the future.</p><p>In this deep dive I will try to tell both sides of the story, hoping you will find this a useful data-point in coming to your own conclusion on the stock.</p><h2>2. Key Takeaways</h2><h4>General points</h4><ul><li><p>Optionality is staggering and Uber are continuously adding. The new(ish) Ads on Eats could be a huge opportunity (potentially over 70% gross margin). <em>"Our original goal was to exit this year with $100M of Ads run-rate revenue, but we now expect to surpass that goal and end 2022 with at least $300M in run-rate revenues"</em>  </p></li><li><p>Continued growth in other aspects of the business including Eats and Freight. </p><p><em>"Freight has successfully disrupted the freight brokerage market with our innovative technology, and is now one of the largest digital freight brokers globally excluding China" </em></p><p><em>"Our acquisition of Postmates has helped us establish Eats as a #1 position in LA, the second largest Delivery market in the US, while allowing us to execute organically to establish category leadership in NYC at the same time"  </em></p></li><li><p><strong>Total of $20B in liquid and equity stakes</strong> - for reference, &#8220;<em>Q2 &#8216;<strong>profit&#8217;</strong> was mainly driven by the <strong>unrealized </strong>gain in having a stake in Didi as well as a $471m <strong>Unrealized </strong>gain on their Aurora investment.&#8221;</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Improving driver churn</strong> with &#8216;Uber Pass&#8217; - <em>"..the retention rate for our cohorts that are with us more than six months is now 98% retention rate on a month-on-month basis."</em></p></li><li><p>Path to profitability is uncertain.</p></li><li><p>Unit economics look poor.</p></li></ul><h4>Q2 2021 highlights</h4><ul><li><p>Active drivers up 75% y/y, new drivers up 30% MoM even as incentives are being tapered.</p></li><li><p>Eats is driving user acquisition for rides. <em>&#8220;+20% of mobility&#8217;s first time riders in the US and +40% of first time riders in the UK were existing Delivery consumers&#8221;.</em></p></li><li><p>Uber are locking in their most loyal customers with their subscription product, Uber Pass. <em>"drives 30% of Delivery GBs in the US, and roughly 25% globally. Consumers who regularly engage with both Mobility and Delivery now account for nearly half of our total company GB"</em>  </p></li><li><p>Uber Eats continues to grow their market share. <em>"And our leadership position continues to grow. We are now the category leader in 8 of our top 10 Delivery markets, with clear #2 positions in the US and UK"  </em></p></li><li><p>Incentives likely to stay high in Q3</p></li></ul><h2>3. Background</h2><p>Uber was founded in 2009 by Garrett Camp and Travis Kalanick with the name &#8216;UberCab&#8217;.</p><p>The idea for Uber was built on the personal experiences of the co-founders. Allegedly on New Years eve of the previous year, Garret Camp spent over $800 dollars on a private car service, which then inspired him to come up with a more affordable solution to private-hire transport.</p><p>After significant market research, Camp and Kalanick hired technical experts to determine if the project had legs. Following this, the first Uber ride was undertaken in 2010 in San Fransisco.</p><p>The company continued to develop other similar products such as UberX, UberBlack and UberPool - with eventual expansion into the food delivery market in 2014 - to later be known as Uber Eats.</p><p>Fast forward to 2021 and Uber are continuing to add more strings to their bow, with Uber Freight, ATG, some micro-mobility plays and much more.</p><h2>4. Business Model Overview</h2><p>At it&#8217;s core Uber is a matchmaker for those seeking a service, and those providing it. Originally, this manifested in the ride-sharing app, but quickly expanded into other verticals such as food and trucking. There are probably too many aspects (established and emerging) to cover in this one article, however lets go over the main ones - rides, deliveries, Freight and ATG, exploring some of the unit economics at play.</p><h4>4.1 Moat</h4><p>But before all of that, lets talk about the moat and what makes Uber unique.</p><p>At the very core of Uber&#8217;s business is a very robust and hard to replicate two-sided network of drivers and passengers. In a traditional taxi market, there can only ever be a certain number of taxi&#8217;s at any given time. This puts a cap on supply therefore forcing prices up and increasing wait times. </p><p>The more liquid one side of the market is, the more valuable it is to the other side.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dbf4f0a-9de1-49e0-bfa8-9fe6bcb751ae_842x310.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dbf4f0a-9de1-49e0-bfa8-9fe6bcb751ae_842x310.png" width="842" height="310" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3dbf4f0a-9de1-49e0-bfa8-9fe6bcb751ae_842x310.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:310,&quot;width&quot;:842,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:49727,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dbf4f0a-9de1-49e0-bfa8-9fe6bcb751ae_842x310.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dbf4f0a-9de1-49e0-bfa8-9fe6bcb751ae_842x310.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dbf4f0a-9de1-49e0-bfa8-9fe6bcb751ae_842x310.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3dbf4f0a-9de1-49e0-bfa8-9fe6bcb751ae_842x310.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>This two-sided network has grown significantly over time to become the largest global network of drivers and users.</p><p>Part of the &#8216;moat&#8217; here is the difficulty for any one company to easily replicate what Uber do - expanding into most major cities in the world is not an easy, quick or cheap thing to do. They have also been met with significant local blockers such as the disruption of local taxi businesses.</p><p>On the other hand, one of the business model&#8217;s great drawbacks is the inherent &#8216;physical&#8217; nature. For example, if your modern online tech giant such as Facebook or Snapchat wanted to expand into Germany, it&#8217;s a relatively simple process with almost 0 extra cost associated. However, Uber on the other hand need to have a physical presence in every city they expand to. This includes developing infrastructure by inspecting cars, running background checks, creating a two-sided marketplace where there was none previously - the list goes on. Physically scaling has always been an issue for Uber.</p><p>Above and beyond the ridesharing segment of the business, the moat for the wider business is the synergistic nature of the different arms of Uber. Drivers will typically deliver for Uber Eats if the opportunity arises, and vice versa.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230;+20% of mobility&#8217;s first time riders in the US and +40% of first time riders in the UK were existing Delivery consumers&#8221;.</p></blockquote><p>The end goal here is to create one &#8216;super app&#8217; - combining and converging the various vectors into one efficient delivery service (rides, eats, freights, smaller mobility, stakes in other ridesharing companies, potential for AV in the future, Uber pass, Uber for business, more high-margin/kg deliveries such as cannabis/alcohol/other high-ticket items). </p><p>If you are willing to think outside the box and are comfortable waiting a long time, this future seems very plausable.</p><h4>4.2 Broad strategy</h4><p>As hinted above, the overarching strategy here relies on becoming/remaining the dominant player in each of the mentioned verticals - eventually creating a delivery super app. I think their mission statement puts it nicely&#8230;</p><blockquote><h5>Mission Statement:</h5><p>&#8220;Transportation as reliable as running water, everywhere for everyone.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Increasing liquidity by integrating various modes of mobility into one app is a long-term goal for the company.

The trouble was that Uber ended up with some bad press due to the displacement of the traditional taxi industry - essentially showing the taxi industry that they were not safe.</p><p>As someone who is personally &#8216;pro-innovation&#8217; and &#8216;pro-disruption&#8217;, I think this shift to a new business model is an overall net benefit. Change happens in every industry. That being said, there are still substantial question marks around the treatment of the drivers.</p><ul><li><p>Business model hinges on paying drivers as private contractors.</p></li><li><p>Uber don&#8217;t own their own cars, therefore no physical assets.</p></li><li><p>Historically unprofitable.</p></li></ul><p>The question is, how does this business model work on a unit basis? Does the company actually make any money? And is it scaleable in order to achieve profitability over the longer-term? </p><p>Lets take a look.</p><h4>4.3.1. Mobility Unit Economics</h4><p> The fee Uber takes from its driver&#8217;s gross booking figure (per ride) varies and is dependent on market conditions and any incentives/surge pricing introduced by Uber at any given time. </p><blockquote><p><em>Jalopnik asked ride-hailing drivers to share fare receipts, and it received data from&nbsp;<a href="https://jalopnik.com/uber-and-lyft-take-a-lot-more-from-drivers-than-they-sa-1837450373">more than 14,756</a>&nbsp;real-world trips in response. On average, Jalopnik, found, Uber kept about 35% of the revenue from each ride, and Lyft kept about 38%.  </em></p></blockquote><p>So, if we use that figure of 35% revenue retention from the gross booking, we can work out the level of profitability per trip. </p><p>One other thing to note is that Uber frequently offer incentives for drivers in order to retain a high level of market share. This tactic obviously eats into the short-term profitability with the hope of longer-term market share dominance. For example, on a $10 trip, the passenger might have a $3.50 voucher to use. If this is the case, then the driver would still take 65% of the $10 ($6.50) whilst Uber end up essentially &#8216;writing off&#8217; any potential revenue.</p><p>If the level of incentives exceeds the total value of the trip, then no revenue is captured on the income statement. Any excess incentives are captured as costs of revenue.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf7c4a55-1a90-4750-9637-34ba6e8e0f2f_993x366.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf7c4a55-1a90-4750-9637-34ba6e8e0f2f_993x366.png" width="993" height="366" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cf7c4a55-1a90-4750-9637-34ba6e8e0f2f_993x366.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:366,&quot;width&quot;:993,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:31651,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf7c4a55-1a90-4750-9637-34ba6e8e0f2f_993x366.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf7c4a55-1a90-4750-9637-34ba6e8e0f2f_993x366.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf7c4a55-1a90-4750-9637-34ba6e8e0f2f_993x366.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf7c4a55-1a90-4750-9637-34ba6e8e0f2f_993x366.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The take rate is calculated as the adjusted net revenue divided by the Gross booking value (cost of ride). As we can see from the example above, take rates can vary wildly depending on the level of incentives Uber introduce at any given time.</p><p>The trouble for Uber is the fact that they rely heavily on these driver/user incentives in order to drive useage/loyalty in newer cities. It&#8217;s an essential aspect in the company&#8217;s growth and their ability to create substantial network effects.</p><p>Part of Uber&#8217;s problem here is the fact that users of ride-sharing apps don&#8217;t really tend to have much loyalty or care about which service they are using<strong>.</strong></p><ul><li><p>Only 34% of <strong>customers</strong> use both Uber and Lyft</p></li><li><p>2/3 of <strong>drivers </strong>drive for both apps</p></li><li><p>68% of drivers stop driving within 6 months</p></li><li><p>Churn levels are reported to be as high as 96% after 1 year</p></li></ul><p>So, if Uber suddenly stop with the incentives &amp; offers, they may also end up giving up significant market share. Therefore I raise the question of whether this model is sustainable long-term, especially with potential regulations in top Cities (where the majority of revenue comes from).</p><p>One other thing to add here is earlier in the year, Uber changed their stance on the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/uber-uk-drivers-workers-not-employees/">employment rights</a> of their drivers to be classed as &#8216;workers&#8217;, not employees. This could have significant unit cost implications if the trend were to continue in other large territories.</p><h4>4.4. Uber Eats</h4><p>Uber Eats is a relatively new aspect to the business having been first established in 2014 and is now the fastest growing division within Uber - making up 52% of total revenue for the first half of the year compared to 27% for the same period in 2020. </p><p>The success is mainly due to the fact Uber had the ability to draw upon its existing global network of drivers, leveraging the already available liquidity. This has worked in their favour in many locations where delivery networks were not already established - they had drivers at the ready.</p><p>A quick summary of eats:</p><ul><li><p>Cost savings from using existing uber drivers</p></li><li><p>Couriers get paid a base fare + any tips + incentives/promotions</p></li><li><p>Charges restaurants $350 activation fee + 15% to 30% fee to use the platform</p></li></ul><p>The segment remains unprofitable.</p><h4>4.4.1. Uber Eats Unit Economics</h4><p>Uber Eats generates revenue in 3 main ways: </p><ul><li><p>a delivery fee from each customer</p></li><li><p>a percentage of each driver&#8217;s gross fare</p></li><li><p>and a 30% fee from the restaurant on each order</p></li></ul><p>Similar to its Uber Pool service, Uber also bundles orders together, allowing couriers to deliver multiple orders from restaurants in the same area. The reason for this is to help reduce delivery fees, manifesting in promotions such as $0 delivery fees.</p><p>An Uber Eats order flow is fairly inefficient with many touch-points and several different stages&#8230;</p><h5><strong>Stage 1: Order</strong></h5><ol><li><p>First you open the app and order your desired meal (lets go with a meal that comes to $25).</p></li><li><p>Tax, service, and delivery fees are then applied.</p></li><li><p>Any promotion is then deducted at the end.</p></li></ol><p>From this point, the restaurant receives about 70% of the total booking value. This number can vary, but lets use 70% as an example.</p><p>The remaining 30% goes towards Uber, which is recorded in the income statement as revenues.</p><h5><strong>Stage 2: Delivery</strong></h5><ol><li><p>The restaurant makes your meal.</p></li><li><p>Once ready, a nearby driver will accept the meal.</p></li><li><p>Driver drives to restaurant, waits for the food to be ready.</p></li><li><p>This driver will be paid a base fare + any tips + incentives. <strong>* Note, the driver only gets paid for the time travelling from the restaurant to the final destination. All the waiting time (dead-head time) is unpaid. Not super efficient for the driver*</strong></p></li><li><p>Your order arrives. If you choose to tip, it all goes to the driver.</p></li></ol><p>Here&#8217;s an example of a $25 order and how this flows through to the income statement&#8230;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac970c99-3b64-4aea-aaec-0b67cf4e1887_813x475.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac970c99-3b64-4aea-aaec-0b67cf4e1887_813x475.png" width="813" height="475" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ac970c99-3b64-4aea-aaec-0b67cf4e1887_813x475.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:475,&quot;width&quot;:813,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:34281,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac970c99-3b64-4aea-aaec-0b67cf4e1887_813x475.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac970c99-3b64-4aea-aaec-0b67cf4e1887_813x475.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac970c99-3b64-4aea-aaec-0b67cf4e1887_813x475.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac970c99-3b64-4aea-aaec-0b67cf4e1887_813x475.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Similar to the rides aspect of the business, the unit economics seem fragile.

Uber attempted to purchase Grubhub but failed, leading to JustEat learning from their mistakes and making the purchase in June 2020.</p><p>Uber did end up increasing their position in the market after acquiring Postmates shortly after in September 2020.</p><p>In the US, DoorDash remains the largest competitor in the US with 55% market share, up 5% from 1 year ago. uber takes second place with 22% followed by GrubHub with 17% and Postmates with 5%.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2e9c7d9-bc32-4e67-8640-47f60307cc3b_1437x790.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2e9c7d9-bc32-4e67-8640-47f60307cc3b_1437x790.png" width="1437" height="790" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d2e9c7d9-bc32-4e67-8640-47f60307cc3b_1437x790.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:790,&quot;width&quot;:1437,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:289887,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2e9c7d9-bc32-4e67-8640-47f60307cc3b_1437x790.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2e9c7d9-bc32-4e67-8640-47f60307cc3b_1437x790.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2e9c7d9-bc32-4e67-8640-47f60307cc3b_1437x790.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2e9c7d9-bc32-4e67-8640-47f60307cc3b_1437x790.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>This desire to expand their food delivery network isn&#8217;t new. They recently acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/uber-to-become-the-sole-owner-of-grocery-delivery-startup-cornershop/">Cornership </a>(LatAm, US &amp; Canada).</p><p>The real question lies on the side of unit economics and whether the company can make this business profitable in the long-term. Rising costs for drivers, customers and restaurants raises big question-marks around viability.</p><h4>4.6. Freight</h4><p>Uber entered the market in 2007 offering Uber Freight - a marketplace connecting couriers and truck drivers with shippers. This allowed for up-front and transparent pricing.</p><p>Trucking is a big business, moving roughly 70% of all goods in the united states. However the business has always had problems with inefficiencies and has been slow to digitize over the past decade.</p><blockquote><p><em>It can take several hours, sometimes days, for shippers to find a truck and driver for shipments, with most of the process conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It is equally difficult for carriers to find and book the shipments that work for their businesses, spending hours on the phone negotiating pricing and terms. These inefficiencies adversely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or &#8220;dead-head&#8221; miles, which are miles driven by carriers between shipments.  </em></p></blockquote><p>Today, the Freight sector of the business reports over <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/uber-freight-expands-into-the-enterprise-software-business/">70,000 trucking companies</a> on its network which have access to more than 700,000 truck drivers. Some of its clients include Inbev, Nestle and Heineken. Q2 of 2021 saw Uber Freight bring in its highest ever gross bookings of $348M - a 64% increase Y/Y.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6ec7336-d90a-4b47-b680-0dcc048237d4_983x108.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6ec7336-d90a-4b47-b680-0dcc048237d4_983x108.png" width="983" height="108" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e6ec7336-d90a-4b47-b680-0dcc048237d4_983x108.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:108,&quot;width&quot;:983,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:47820,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6ec7336-d90a-4b47-b680-0dcc048237d4_983x108.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6ec7336-d90a-4b47-b680-0dcc048237d4_983x108.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6ec7336-d90a-4b47-b680-0dcc048237d4_983x108.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6ec7336-d90a-4b47-b680-0dcc048237d4_983x108.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The below video is a good discussion on Uber Freight and logistics.</p><div id="youtube2-lD8u5x7L1dk" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;lD8u5x7L1dk&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lD8u5x7L1dk?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>Again, the company is following a similar playbook for growth as they do in their mobility and deliveries segments - by sacrificing short-term profitability for longer-term growth.</p><blockquote><p>As of october 2020, New York-based private equity firm Greenbriar Equity Group are to invest <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/02/uber-freight-raises-500-million-valuation-rises-to-3point3-billion.html">$500 million</a> in its logistics arm, Uber Freight, valuing the unit at $3.3 billion on a post-money basis  </p></blockquote><h4>4.7. ATG (Advanced Technologies Group)</h4><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;The ATG segment is primarily responsible for the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle and ridesharing technologies.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><p>As of December 2020 Uber reached an agreement with Aurora Innovation, who are backed by Sequoia Capital and Amazon. The deal was reportedly complex, but ended up with Uber handing over its equity in ATG and investing $400M into Aurora - giving Uber a 26% stake in the combined company. Most importantly however, Uber CEO Dada Khosrowshahi will be taking a board seat in Aurora.</p><p>For reference, Aurora, which was founded in 2017, is focused on building the full self-driving stack - the underlying technology that will allow vehicles to navigate highways and city streets without a human driver behind the wheel.  </p><p>The reason this is significant is because now Uber have skin in the game with regards to the race to create world leading AV technology, without being a main competitor for other AV companies like Waymo.</p><p>The big risk is that if another company manages to create the technology first, Uber will be beholden to whoever licences the technology. Realistically, however, the Autonomous Vehicle companies would need to partner with Uber and/or Lyft because they would face the exact same problem Uber currently has - too much demand for their supply. Uber and Lyft will be able to fill in this gap.</p><p>And more to the point, these AV companies will likely follow the money. </p><p>Beyond Uber&#8217;s focus on autonomous driving, the company is also looking into arial ride sharing as an alternate mobility method via the Uber Elevate business. Uber has subsequently done a similar deal with Joby to the ATG deal - giving Uber exposure to the idea but with reduced risk.</p><p>Elevate has already experimented with aerial transportation via Uber Copter, a helicopter service launched last year to fly passengers between lower Manhattan and JFK Airport.</p><h4>4.8. Is AV technology good or bad for Uber?</h4><p>After reading through tonnes of material on Uber and Autonomous Vehicle technology, it seems unclear to me exactly whether it&#8217;s something to look forward to as a shareholder or whether it&#8217;s the beginning of the end. It&#8217;s too early to know.</p><p>One thing we can say for certain is that the companies spending money in this space are throwing <strong>large</strong> amounts of cash at this thing. Because of this fact, it is very likely some company other than Uber beats them to a breakthrough. What would the economics of this particular situation look like for Uber I wonder?</p><p>The argument in favor of Autonomous Vehicle technology integrated into the Uber product offering is fairly straightforward to see from an outside perspective. The ability to have the same output (get a passenger or food item from A to B) but with significantly improved unit economics means Uber could transition from a loss making company to a profit making company essentially overnight.</p><p>However, is this really true? Say we simply eliminated the cost of revenues from the income statement in 2020 (as we no longer pay any drivers), Uber would just about be breaking even.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c2d893f-a670-4536-889b-4a71495410fb_685x336.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c2d893f-a670-4536-889b-4a71495410fb_685x336.png" width="685" height="336" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4c2d893f-a670-4536-889b-4a71495410fb_685x336.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:336,&quot;width&quot;:685,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:31229,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c2d893f-a670-4536-889b-4a71495410fb_685x336.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c2d893f-a670-4536-889b-4a71495410fb_685x336.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c2d893f-a670-4536-889b-4a71495410fb_685x336.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c2d893f-a670-4536-889b-4a71495410fb_685x336.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The real question is this - lets say one of the rivals (Waymo for example) gets there first, what is stopping them from creating their own app loaded with $100m worth of incentives in order to pull Uber users over to the new Waymo-ride app? Especially considering the fact that, as we know, neither drivers or customers within the ride-sharing economy are particularly loyal - they will follow the cheapest/most efficient option.</p><p>Having said that, my counter would be the fact that there is a reason there is a ride-sharing duopoly in the US when creating an app is so simple&#8230; It&#8217;s because acquiring and establishing high engagement rates in a large userbase is super expensive and a non-trivial customer acquisition exercise.</p><p>Therefore, in my opinion, even if the competition get to autonomous vehicle technology first, Uber still has the trump card of a global network of drivers and customers willing and ready to use it - which is invaluable.</p><p>Other reasons AV tech might be bad for Uber include&#8230;</p><ul><li><p>AV will make the barrier to entry lower due to improved unit economics, thereby increasing competition within the industry.</p></li><li><p>The economics of someone else other than Aurora or Uber taking the AV crown may not look so great for Uber.</p></li><li><p>If proprietary AV tech is founded by another company - there is no guarantee it will be licenced to Uber.</p></li><li><p>Could AV tech make other public transport more feasible? Meaning less need for taxi-like transport?</p></li></ul><p>So, to summarize, although the introduction of AV could be seen as good or bad for Uber (depending on how it all plays out) the risk/reward ratio is very high. In addition, and just to be clear - this technology is still a long way off being commercially viable. So will Uber be a profitable company before this shift change? Who knows.</p><h4>4.9. Convergence of assets</h4><p>Uber has some seriously valuable assets under its belt&#8230; two-sided marketplace of drivers and customers, stakes various companies in various industries (Aurora, Joby, Postmates etc..), well known brand, established infrastructure globally and high levles of driver/customer liquidity.</p><p>I have mentioned the point before, but one of the beautiful things about Uber, and something you tend not to see directly on the surface, is the synergistic nature of the various arms of operations.</p><p>We often hear the term super app batted around - but I think in this case it has a chance at materializing. </p><h2>5. Market Opportunity</h2><h4><em>5.1. Mobility Market Opportunity:</em></h4><p>For some strange reason, Uber don&#8217;t mention much about the development of their Total Addressable Market (TAM) or Servicable Addressable Market (SAM) other than in their original S-1 filing and recent investor presentation, so this is pretty much all we have to go on. Assuming Covid has haulted growth in the industry somewhat, I believe the TAM and SAM calculations will still be more-or-less accurate 3 years on&#8230; Just take this data with a pinch of salt.</p><ul><li><p>Defining TAM - &#8220;all passenger vehicle miles and all public transportation miles in all countries globally&#8221;.</p></li><li><p>Defining SAM - &#8220;all miles traveled in passenger vehicles for trips under 30 miles&#8221;</p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faeb94b8f-7a28-4dc7-96af-caff173b254b_1413x416.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faeb94b8f-7a28-4dc7-96af-caff173b254b_1413x416.png" width="535" height="157.50884642604387" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/aeb94b8f-7a28-4dc7-96af-caff173b254b_1413x416.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:416,&quot;width&quot;:1413,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:535,&quot;bytes&quot;:134962,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faeb94b8f-7a28-4dc7-96af-caff173b254b_1413x416.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faeb94b8f-7a28-4dc7-96af-caff173b254b_1413x416.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faeb94b8f-7a28-4dc7-96af-caff173b254b_1413x416.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faeb94b8f-7a28-4dc7-96af-caff173b254b_1413x416.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fccc3f5-a030-4e88-9207-456dcb35f0a7_590x332.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fccc3f5-a030-4e88-9207-456dcb35f0a7_590x332.png" width="590" height="332" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3fccc3f5-a030-4e88-9207-456dcb35f0a7_590x332.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:332,&quot;width&quot;:590,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fccc3f5-a030-4e88-9207-456dcb35f0a7_590x332.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fccc3f5-a030-4e88-9207-456dcb35f0a7_590x332.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fccc3f5-a030-4e88-9207-456dcb35f0a7_590x332.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fccc3f5-a030-4e88-9207-456dcb35f0a7_590x332.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Using the chart above (from the S-1 filing) Uber are telling us it&#8217;s still early days in the ride-sharing business - saying the company has only penetrated less than 1% of both the TAM and SAM (SAM = 3.9Tn Miles, Uber = 26billion miles. Therefore 26Bn/3.9Tn = 0.67% penetration). I can&#8217;t find any updated version of this stat for 2021.</p><p>Realistically, however, I would argue the TAM and SAM are way overstated in order to make the growth opportunity look more attractive than it actually is. I do believe there is significant growth ahead for Uber as they begin to penetrate more and more cities, however Uber and Lyft (and other ride-hailing services) will most likely not be used for most of the journeys under 30 miles.</p><p><em><strong>Why use uber?</strong></em></p><ul><li><p>Highly liquid service. Due to high demand and supply in larger cities (22% of gross bookings in 2020 came from the top 5 cities), it is an extremely efficient service.</p></li><li><p>Quick but relatively expensive solution to public transport.</p></li><li><p>Airports account for over 9% of all trips. Down from 15% in 2018. </p></li></ul><p><em><strong>Demographics?</strong></em></p><ul><li><p>Penetration of awareness has increased significantly to nearly 98% of all Americans.</p></li><li><p>The main demographic is young, well-off people living in large cities where owning a car doesn&#8217;t make much sense. Penetration in these demographics is already high (50%-70%)</p></li></ul><p><em><strong>Is there room to expand?</strong></em></p><p>This is a tricky one. My first reaction would be to lean towards yes due to the constant expansion into new locations. However, competition is rapidly growing meaning companies like Lyft (and Bolt in Europe) are rapidly eating up market share.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F964cbdbb-72bd-40e3-884f-0c6962fbafab_946x683.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F964cbdbb-72bd-40e3-884f-0c6962fbafab_946x683.png" width="531" height="383.3752642706131" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/964cbdbb-72bd-40e3-884f-0c6962fbafab_946x683.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:683,&quot;width&quot;:946,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:531,&quot;bytes&quot;:46947,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F964cbdbb-72bd-40e3-884f-0c6962fbafab_946x683.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F964cbdbb-72bd-40e3-884f-0c6962fbafab_946x683.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F964cbdbb-72bd-40e3-884f-0c6962fbafab_946x683.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F964cbdbb-72bd-40e3-884f-0c6962fbafab_946x683.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The graph above shows 70% of market share. This is correct however still somewhat misleading. According to different sources, market share within the US is somewhere between 65% and 80%, which has come down from 91% in 2015 due to the increase in competition. This number is made up from over 75 million riders and 3.9 million drivers worldwide.</p><ul><li><p>Uber might find it difficult to expand beyond the current user demographics (young people). Once you have children you tend to move outside of cities. Baby seats aren&#8217;t easy to come by in Ubers. Etc.</p></li><li><p>American Automobile Association estimates the cost of owning a car =<strong> $0.75 per mile</strong>, public transport = <strong>$0.27 per mile</strong> whilst Uber = <strong>$1.6 per mile</strong>. Fewer benefits to using an Uber when travelling long distance.</p></li><li><p>Even with AV&#8217;s, people will still own their own cars, therefore not a threat to car ownership.</p></li></ul><p>So, penetration is likely much higher than the 1% mentioned by Uber. TAM and SAM are likely much smaller too. I would lean towards a TAM of roughly $200B with a current penetration (Uber and Lyft) of around 20%-30%.</p><blockquote><p><em>Some tailwinds such as increasing urbanization and delay in obtaining car licenses do exist and may help expand TAM faster than the broader market, but it is hard to see how these mild long-term tailwinds stem the structural headwinds the ridehailing business faces in penetrating the broader market.</em></p></blockquote><p>Uber also mentions additions to their mobility segment which refers to modes of transportation such as dockless&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uber.com/us/en/ride/uber-bike/">e-bikes</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uber.com/us/en/ride/scooters/">e-scooters</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uber.com/us/en/ride/transit/">Transit</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uber.com/us/en/careers/teams/works/">UberWorks</a>&nbsp;etc</p><h4><em>5.2.

This leaves a big question around long-term profitability.</p><h4>5.3. Freight</h4><p>One of Uber&#8217;s newer segments is called Uber Freight.</p><blockquote><p>Uber Freight was launched in the US in May 2017. It is a freight brokerage business connecting shippers and carriers i.e. a marketplace to match these two players. According to Armstrong &amp; Associates, the brokerage business is $72 Bn opportunity, which is ~10% of $700 Bn businesses spent on trucking in the US. Considering 2019 bookings, Uber has ~1% market share.  </p></blockquote><p>I have already talked about this section above. But regarding future potential -  imagine how profitable Freight COULD be if the Aurora bet pays off. They would have an ulimited supply of robo-trucks, virtually 24/7. The unit economics would look great on this.</p><h4><em>5.4. ATG</em></h4><p>Possibly the hardest to put any real estimate on. The trouble is, no-one knows how close/far autonomous vehicles are to being commercially ready - could be 5 to 10+ years off.</p><p>No comment from me on this one.</p><h4>5.5. Summary of market opportunity</h4><p>Overall, I&#8217;m more skeptical on the future addressable market for mobility. I think there are too many unknowns at this point in time surrounding Autonomous Vehicles, who will use them, what the future of public transport looks like. Additionally, it seems Uber are vastly overstating the TAM &amp; SAM in order to insinuate higher future growth than reality (I could easily be wrong on this). Lastly, it&#8217;s super unclear whether the introduction of AV will be a good or bad outcome for Uber - time will tell. </p><p>Regarding the &#8216;Eats&#8217; TAM, I&#8217;m much more confident in the long-term growth potential. The market is undeniably large which is shown by the recent influx of companies going public.</p><p>Lastly, I like the direction Uber is taking with freight and Autonomous Vehicles/ATG. They both might not be huge markets just yet, but if Uber can continue to solidify themselves in these other large verticals, then the eventual convergence to one &#8216;Super App&#8217; could be a very real scenario when the day finally comes.</p><h4>5.6. So what&#8217;s next?</h4><p>Uber&#8217;s expansion into food and grocery delivery will position the company to grow into a &#8220;super app&#8221; revolving around delivery - and it won&#8217;t just be food.</p><p>The staggering level of optionality within the business is one of the most promising aspects and is something that Lyft/Bolt/Doordash/JustEat don&#8217;t have. I strongly believe the route forward is to fully develop each of the upcoming business segments in order to utilize the synergistic nature of their highly liquid two sided marketplaces. The real untapped potential is those vectors converging and compounding.</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/Innovestor_/status/1423595575904251905?s=20&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;However, I'm seeing a good level of optionality (rides, eats, freights, mobility in general, stakes in other ridesharing companies, potential for AV in the future, Uber pass, Uber for business, more high-margin/kg deliveries such as cannabis/alcohol/other high-ticket items??). &quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;Innovestor_&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Innovestor&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Fri Aug 06 10:43:29 +0000 2021&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[{&quot;img_url&quot;:&quot;https://pbs.substack.com/media/E8GgoVeWEAsIYmc.jpg&quot;,&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;https://t.co/5yQcH7HTKb&quot;,&quot;alt_text&quot;:null}],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:0,&quot;like_count&quot;:3,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null}"><a href="https://twitter.com/Innovestor_/status/1423595575904251905?s=20" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-user-avatar" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/twitter_name/w_36/Innovestor_.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @Innovestor_"><span class="tweet-author-name">Innovestor </span><span class="tweet-author">@Innovestor_</span></div>However, I'm seeing a good level of optionality (rides, eats, freights, mobility in general, stakes in other ridesharing companies, potential for AV in the future, Uber pass, Uber for business, more high-margin/kg deliveries such as cannabis/alcohol/other high-ticket items??). <div class="tweet-photos-container"><div class="tweet-photo-wrapper "><img class="tweet-photo" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.substack.com%2Fmedia%2FE8GgoVeWEAsIYmc.jpg" alt="Image"></div></div></a><a href="https://twitter.com/Innovestor_/status/1423595575904251905?s=20" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-footer"><p class="tweet-date">August 6th 2021</p><span class="likes"><span class="like-count">3</span> Likes</span></div></a></div><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Advertising business on Uber Eats is relatively new and high margin (&gt;70% gross)  "Our original goal was to exit this year with $100 million of Ads run-rate revenue, but we now expect to surpass that goal and end 2022 with at least $300 million in run-rate revenues." </em></p></blockquote><p>If we then combine all of the above with Autonomous Vehicles, eVTOL and Transit, you have a holistic door-to-door service which is near impossible for any other company to offer.</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Eventually, you know, I can see a world where if you want to take cash out from the bank, someone will come and deliver cash to you, right?

Competition</h2><h5><strong>Mobility</strong></h5><p>Competition is rife within each of Uber&#8217;s business segments.</p><p>To start with ride-hailing, the main competitor in the US is Lyft who&#8217;s market share had grown to roughly 30% over the past several years. Lyft are, I believe, content in being the number 2 ride-hailing service within the market as Uber have done much of the heavy lifting to create the basis of this two-sided marketplace.</p><p>Bare in mind that drivers will often drive for both companies. <a href="https://secondmeasure.com/datapoints/rideshare-industry-overview/">61% use only Uber while 26% use only Lyft</a>. Uber is also far more prevalent than Lyft outside of the US.</p><h5>Eats</h5><p>Since the pandemic the at-home food delivery market has skyrocketed - with some notable acquisitions in the space. Just Eat purchased GrubHub and Uber (after failing to acquire GrubHub) purchased Postmates.</p><p>DoorDash remains the largest competitor in the US with 55% market share, up 5% from 1 year ago. uber takes second place with 22% followed by GrubHub with 17% and Postmates with 5%.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4643d94a-1d2d-459e-9423-8a80cf81f6bb_668x457.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4643d94a-1d2d-459e-9423-8a80cf81f6bb_668x457.png" width="508" height="347.5389221556886" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4643d94a-1d2d-459e-9423-8a80cf81f6bb_668x457.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:457,&quot;width&quot;:668,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:508,&quot;bytes&quot;:25400,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4643d94a-1d2d-459e-9423-8a80cf81f6bb_668x457.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4643d94a-1d2d-459e-9423-8a80cf81f6bb_668x457.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4643d94a-1d2d-459e-9423-8a80cf81f6bb_668x457.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4643d94a-1d2d-459e-9423-8a80cf81f6bb_668x457.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h5>Freight</h5><p>The most direct competition for Uber within this space is Convoy - a Seattle-based startup. &#8220;Convoy has<a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/400-million-funding-round-values-convoy-at-2-75-billion#:~:text=%24400%20million%20funding%20round%20values%20Convoy%20at%20%242.75%20billion%20%2D%20FreightWaves">&nbsp;raised nearly $668 million</a>&nbsp;in four rounds of funding, according to Crunchbase data.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Other competitors to Uber Freight and Convoy include traditional brokers such as publicly-traded giant&nbsp;<a href="https://www.chrobinson.com/">C.H.

Management?</h2><p>Uber has had an interesting history with CEO&#8217;s. The original CEO Travis Kalanick garnered a poor reputation from the media for several fairly damning indiscretions. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40352868">Here&#8217;s a link if you want to read more about it.</a> </p><p>Having said that, I believe Travis was crucial in building what is now one of the worlds most influential tech companies. We have to remember Uber were not first to the ride-sharing market - this was Lyft. The only difference between the two were the CEO&#8217;s. Travis&#8217;s particular skill set (aggressive, scrappy entrepreneur) was likely the major contributing factor in Uber&#8217;s success.</p><p>All this being said, as Uber evolved over the years, the company culture and management needed to evolve too in order to reflect the improved direction. This lead to Travis&#8217;s replacement in 2017 - Dara Khosrowshahi, the previous CEO of Expedia.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea818003-abb9-4b71-ad5f-c208a171d03c_638x375.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea818003-abb9-4b71-ad5f-c208a171d03c_638x375.png" width="522" height="306.8181818181818" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ea818003-abb9-4b71-ad5f-c208a171d03c_638x375.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:375,&quot;width&quot;:638,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:522,&quot;bytes&quot;:314096,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea818003-abb9-4b71-ad5f-c208a171d03c_638x375.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea818003-abb9-4b71-ad5f-c208a171d03c_638x375.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea818003-abb9-4b71-ad5f-c208a171d03c_638x375.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea818003-abb9-4b71-ad5f-c208a171d03c_638x375.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h4><strong>CEO: Dara Khosrowshahi (2017-present)</strong></h4><p>Dara Khosrowshahi offers a completely different leadership style to that of Travis.

These systems manage the world&#8217;s largest e-commerce catalog of products and offers, serving up information on billions of products at more than 10M requests/second.</p><p>Before Amazon, Sukumar spent many years in software engineering and architecture leadership roles at Microsoft, PeopleSoft, and Oracle.</p><h2>8.

Uber&#8217;s core business is very much in question which really narrows its capacity to capitalize on its optionality.&#8221;</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Valuable asset base</strong> if the company can sort themselves out.</p></li><li><p><strong>Large set of proprietary data</strong>. Will become very valuable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Aggregator for all transportation</strong> - essentially door-to-door as a service. Having a two-sided network large enough to meet demand/supply needs globally is an incredibly tall order. This advantage, in and of itself, can be a successful Moat. Haulage company&#8217;s are a good practical example. U-Haul aren&#8217;t the cheapest option &#8211; but the availability in every city around the country has enabled them to dominate. </p><p>For mobility, Uber has the largest global/U.S. supply and demand network. Riders expect a ride whenever and wherever they are - that requires great supply density. That means many millions of cars ready close by to anywhere the demand may be.</p></li><li><p>Uber is potentially an "<strong>AV agnostic</strong>" platform which other robo-taxi services will onboard onto in order to gain sufficient demand. Good plan B in the stake in Aurora.</p><p>Uber is the only provider who will be able to offer a holistic AV taxi + eVTOL + transit + eScooter service, meaning they will be the only ones to offer a seamless door-to-door solution.</p></li><li><p>Skin in the game in each of the above veritcals&#8230; Transit = Uber Freight, AV = Aurora, eVTOL = Joby, micro-mobility = Lime.</p></li><li><p>Offering an incredibly efficient service (most of the time).</p></li></ol><h2>9. Bear</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Regulations </strong>- There has already been many examples of this. </p><p>The most high profile example being Prop 22 in California <em>&#8220;Uber and Lyft got their way in California with voters supporting their Proposition 22 ballot measure.&nbsp;Prop 22 exempts Uber, Lyft&nbsp;and other app-based transportation and delivery companies from classifying their workers as employees, and lets them keep treating them like independent contractors.&#8221;</em></p><p>Big cities are another example of where regulation could easily occurr - majorly effecting Uber&#8217;s bottom line. &#8220;<em>In 2020, we derived 22% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas&#8212;Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City in the United States, Sao Paulo in Brazil, and London in the United Kingdom.&#8221; </em>It&#8217;s not hard to see how the desire for reduced traffic or pollution could result in a crackdown on Uber vehicles in these big cities.</p><p>Another example is potential regulation in one of Uber&#8217;s top usecases - airport pickups/dropoffs. Parking makes up large rev % at airports, therefore the airports might be incentivised to lobby for regulations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Competition </strong>- Strong competition in all areas. E.g. Lyft in rides.</p></li><li><p><strong>Loyalty of Drivers/customers</strong> - It&#8217;s common for drivers to drive for both companies. 61% use only Uber, while 26% use only Lyft.</p></li><li><p><strong>AV could prove to be the big risk</strong>. It&#8217;s not clear at all how this will play out in the long-term. It could equally be the best or worst thing to happen to Uber.</p></li><li><p><strong>Uber product is still very expensive</strong>. Car = $0.75 per mile, Uber = $1.6 per mile globally and $2 per mile in the US.</p></li><li><p><strong>Concerning Unit Economics</strong> on each business segment.</p></li><li><p>Overall <strong>revenue growth has been slowing</strong> in the recent years - likely to pick back up coming out of Covid.</p></li><li><p>How long can they keep <strong>burning through cash</strong> is a very real issue.</p></li></ol><h2>10. Financials</h2><h4>10.1. Funding</h4><p>Uber are well known for the large sums of VC money they have been burning through over the past decade without making any profits. Here are some top level statistics regarding their funding.</p><blockquote><p><em>Dated Feb 2021:</em></p><p><em>According to reporting from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/uber/company_financials">Crunchbase</a>, &#8220;Uber has raised a total of $24.7B in funding over 26 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on Apr 26, 2019 from a Post-IPO Equity round.&#8221; </em></p><p><em>Uber has 107 investors, including PayPal and Toyota Motor Corp.</em></p><p><em>From August 2015 to January 2020, a grand total of $18.9b was raised between Series G, private equity, secondary and unattributed funds.</em></p></blockquote><p>There is always going to be an overarching question of whether Uber will ever be able to rectify their cash burning situation. They have roughly $5 billion in cash on the balance sheet along with roughly $15 billion in equity stakes. </p><p>I believe Uber have the scale and resources to keep this strategy up for a long, long time.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9fc809b-cf2f-4d9c-8ccf-550f767fce54_1450x807.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9fc809b-cf2f-4d9c-8ccf-550f767fce54_1450x807.jpeg" width="1450" height="807" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f9fc809b-cf2f-4d9c-8ccf-550f767fce54_1450x807.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:807,&quot;width&quot;:1450,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:129074,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9fc809b-cf2f-4d9c-8ccf-550f767fce54_1450x807.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9fc809b-cf2f-4d9c-8ccf-550f767fce54_1450x807.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9fc809b-cf2f-4d9c-8ccf-550f767fce54_1450x807.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9fc809b-cf2f-4d9c-8ccf-550f767fce54_1450x807.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>  </p><h4>10.2.

Operating leverage</h4><p>As alluded to earlier, Uber&#8217;s cost structure is unique in that they have very few fixed costs to worry about - they don&#8217;t own the cars or bikes drivers use to make trips. This means improving the cost structure might be tricky due to the majority of their costs being variable. Lets look at how they can improve these costs.</p><blockquote><p><em>Cost of revenue primarily consists of certain insurance costs related to our Mobility and Delivery offerings, credit card processing fees, bank fees, data center and networking expenses  </em></p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff211ed02-3ea1-43ca-842f-4f54355d5f46_980x224.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff211ed02-3ea1-43ca-842f-4f54355d5f46_980x224.png" width="980" height="224" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f211ed02-3ea1-43ca-842f-4f54355d5f46_980x224.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:224,&quot;width&quot;:980,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:96556,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff211ed02-3ea1-43ca-842f-4f54355d5f46_980x224.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff211ed02-3ea1-43ca-842f-4f54355d5f46_980x224.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff211ed02-3ea1-43ca-842f-4f54355d5f46_980x224.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff211ed02-3ea1-43ca-842f-4f54355d5f46_980x224.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>So what can Uber change here? </p><ul><li><p>Insurance costs - This is a complex aspect, and not something I&#8217;m super knowledgeable about. However, knowing Uber primarily buys insurance from third parties, they could look to bring this aspect more in-house. That being said, I think it would be best to leave the insurance companies to do what they do best.</p></li><li><p>Driver incentives - These incentives are crucial for eating up market share and remaining competitive over the short-to-medium term. Realistically, we can expect a taper-off over the long-term as Uber capture the wider ridesharing and delivery market.</p></li><li><p>Payment processing - is currently roughly 20% of the total cost of revenues and around 2% of total gross bookings. I believe this is likely to stay proportional as scale continues, therefore no massive opportunities to reduce costs here.</p></li><li><p>Operations and support - This mainly consists of <em>&#8220;compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation, for employees that support operations in cities, including the general managers, Driver operations, platform user support representatives and community managers. Also included is the cost of customer support, Driver background checks and the allocation of certain corporate costs.&#8221;</em>  </p><p>One aspect that jumps out as a potential improvement in operating leverage is the driver background checks. If Uber can reduce the current high-level of driver churn in the system, we could see some non-trivial savings. For reference, <a href="https://www.uberpeople.net/threads/is-the-idea-of-endless-driver-supply-a-myth.442160/">a study from 2015/16</a> showed 68% of drivers stopped driving within 6 months. This may have improved recently, but I couldn&#8217;t find any evidence. The reason for this high level of churn is likely due to the nature of the business - oftentimes drivers use uber as an inbetween job with no real intention of it being a long-term career.</p></li><li><p>Sales and Marketing - Mainly consists of <em>&#8220;compensation costs, including stock-based compensation to sales and marketing employees, advertising costs, product marketing costs and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers, and the allocation of certain corporate costs.&#8221;</em></p><p>This cost represented roughly 31% of total revenue in 2020 and has a run-rate percentage of 35% in 2021. Realistically, instead of rising I would be looking to see this number come down to ~20% of revenue in order for the company to be looking at strong profitability.</p><p>Having said this, I&#8217;m not sure how easy it will be for Uber to lower this cost if promotions and incentives become an integral part of the business. I.e. what happens if they stop offering the incentives to improve short term profitability?</p></li><li><p>R&amp;D - Mainly consists of <em>&#8220;compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees in engineering, design and product development.&#8221; </em>It used to include a significant portion devoted to R&amp;D on the ATG programme, however since the deal late last year, this expense item has decreased dramatically - <strong>from ~24% of Revenue to ~15% of revenue.</strong></p><p>You might argue if Uber want to be competitive in the AV space then a higher allocation here would be prudent, however I believe they have structured the deal with Aurora in a way that allows for both a reduction in R&amp;D whilst remaining competitive.</p></li></ul><h4>10.4. Income statement</h4><p>Lets first look at Uber&#8217;s finances from a distance, then I will delve deeper into individual aspects I find interesting.</p><p>Firstly, if we do some general trend analysis of Uber over the past few years, the picture doesn&#8217;t look too rosy.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91ef0a22-6f24-446a-88e0-4e60ef99ec16_1196x575.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91ef0a22-6f24-446a-88e0-4e60ef99ec16_1196x575.png" width="1196" height="575" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/91ef0a22-6f24-446a-88e0-4e60ef99ec16_1196x575.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:575,&quot;width&quot;:1196,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:167963,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91ef0a22-6f24-446a-88e0-4e60ef99ec16_1196x575.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91ef0a22-6f24-446a-88e0-4e60ef99ec16_1196x575.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91ef0a22-6f24-446a-88e0-4e60ef99ec16_1196x575.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91ef0a22-6f24-446a-88e0-4e60ef99ec16_1196x575.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>We can see revenue is generally increasing over the years as the company continues to grow and expand into new markets/territories. Then looking down just one line we can see the gross margin figure (cost of revenue) equates to roughly 50% of sales in most years. Not too bad so far.</p><p>Below the cost of revenues are the other costs necessary to run the business. In this case, after these extra costs are applied, we&#8217;re looking at a net loss of between 30% and 60%. If we then consider the recent change in classification of Uber drivers in the UK to workers (not quite employees), we have to ask the question will this increase costs over time as the administrative burden of on-boarding these workers increases? </p><h4>10.5.

This is mainly due to the additional paid in capital number, some of which derives from the redeemable convertible preferred stock figure, but the remainder is the result of a significant injection of cash from investors. Therefore, the cash has been increasing over the years.</p><p>In addition, the company&#8217;s total assets easily cover the current &amp; total liabilities which is a healthy position to be in long-term.

From the image above we can see Uber burn a frankly ridiculous amount of cash - as high as 4.2B in 2019. It doesn&#8217;t take much to get slightly worried that if Uber continue this pattern of burning cash over a long period of time, investors might end up pulling out.</p><p>Ideally, over the next 3-5 years I would expect to see this figure turn positive as some of these markets start to mature and Uber figure out a way to be profitable.</p><p>Historically, as we can see, the main source of cash for the business has been through financing activities which, in the long run, could be unsustainable.</p><p>Most notable, however, is the recent rise in cash flows from investing activities which has popped up into the positives at $101M.

Valuation</h4><p>In order to come up with a suitable valuation for Uber, I decided to base my calculations on my classical EBITDA figure in the profitability section above (6.7%). The reason being is that this is their long-term target for profitability. 10 years seems like a good amount of time to achieve this.</p><p><em><strong>*These calculations involve many assumptions which you might disagree with. Feel free to play around with the numbers*</strong></em></p><p>Firstly, based on the past revenue growth (2017 to 2021 run rate) we end up with an average revenue growth of 18%. For simplicity, I decided to round this figure up to 20% moving forwards.</p><p>Secondly (left table) I forecast revenue over the next 10 years, to 2031 using this flat growth rate of 20%. This ends up being $117B. Once we have this revenue figure, we can then work out the estimated EBITDA from our calculations earlier (6.7%) to give us an EBITDA in 2031 of $7.8B.</p><p>After this, we have enough information to come to an estimated stock price.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F209bba93-af8a-413e-a2d0-ed77f8fd9c5b_698x470.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F209bba93-af8a-413e-a2d0-ed77f8fd9c5b_698x470.png" width="698" height="470" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/209bba93-af8a-413e-a2d0-ed77f8fd9c5b_698x470.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:470,&quot;width&quot;:698,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:100346,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F209bba93-af8a-413e-a2d0-ed77f8fd9c5b_698x470.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F209bba93-af8a-413e-a2d0-ed77f8fd9c5b_698x470.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F209bba93-af8a-413e-a2d0-ed77f8fd9c5b_698x470.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F209bba93-af8a-413e-a2d0-ed77f8fd9c5b_698x470.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>A few more assumptions have to be made.

Conclusion</h2><p>This is possibly one of the toughest conclusions I have had to write. On one hand, I&#8217;m looking at a company that, on paper, is hemorrhaging money. There is literally no evidence they are capable of posting a profit. And even when they do, it&#8217;s a manufactured (very dubious) &#8216;Adjusted EBITDA&#8217; figure. The risk/reward ratio is not the best in this case.</p><p>On the other hand, I&#8217;m an optimist. I see a company who have changed the world, and in doing so have put themselves in prime position to capitalize on multiple growing market. Not only that, but the convergence of these markets could easily be a case where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.</p><p>With relatively new management looking to change the direction of the company and several positive recent quarters, Uber is beginning to catch my eye.</p><p>Long-term (and I mean at least 5-10 years minimum) Uber could be the most dominant delivery/transport technology company in the world - or not. I&#8217;ll leave that for you to decide.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Innovestor </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Skin in the game]]></title><description><![CDATA[Stock take #2]]></description><link>https://innovestor.substack.com/p/skin-in-the-game</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://innovestor.substack.com/p/skin-in-the-game</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Innovestor]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 16:24:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feaf92da3-5d2b-422e-b7af-e70fbdfac4d7_1600x900.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Today is a different style of article than the usual Innovestor deep-dive.

Chances are you will find yourself way more invested in the horse or team for which winning benefits your bank balance.</p><p>In sports, many people use betting to make the game more enjoyable due to the higher personal stakes involved. Therefore if we apply the same principle to investing, we can use it to our advantage by playing on our innate human biases.</p><p>The feeling of wanting your team/horse to win when betting is a very similar feeling to when you invest in a stock. You will do everything in your power to help your team to win (shouting at the TV). Similarly when investing a small amount in a stock, your immediate impulse is the desire for that stock to increase in value as much as possible. The result of which is an increased desire to delve deep into the company accounts - finding any source of information which could give you an edge over other investors.</p><p>In reality, it&#8217;s not always a good idea to start a small position in a company for the sole reason of making you more personally invested in the company. But if it&#8217;s a company for which you have carried out a good portion of your DD, it&#8217;s often a good idea to initiate a small position to see if you feel comfortable with the decision/volatility.</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;What matters isn&#8217;t what a person has or doesn&#8217;t have; it is what he or she is afraid of losing.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><p>The above quote comes from a book I recently finished called &#8216;Skin in the Game&#8217; by Nassim Taleb. An interesting book filled with thought-provoking examples. I found myself disagreeing with about as many ideas as I agreed with. Take of that what you will. A thought-provoking nonetheless. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabc77790-1389-4429-bbab-ece5ea5fdb42_1662x2560.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabc77790-1389-4429-bbab-ece5ea5fdb42_1662x2560.jpeg" width="266" height="409.77884615384613" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/abc77790-1389-4429-bbab-ece5ea5fdb42_1662x2560.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:2243,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:266,&quot;bytes&quot;:242827,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabc77790-1389-4429-bbab-ece5ea5fdb42_1662x2560.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabc77790-1389-4429-bbab-ece5ea5fdb42_1662x2560.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabc77790-1389-4429-bbab-ece5ea5fdb42_1662x2560.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabc77790-1389-4429-bbab-ece5ea5fdb42_1662x2560.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The underlying message in this book is about the asymmetry of information and how having skin in the game is the desired option for most scenarios.</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;The curse of modernity is that we are increasingly populated by a class of people who are better at explaining than understanding, or better at explaining than doing.&#8221; </em></p></blockquote><h3>How can I make sure I apply &#8216;skin in the game&#8217; to my investing process?</h3><p>When we look at &#8216;skin in the game&#8217; with regards to the companies we choose to invest in, we are basically asking the question&#8230; &#8220;does company X have the correct incentives in place in order to enable the best chance of future success?&#8221;</p><p>I have three main ways of distinguishing companies with skin in the game from those without. There are nuances with each of the below, however they serve as a good rule of thumb.</p><h5>1. Insider ownership</h5><p>One of the best &#8216;tells&#8217; as to the incentives of a company&#8217;s management team is the level of stock ownership present. For example, the CEO at company A might own 20% of the company&#8217;s shares, whilst CEO of company B only owns 0.5% of Company B&#8217;s shares. </p><p>Which do you think has the better incentives to ensure the future success of the company?</p><h5>2. Founder led</h5><p>Founders being involved in the company when looking to invest (even in a small capacity) is usually a big positive. The reason being is that it represents one of the main principles of skin in the game - that the long-term vision for the company is directed by someone who (at their core) cares about the success of the business. And not just success in terms of making money, but more-so &#8216;legacy&#8217; for the founder.</p><p>A good example of this is Amazon. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, built the company up from scratch in order to be the behemoth it is today. That being said, just because the original founder is no longer involved in the project, it does not mean the company cannot thrive. </p><p>Take the below chart as an example, showing Microsoft&#8217;s success over the past several years since the on-boarding of a new CEO.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b6ecd1f-9d9e-4688-bdaa-68c041498270_1280x788.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b6ecd1f-9d9e-4688-bdaa-68c041498270_1280x788.png" width="1280" height="788" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3b6ecd1f-9d9e-4688-bdaa-68c041498270_1280x788.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:788,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:319147,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b6ecd1f-9d9e-4688-bdaa-68c041498270_1280x788.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b6ecd1f-9d9e-4688-bdaa-68c041498270_1280x788.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b6ecd1f-9d9e-4688-bdaa-68c041498270_1280x788.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b6ecd1f-9d9e-4688-bdaa-68c041498270_1280x788.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>We can clearly see that Steve Ballmer didn&#8217;t have the best spell as CEO of Microsoft.

You can show off to your friends like &#8216;I've worked in bananas, I've worked in peaches, I've worked in grapes&#8230;&#8217; etc. but you never really taste it.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.buymeacoffee.com/innovestor&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Buy me a coffee!&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/innovestor"><span>Buy me a coffee!</span></a></p><h4>Final thoughts</h4><p>Skin in the game is, if nothing else, a useful rule of thumb which should be considered in your investment decisions, along with life in general.

Thesis</h2><p>Enthusiast Gaming is an opportunity to capitalize on a combination of a rapidly growing market (esports/gaming) with a &#8216;direction agnostic&#8217; position within that market. I.e. not reliant on taking a bet on any particular game/trend/franchise to play out (e.g. Roblox/Fortnite/CoD). </p><p>The thesis here is to bet on the gaming industry in general, and the immense untapped value that a highly engaged group of 300M GenZ&#8217;s and Millenials will have in the near future. As advertisers and marketing managers come to recognise the potential for community, the average revenue per user will grow substantially (prediction of $3 but possibly way higher).</p><p>Along with this, gaming is the next social hangout space for young people, and 70% of GenZ&#8217;s attribute gaming as a large expression of their personality.</p><p>Gaming will continue to evolve rapidly over the coming years - EGLX are in the best position to monetise the community of gamers around the globe.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2961ad2b-9394-4cc4-90c5-ab1041bd71b2_685x375.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2961ad2b-9394-4cc4-90c5-ab1041bd71b2_685x375.png" width="469" height="256.75182481751824" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2961ad2b-9394-4cc4-90c5-ab1041bd71b2_685x375.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:375,&quot;width&quot;:685,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:469,&quot;bytes&quot;:136622,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2961ad2b-9394-4cc4-90c5-ab1041bd71b2_685x375.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2961ad2b-9394-4cc4-90c5-ab1041bd71b2_685x375.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2961ad2b-9394-4cc4-90c5-ab1041bd71b2_685x375.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2961ad2b-9394-4cc4-90c5-ab1041bd71b2_685x375.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h2>2.

Business Model Overview</h2><p>Enthusiast gaming is a business model that, on the surface, isn&#8217;t the most straightforward. They are neither a games developer, distributor, or anything directly related to the titles themselves. Those roles within the industry are competed by companies like Activision (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA), Roblox (RBLX), Unity (U) and Take-Two (TTWO) amongst others, who are all extremely good at what they do. </p><p>Enthusiast Gaming&#8217;s area of competence is around the community. They have spent time and money building a community of engaged gamers with the option to tap into directly at any time. I&#8217;ll go onto explain why this is valuable later on in the article, however for the time being here&#8217;s their mission statement.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Mission</strong> &#8211; &#8220;building a world of communities where video gamers connect and engage&#8221;.</em></p></blockquote><p>In essence, Enthusiast Gaming is building the world&#8217;s largest platform of communities for gamers and eSports fans. The company owns a platform with <strong>over 100 websites over 20M youtube subscribers, 7 pro E-Sports teams, over 550 influencers, subscription sites, events and more</strong>. Part of this includes the ownership of Luminosity Gaming,&nbsp; which is one of the bigger E-Sports organizations in the world. Also, they have close to 30 events (b2b &amp; b2c) around the world &#8211; including the largest mobile gaming event in Europe and the largest gaming expo in Canada.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F683a0c9c-6388-4a98-a96e-86d848314e1f_826x782.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F683a0c9c-6388-4a98-a96e-86d848314e1f_826x782.png" width="464" height="439.28329297820824" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/683a0c9c-6388-4a98-a96e-86d848314e1f_826x782.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:782,&quot;width&quot;:826,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:464,&quot;bytes&quot;:119932,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F683a0c9c-6388-4a98-a96e-86d848314e1f_826x782.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F683a0c9c-6388-4a98-a96e-86d848314e1f_826x782.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F683a0c9c-6388-4a98-a96e-86d848314e1f_826x782.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F683a0c9c-6388-4a98-a96e-86d848314e1f_826x782.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The sheer size of the user-base of <strong>300M monthly active users worldwide</strong> is arguably the company&#8217;s most compelling competitive advantage. This alone gives them the ability to communicate with over 300M game enthusiasts each and every month, which makes EGLX the largest gaming network in both North America and the UK.</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;We feel no-one is as obsessively focused on the fan experience as we are. The thing that makes us so different to anyone else in the space is that we are not trying to dominate a vertical; we are not trying to just be an eSports organization, a collection of websites, or a tournament organizer - we want to build value right across the fan experience. If you are a super-keen EPIC Games&#8217; Fortnite player who has logged-off, the beauty of this gaming phenomenon is that you are not then &#8216;done&#8217; &#8211; you go to Twitch where &#8211; obviously! - we want you watching our Fortnite streamers Muselk and Fresh, when you go to YouTube, we want you to go to the biggest Fortnite YouTube channel in the world &#8211; our channel, BCC Gaming, if you want to see what EPIC Gaming is up to next, we want you to then come to one of our events and see their booth up-close. It is all highly integrated &#8211; and hopefully a lot of fun also!&#8221;  - <strong><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/drgeraintevans/2020/12/07/building-a-leading-esports-organization-an-exclusive-interview-with-adrian-montgomery-ceo-of-enthusiast-gaming/">Adrian Montgomery (CEO)</a></strong></em></p></blockquote><h4>3.1. So, how do they make money?</h4><p>As with many business models, the answer is <strong>advertising.</strong></p><p>Enthusiast Gaming don&#8217;t own any large games like CoD or streaming platforms like twitch. However, they do have a base of over 300M engaged monthly active users with which they can present adverts to. Combine this with the possibility for influencer marketing and you have a powerful route directly to these lucrative age groups.</p><p>Companies like Facebook and Google are already dominating the advertising space with their ad platforms, however advertising is evolving. Influencer marketing is becoming one of the most effective forms of advertisements - and Enthusiast are in a great position to capitalise.</p><p>The level of content and reach within the gaming industry gives Enthusiast Gaming the opportunity to <a href="https://www.enthusiastgaming.com/enthusiast-gaming-signs-multi-platform-sponsorship-deal-with-samsung/">partner with large companies like Samsung</a> who will be able to more effectively target ads.</p><h4>3.2. Understanding the model</h4><p>The idea of gaming is a different experience for different people&#8230; Some might complete the story-mode, maybe play online - but then once you turn it off, you forget about it. The other type of gamer would be playing in a similar way, with the big difference being the involvement and consumption of content around the game. For example, youtube videos, forums, podcasts, attending events etc.</p><p>In order to understand the business model, lets try to put ourselves in the shoes of a typical gamer. I&#8217;ll use myself as an example. Once I&#8217;m done playing I might&#8230;</p><ul><li><p>Try to find news about future games/updates to games that are coming up.</p></li><li><p>Join a forum to discuss the game with other fans.</p></li><li><p>Subscribe to a youtube channel to watch live-streams or to find tips/tricks/engage in comments.</p></li><li><p>Look at twitch or youtube to follow a particular e-sports team</p></li><li><p>Attend virtual event (previously live events) &#8211; and connect with other fans at these events.</p></li></ul><p>The fact Enthusiast Gaming has curated an eco-system creates a flywheel effect where the more people involved in every aspect of the ecosystem (websites, YouTube channels, e-sports team, influencers, experiences), the more value is created for users &#8211; therefore attracting more users and fueling the flywheel. This eco-system around the game itself the the portion of the gaming experience EGLX are aiming to control.</p><h4>3.3. The core pillars of Enthusiast</h4><p>If we zoom out slightly to try and distinguish some core pillars of the business model, it breaks down into three main sections - Media, Events and E-Sports.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ebd26b0-8387-42dd-bedd-60fb8ef24161_1232x649.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ebd26b0-8387-42dd-bedd-60fb8ef24161_1232x649.png" width="676" height="356.10714285714283" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6ebd26b0-8387-42dd-bedd-60fb8ef24161_1232x649.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:649,&quot;width&quot;:1232,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:676,&quot;bytes&quot;:548171,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ebd26b0-8387-42dd-bedd-60fb8ef24161_1232x649.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ebd26b0-8387-42dd-bedd-60fb8ef24161_1232x649.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ebd26b0-8387-42dd-bedd-60fb8ef24161_1232x649.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ebd26b0-8387-42dd-bedd-60fb8ef24161_1232x649.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h5><strong>3.3.1. Media (95% of rev for most recent quarter)</strong></h5><p>The media aspect, which makes up roughly 95% of the most recent revenue stream, is a crucial part of Enthusiast Gaming&#8217;s business. As shown in the image above, this consists of over 100 active sites, over 1000 youtube channels with over 3.2B views every month and a bunch of high-profile influencers within the industry.</p><p>The company sees their assets (luminosity gaming, influencers etc.) as &#8220;content factories&#8221; - keeping fans engaged.</p><p>The crucial point here is the fact that EGLX owns this entire audience.

Lots of room to improve here.</p></li><li><p>E-sports makes up 6.5% of total revenue.</p></li></ul><h4>3.4 Revenue streams</h4><p>The CEO, Adrian Montgomery recently said in an interview when asked about the strategy behind revenue generation at EGLX - <em>&#8220;We aggregate the largest fanbase possible, and turn that fanbase into a customer base.&#8221;</em></p><p>Simple.</p><p>Now if we delve slightly deeper into this statement, we can begin to see why this strategy (within the context of the gaming industry) will be so lucrative in the future.</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;They&#8221; </em>(Gen Z &amp; Millenials)<em> &#8220;are the world&#8217;s most lucrative demographic because they have&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;of purchasing power. They don&#8217;t have their money sucked away by these things called children and mortgages. If you are a company, you are no doubt trying to get them into your world at a very early point in their buying lifecycle. What people don&#8217;t really understand is that any traditional sports would kill for the demographics of an eSports fan - they are a little bit older than you think &#8211; typically being in their 20&#8217;s; they have more disposable income than other traditional sports fan but then, they are elusive - they just don&#8217;t consume content the way I did in 20 years ago!&#8221;  <strong>Adrian Montgomery - CEO</strong></em></p></blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;Gen Z are the most lucrative demographic, but also the most elusive.&#8221;</strong> Some statistics to illustrate this point&#8230;</p><ul><li><p>Almost none watch linear TV.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.ypulse.com/article/2021/04/07/3-stats-on-social-media-taking-over-gen-zs-entertainment-consumption/">Gen Z spend almost 4.5 hours a day on social media</a>, while Millennials estimate they spend an average of around 3.8 hours.   </p></li><li><p><strong>Gen Z are more likely to have watched social media videos in the last week than TV series. </strong>70% of Gen Zs say they consume social media videos. That&#8217;s an increase from 66% who reported watching social media videos in the last week back in June 2020. This means that for this group, social media video viewing now eclipses TV series viewing, with 66% reporting that they watched TV series in the last week.  </p></li><li><p><strong>Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat are in their top 10 sources for video content - but cable isn&#8217;t. </strong>Just 15% report watching cable weekly or more.  </p></li><li><p><strong>The majority are using social media while they&#8217;re watching TV. </strong>Over half (57%) of Gen Z use social media while they&#8217;re watching TV. The fragmented attention is real. That&#8217;s compared to 51% of Millennials who say the same, so in case you were wondering if older consumers were more engaged viewers, they are but barely.  </p></li><li><p><strong>Gen Z makes more mobile purchases</strong>. Compared to millennials, Gen Z is&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/millennials-vs-gen-z">twice as likely</a>&nbsp;to purchase something on their mobile device.</p></li></ul><p>Taking all this into account, <strong>Gen Z are fickle, hard to reach, elusive, but also a goldmine for advertisers. </strong>Being able to communicate through gaming is the key to unlock this demographic. Therefore creating an incredible opportunity to monetize through ad-sense, and you can command significant advertising rates because of this. It&#8217;s all made possible due to the fact that the platform is wholly owned by EGLX.</p><p>So, if we then look at how this breaks down in reality - there are 4 main methods of generating revenue, and more to come. </p><ol><li><p><strong>Ad sales:</strong> Strong base to sell ads and to monetize. Viewers come back 25ish times per month &#8211; compared to IGN/Gamestop = 5/6 times per month. Twich = 5/6 times per month. </p></li><li><p><strong>Subscription:</strong> Opportunity to sell subscriptions to a percentage of these 300M base. E.g. sims resource subscription service &#8211; 137,000 people pay $4 per month for VIP content. Recurring high margin rev stream.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sponsorship of E-Sports teams: </strong>All the big brands want to get into gaming at the moment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Appreciation in value of e-sports teams: </strong>One way trend for all sports.</p><p><strong>*Future </strong>- marketplace/platform for gamers.*</p></li></ol><p>The beauty with this business model is the fact it&#8217;s agnostic to specific games or directions of travel within the industry. It&#8217;s not like Activision who&#8217;s future performance directly relates to the success of their handful of franchises. If gaming wins - EGLX wins. Therefore it&#8217;s great overall exposure to the e-sports sector.</p><p>There are no other companies/products with this array of assets. The aim is to own all communities, and have as many touchpoints as possible with GenZs.</p><h2>4.

However, Adrian was clear that other brands need to realize that gaming is not a hobby for many millions &#8211; billions of people.</em></p><p><em>&#8220;eSports is more than a hobby for gamers - it&#8217;s a way of life. It&#8217;s their identity, it&#8217;s their social network, and it&#8217;s their method of expression. eSports and gaming is going to continue to skyrocket, and people are realizing how pervasive it is in people&#8217;s lives. What I&#8217;ve seen change this year - and I can tell you which is one of the most exciting things for our industry today - is that most marketing directors now know if you need to communicate with young people, you simply must have a video game strategy. eSports has made quantum leaps during the recent pandemic.&#8221; - </em><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/drgeraintevans/2020/12/07/building-a-leading-esports-organization-an-exclusive-interview-with-adrian-montgomery-ceo-of-enthusiast-gaming/">Excerpt from interview with Adrian Montgomery.</a></p></blockquote><p>The industry as a whole is estimated to be growing at roughly 35% per year. This presents massive opportunity for brands looking to get in early and cement themselves within the community.</p><p>Take Red Bull for example. With an early vision of esports marketing, the company is now synonymous with various top players - Ninja for example.</p><h4>5.2. ARPU</h4><p>Relating directly to advertising, ARPU (average Revenue Per User) is the low hanging fruit the company can currently focus on in order to really grow top-line revenue in the short-term. ARPU currently currently sits at $0.4 but with some minor changes of emphasis, it is predicted to jump to $3 by 2023 - however I can see it going much higher.</p><p>ARPU is higher in the US than anywhere else because the sheer value of the Youtube and Web eyeballs in America is significantly higher than anywhere else.</p><h4><strong>5.3. Advertising/Sales team</strong></h4><p>Another aspect of the growth and increasing ARPU is the increase in the sales team to better penetrate the direct advertising market. </p><p>They have the potential to quickly unlock some of the ARPU through direct ads. These direct ads are more likely to be exclusive/targeted and much better value for the brand/advertiser as EGLX know exactly their target audience (70% Gen Z &amp; Millenials). These brand partners are willing to pay a premium for this added precision with the advertising model.</p><p>The brands want access to Enthusiast&#8217;s youtube audience, web audience, but most importantly the influencers. This combination of youtube, web and influencers is something that no-one in the market is delivering at the moment and really moves the needle on sales for brands.</p><p>Once they have the advertising, sales and subscription sales sorted, they can then evolve to a marketplace for gamers &#8211; leveraging their 300M walled garden of engaged gamers. (Stage 4) &nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;So now that we have an opportunity and so for the present time despite all the success that we've had recently with direct sales we're probably only selling two percent of our inventory directly to the customer, but when you sell directly to the customer you're almost at a minimum 10x in your cpms. So every incremental two percent three percent shift of inventory from programmatic to direct has an outsized impact on margin. And so when we look at all of the things in front of us we think we can dramatically increase our gross margin like we did before with enthusiasts.</em></p><p><em>How complex and expensive is it to switch from programmatic to direct is it just a matter of hiring the sales people.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><p>Programmatic advertising on it&#8217;s own was probably at around $0.5c per user, and this was fairly bottom-of-the-barrel, low effort, easy to scale stuff &#8211; whereas if you layer in the data and the sales team and the subscriptions and the e-commerce, that&#8217;s when you could potentially go $5-$10 per user. So that&#8217;s where the focus is at the moment &#8211; building and scaling up the sales team in order to be able to implement this change from programmatic advertising to direct.</p><p>For an indication of this, in Jan 2020 the company had about 2 salespeople &#8211; now they have over 40. The intention is clear.</p><p>Much of the $120M in revenue from the previous years was due to programmatic ads. This change is the tip of the Iceberg.</p><h4><strong>5.4. CAC - Customer Acquisition Cost</strong></h4><p>One relatively hidden benefit of Enthusiast Gaming&#8217;s business model is the very low (allegedly $0) CAC. This is also arguably their deepest moat.</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;The thing that blows people away &#8211; and is routed in our content and approach &#8211; is when I tell them we don&#8217;t spend a single cent in acquiring or keeping that traffic coming back. They won&#8217;t believe it. Building a world-class business routed in user-generated content is definitely a very hard thing to do &#8211; and when you succeed it is a very hard thing to explain! There is a lot of art as to how it&#8217;s curated, how its presented, but when you can do it well, the sky is the limit for you in terms of possibilities.&#8221; - <strong>Adrian Montgomery</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>Silicon Valley tend to ask the question &#8220;is your CAC lower than your LTV?&#8221;</p><p>All this growth in ARPU with $0 CAC (due to owning both the traffic and data) will lead to outsized margin increases over time. The moat is that there isn&#8217;t anyone else in the industry with an audience as large and highly-engaged as EGLX. The company don&#8217;t spend money to drive traffic to their sites &#8211; the traffic comes organically. Therefore it is virtually impossible to replicate an audience as large and as loyal. Those 300M people consume over 4.5B views per month.</p><h4><strong>5.5.

Enthusiast Gaming already has established partnerships with TikTok, Samsung, and Snapchat.&#8221;</em>  </p></blockquote><h4>5.6. Downsides of growth</h4><p>In terms of profitability, EGLX are still several years off &#8211; they are actively investing in growth as they see this as a huge potential opportunity. Everything is being ploughed back into the ability for the company to grow.</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;The alchemy of running a &#8216;user generated content&#8217; business is that it&#8217;s very hard to do and it's almost harder to explain, and the moment you lose that authentic and genuine edge the whole thing falls apart. Activision as an example &#8211; people wouldn't flock to Activision fan communities if they knew big brother was owning them and moderating them right and selling selling the data. We are focused on growth and uh but we could be profitable tomorrow if we so choose.&#8221; - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwVM6DKPw5Y">Adrian Montgomery CEO</a></em></p></blockquote><p>Growing and scaling as a business is hard. Short term profitability usually needs to be overlooked in favour of long-term gains.</p><h2>6. Acquisitions/partnerships</h2><p>Acquisitions and partnerships are a key aspect of the growth strategy. In this section I will very briefly touch on some of the acquisitions/partnerships Enthusiast gaming have made over the recent past. </p><p>So far, we&#8217;re looking at 16 acquisitions in the past 4 years. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c21d03a-31d3-4318-a337-06803ede283b_603x735.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c21d03a-31d3-4318-a337-06803ede283b_603x735.png" width="421" height="513.1592039800995" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5c21d03a-31d3-4318-a337-06803ede283b_603x735.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:735,&quot;width&quot;:603,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:421,&quot;bytes&quot;:90602,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c21d03a-31d3-4318-a337-06803ede283b_603x735.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c21d03a-31d3-4318-a337-06803ede283b_603x735.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c21d03a-31d3-4318-a337-06803ede283b_603x735.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c21d03a-31d3-4318-a337-06803ede283b_603x735.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>In addition to the various acquisitions over the past several years (above), the company owns 6 e-sports teams including (Vancouver Titans - Overwatch, Seattle Surge - CoD, Luminosity - Fortnite, and Luminosity - Valorant)</p><p>Some of the most notable recent acquisitions include&#8230;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Omnia Media </strong>- &#8220;<em>Omnia owns content brands that matter to fans who love gaming and pop culture including BBC Gaming, Arcade Cloud and Wisecrack.&#8221; </em></p><p>Enthusiast Gaming has announced the launch of BCC Gaming, its first free, ad-supported streaming channel, which is available on Samsung TV Plus, Samsung&#8217;s free Smart TV video service, in the US.</p><p>This licensing and distribution activity is the latest result of Enthusiast Gaming&#8217;s recent acquisition of Omnia Media, which extends the company from one that was previously focused on online esports and gaming communities to one that produces and distributes premium, original content.</p></li><li><p><strong>Icy Veins - </strong>acquisition of Vedatis, which owns&nbsp;Icy Veins&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;a platform dedicated to guides for Activision Blizzard games including&nbsp;<em>Hearthstone,&nbsp;World of Warcraft</em>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;for &#8364;7M EUR ($8.51M USD).  </p><p>Enthusiast Gaming expects the acquisition &#8220;<em>to be accretive to Enthusiast Gaming&#8217;s revenue and margins and demonstrates opportunity for increased monetization through the company&#8217;s proprietary flywheel, which includes YouTube channels, subscriptions, content licensing, and e-commerce.&#8221;&nbsp;  </em></p></li><li><p><strong>Tabstats - </strong>A step in the direction of increased social interaction on the platform. &#8220;<em>GenZ and Millennial audiences have been moving away from traditional social networks and turning to gaming as an alternative,&#8221;&nbsp;</em><strong>commented Adrian Montgomery, CEO of Enthusiast Gaming.&nbsp;</strong><em>&#8220;Project GG addresses these trends and will allow gamers to register their unique gaming profiles, compare stats, develop meaningful connections, and share content and ideas.&#8221;&nbsp;</em><strong>He continued,</strong><em>&nbsp;&#8220;Tabwire marks an important milestone for Enthusiast Gaming to be able to bring Project GG to market later this year.

Collab with Coldplay</strong></h4><p>Coldplay are a historically innovative music act. One of the, if not the, first bands to licence their music to iTunes. That deal was done directly with Steve Jobs by licencing &#8216;viva la vida&#8217; for an iTunes commercial and ended up winning a grammy.</p><p><a href="https://luminosity.gg/zhu-partners-with-enthusiast-gaming/">EGLX have a content creator in Luminosity called ZHU</a>, who is one of the leading EDM DJ&#8217;s. The idea is for ZHU to remix &#8216;Higher Power&#8217; by Coldplay.</p><p>EGLX created an event showcasing the remix, along with a performance from Coldplay. Really interesting cultural crossover between mainstream music and gaming.</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Coldplay are timeless, cross-generational musicians, and we look forward to serving as a bridge between them and our global gaming audience. While this is the first collaboration of its kind for us and in the gaming space, our platform provides immense opportunity for similar experiences in the future.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><p>EGLX are taking over the world &#8211; and it&#8217;s not just in video gaming. The interesting thing here is the intersection between music &amp; gaming, fashion &amp; gaming, lifestyle &amp; gaming etc. </p><p>Adrian Montgomery goes on to make some really interesting points about attracting the entrenched investors who may not be keeping up with pop-culture. This collab with Coldplay is something that may spark their attention. EGLX will be doing more with Coldplay and other mediums of entertainment outside gaming.</p><h4>6.2. Torstar JV</h4><p>More recently EGLX form a Joint Venture with Torstar to launch an online news channel - creating an original news platform and community named AFK.</p><blockquote><p><em>"AFK is a new brand that brings insight and community to issues that matter to gamers in a tone and format that feels familiar to them, such as short-form video content and message boards on digital-first platforms." </em> </p></blockquote><ul><li><p>Gen-Z focus: short vids + digital first approach</p></li><li><p>Content creation seems a big focus here</p></li></ul><p>This one is particularly interesting to me as EGLX seems to really be putting together the beginnings of a &#8216;platform-like&#8217; experience.</p><h2>7. Bull &amp; Bear Case</h2><h4>7.1. Bull</h4><ol><li><p>Global Reach of engaged audience members (300M)</p></li><li><p>Capitalizing on revolution in how GenZ and Millenials spend social time. Creating the beginnings of a gaming-orientated social network.</p></li><li><p>Strong monetisation strategy with strong present and future revenue streams.</p></li><li><p>Multiple growth opportunities with significant upside potential.</p></li><li><p>Optionality.

Enthusiast owns all of their users data along with the direct traffic which will be extremely valuable moving forwards. This puts them in a good position to sell user data and use it as a freemium model &#8211; i.e. people can access content for free with the assumption of being able to use their data. This will be valuable because it&#8217;s a very niche and very targeted audience meaning they can sell the advertising space/data at a significant premium.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Undervalued compared to industry peers.</p></li><li><p>Great overall exposure to gaming sector - game/trend agnostic.</p></li></ol><h4>7.2.

However, it&#8217;s important to note the surprisingly low levels of profitability (or even losses) which are being sustained.</p><p>A gross margin on a TTM basis (Trailing Twelve Months) of 27.38% along with an operating margin and net profit margin of -34.39% and -46.01% respectively is less than ideal. However, management have long-term profitability planned for further down the line. As stated in several interviews with the CEO, if the company wanted to become profitable in the next quarter, they could. However growth is the key factor which is currently overriding the need to take profits.</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;I think that we can similarly vault the gross margin up going forward and the reason is because as menasha had alluded to, historically we'd only ever sold our ads programmatically and we didn't have a direct sales function and we were selling for the most commoditized cost per thousands that we could that are out there because we were building the audience first. </em></p></blockquote><p>I would say there isn&#8217;t really much use is comparing gross profit, operating profit and net profit with gaming industry counterparts due to the fact EGLX are purposefully operating at a loss for the time being as part of the long-term strategy.</p><p>I like this long-term thinking from management.</p><h4>9.3.

The decrease in esports and entertainment revenue was a direct result of Covid 19 and the inability to host an in-person event.</p></li><li><p> <strong>Subscriptions - </strong>revenue generated from paid subscribers to various offerings within the ecosystem. The increase between 2020 and 2021 is mainly due to to an increase in paid subscribers on &#8216;The Sims Resource&#8217;. EGLX had approximately 92,000 paid subscribers as at March 31 2020, increasing to 137,000 paid subscribers as at March 31 2021. </p></li></ol><h4>9.4.

The company&#8217;s total assets easily cover the current &amp; total liabilities which allows the company to pursue the strategy of growth via acquisitions. The one negative is the fact that current assets does not cover the total liabilities.  This ratio of 0.81 has improved since March 2020 where the current assets/total liability ratio sat at 0.35. Ideally I would like to see an increase to above 1.0.  </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f9b9df6-ac08-4185-b208-437f7bc93b09_852x214.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f9b9df6-ac08-4185-b208-437f7bc93b09_852x214.png" width="852" height="214" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2f9b9df6-ac08-4185-b208-437f7bc93b09_852x214.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:214,&quot;width&quot;:852,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:79449,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f9b9df6-ac08-4185-b208-437f7bc93b09_852x214.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f9b9df6-ac08-4185-b208-437f7bc93b09_852x214.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f9b9df6-ac08-4185-b208-437f7bc93b09_852x214.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f9b9df6-ac08-4185-b208-437f7bc93b09_852x214.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>As of 31st March 2021, the company&#8217;s cash position is relatively strong, although not entirely positive.

With TTM annual revenue at $73.6m, it puts the company at an EV/Sales ratio of 7.981.

Conclusion</h2><p>Enthusiast Gaming are a fascinating company operating in a rapidly evolving industry.</p><p>If the company are able to execute in their goal of creating an engaged community of over 300M monthly active users, then there will be significant scope to increase monetization and become a very profitable company.</p><p>There are still major obstacles to overcome with regards to growth - i.e. executing on the four-step plan they have in place. However, if EG can successfully cultivate a community of lucrative gamers, then the sky is the limit.</p><p>If you wan&#8217;t to get exposure to the gaming industry, EGLX are one of the only publicly traded options in the gaming space. </p><ul><li><p>The company interact with over 300M gaming enthusiasts/fans every month. </p></li><li><p>43% of every American male visits one of EGLX&#8217;s properties every month. </p></li><li><p>Gaming communities are going to become increasingly more valuable. </p></li><li><p>EGLX are possibly the only vertically integrated gaming company in the world right now.</p></li></ul><p>When investing, we are more-or-less looking for monopolies. So then we have to ask ourselves the question - &#8220;Can Enthusiast Gaming&#8217;s core business be easily replicated at a similar scale?&#8221; - and I think the answer is no, at least not easily and not without compromising the authenticity required for success.</p><p>To conclude, I believe Enthusiast Gaming is a great way to gain exposure to the evolving Gaming/Esports industy. Valuation is hard at these early stages of development, although I believe there will be significant upside if they can meet/beat ARPU and user-growth expectations.</p><p>The opportunity is not without risks (mainly financials). However, my confidence in the gaming sector combined with the vision of EGLX so far has led me to begin a speculative position.</p><p>I will be keeping a close eye on this one for the upcoming quarters.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Innovestor.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard Deep-Dive]]></title><description><![CDATA[The past, present and future of gaming]]></description><link>https://innovestor.substack.com/p/activision-blizzard-deep-dive</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://innovestor.substack.com/p/activision-blizzard-deep-dive</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Innovestor]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jun 2021 13:57:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f372e4b0-59ff-442b-a5ed-7b16bbed8692_1920x1080.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Thesis</h2><p>Alongside being one of the most dominant publishers on earth with a rich library of intellectual property at their disposal, Activision Blizzard have positioned themselves in a way to be able to effectively capitalise on the upcoming tailwinds within the industry.</p><p>Gaming is slowly but steadily creeping its way towards being the new <a href="https://ark-invest.com/newsletters/issue-249/">&#8216;third place&#8217;</a> - with millions of users playing games simply to meet with friends.

That failed, spurring Bobby to round up a bunch of investors to buy the &#8216;Activision&#8217; name and its assets out of bankruptcy for $500k. </p><p>By 1995, Kotick had achieved the promise he made to the investors: that he would give them four years of 50% growth in revenues while remaining break-even. After reaching this initial goal, Kotick then set course on achieving the second promise he made to the investors: to develop high-demand games and make the company profitable.</p><p>Shortly after this, Bobby spearheaded various successful strategic acquisitions - leading the company to major success over the following 3 decades. Three of the main developments over recent years include:</p><ul><li><p>Infinity Ward Purchase in 2003 for $5M. The global gaming franchise is now worth billions in revenue on an annual basis.</p></li><li><p>The merger with Blizzard in 2008. Blizzard owns some of the most valuable and popular gaming IP on the planet - inluding Diablo, Starcraft, and Overwatch.</p></li><li><p>Acquisition of London-based &#8216;King&#8217; in 2016 for $5.9B (The $5.9 billion price Activision is paying, at $18/share, is well below the&nbsp;2014 IPO price of $22.50 a share). King make mobile gaming titles such as Candy Crush.</p></li></ul><h2>The business</h2><p>The composition of ATVI&#8217;s business has changed over the years with several large acquisitions. The company is made up of three primary aspects - <strong>&#8216;Activision Puiblishing Inc.&#8217;</strong>, <strong>&#8216;Blizzard Entertainment Inc.&#8217;</strong> and <strong>&#8216;King Digital Entertainment&#8217;. </strong>Activision produces titles like Call of Duty, Blizzard Entertainment produces titles such as Diablo, Starcraft, World of Warcraft and Overwatch. And &#8216;King Digital Entertainment&#8217; is a mobile development/publishing team with the most famous title being Candy Crush.</p><p>In terms of revenues, we don&#8217;t know the exact details of the splits - however the estimate is that a large chunk (~70%) comes from just a handful of the titles.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e84420d-dfe2-45d2-9647-fd1c13062651_804x456.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e84420d-dfe2-45d2-9647-fd1c13062651_804x456.jpeg" width="804" height="456" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1e84420d-dfe2-45d2-9647-fd1c13062651_804x456.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:456,&quot;width&quot;:804,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:100732,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e84420d-dfe2-45d2-9647-fd1c13062651_804x456.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e84420d-dfe2-45d2-9647-fd1c13062651_804x456.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e84420d-dfe2-45d2-9647-fd1c13062651_804x456.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e84420d-dfe2-45d2-9647-fd1c13062651_804x456.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h4>Activition</h4><ul><li><p>Activision&#8217;s main goal is releasing annual Call of Duty titles on various consoles and PC to achieve what is essentially recurring revenue.</p></li><li><p>Currently the 3rd best selling video game franchise of all time with roughly 400M copies sold - behind Mario (805M) and Tetris (495M).</p></li><li><p>Call of Duty is almost certainly the company&#8217;s most valuable piece of Intellectual Property.</p></li><li><p>In late 2019 Activision made the decision to bring the Call of Duty franchise over to mobile - which increased the MAU (monthly active users) by <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/02/12/activision-blizzard-new-players-q4-mobile.aspx">93M almost overnight</a>.</p></li><li><p>The introduction of the free-to-play Battle Royale element to Call of Duty (Warzone) was released on March 10th 2020 just before the pandemic and has been a roaring succcess.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Because of it, during the second quarter of 2020, the hours played increased eight fold year on year. On PC, the hours played were double Black Ops 4, showing Activision that free to play is the right direction for a battle royale game, especially when plenty of great free to play BRs exist, such as Fortnite and Apex Legends. Revenue also hit a new record, increasing by five from last year due to the game&#8217;s battle passes, Call Of Duty points, premium store purchases etc.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><ul><li><p>Recently launched Call of Duty League (E-Sports) showing the value of owning your own IP. Comparing this to the termination of the destiny contract with Bungie in 2019 which negatively impacted the MAU - showing the opposite side of IP ownership.</p></li><li><p>&#8216;Free to play&#8217; models and E-sports will likely be a go-to business model moving forwards.</p></li></ul><h4>Blizzard</h4><p>Blizzard has a handful of very successful IP&#8217;s for which they create new content - though not on a yearly basis like Call of Duty - these include Diablo, Overwatch, StarCraft, and World of Warcraft (possibly the most popular PC title worldwide).</p><ul><li><p>The majority of revenue here comes from the monthly/yearly subscriptions from WoW for which Blizzard produce regular updates.</p></li><li><p>As mentioned above, the major difference between Activision and Blizzard titles is the frequency of releases - Blizzard being the less frequent, with bigger spikes in revenue.</p></li><li><p>The margins on subscriptions for WoW are significantly higher than other areas of the business - making WoW one of the most profitable divisions.</p></li><li><p>Overwatch was a relatively new addition which has since subdued in terms of revenues and viewing figures - however with the introduction of the Overwatch e-sports leagues and the upcoming release of Overwatch 2, this could change.</p></li></ul><h4>King</h4><p>The acquisition of King Entertainment in 2016 was a huge deal for ATVI as it allowed the company to add &#8216;mobile gaming&#8217; to their armory. </p><blockquote><p><strong>Bobby Kotick</strong> - <em>&#8220;We see great opportunities to create new ways for audiences to experience their favorite franchises, from Candy Crush to World of Warcraft to Call of Duty and more, across mobile devices, consoles and personal computers</em>&#8221;  </p></blockquote><p>One of King&#8217;s main titles, Candy Crush, is responsible for the lions share of the company&#8217;s revenue. Monthly Active Users fell by almost 40% in the first three years after the acquisition whilst revenue increased. This suggests the on-boarding of the Activision Blizzard strategy - to increase focus on the top performing franchises.</p><h2>Strategy</h2><p>ATVI&#8217;s strategy is to increase reach and engagement by reinvesting into existing franchises and adding new ones where appropriate. We have seen this recently with the renewed focus on Call of Duty - focusing on the free to play aspect along with e-sports.</p><p>Taking notes from Disney, the strategy of monetising across all mediums of entertainment is a proven strategy - and one that keeps users engaged.</p><h4>Free-to-play</h4><p>The free-to-play format has been around for several years now, with EPIC leading the way in the implementation of their immensely popular titles such as Fortnite and Rocket League. These titles have pioneered a whole new norm in the gaming industry.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6cdc6db-91ed-451b-a398-1d842008e2e9_1243x681.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6cdc6db-91ed-451b-a398-1d842008e2e9_1243x681.png" width="1243" height="681" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d6cdc6db-91ed-451b-a398-1d842008e2e9_1243x681.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:681,&quot;width&quot;:1243,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:159772,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6cdc6db-91ed-451b-a398-1d842008e2e9_1243x681.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6cdc6db-91ed-451b-a398-1d842008e2e9_1243x681.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6cdc6db-91ed-451b-a398-1d842008e2e9_1243x681.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6cdc6db-91ed-451b-a398-1d842008e2e9_1243x681.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>In 2018, Fortnite made <a href="https://in.ign.com/fortnite/131791/news/fortnite-made-the-most-annual-revenue-of-any-game-in-history-last-year">$2.4 Billion</a>&nbsp;in revenue &#8212; the most annual revenue for any game in the history of the gaming industry, a record which is yet to be broken. Despite this fact, Fortnite accounted only for 2.2% of the gaming industry&#8217;s 2018 annual global revenue, which stood at $109 Billion.</p><p>In March 2020, ATVI entered the &#8216;free-to-play&#8217; chat with <em>Call of Duty: &#8216;Warzone&#8217;</em> - a Battle-Royale style model with revenue solely coming from in-game purchases.</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;While ATVI does not breakdown in-game bookings revenue by segment, they noted in&nbsp;<a href="https://investor.activision.com/static-files/2d66791b-ca74-439a-87e8-7cd443b44c9a">Q2 2020</a>&nbsp;that Call of Duty in-game net bookings more than doubled quarter over quarter and were around five times higher than a year ago. In&nbsp;<a href="https://investor.activision.com/static-files/926e411c-7d05-49f8-a855-6dc7646e84c4">Q3 2020,</a>&nbsp;they noted that in-game bookings revenue was four times higher than a year earlier.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><p>Typically, game development teams work on a seasonal basis - with games being worked on throughout the year to be released before Christmas, therefore seeing big spikes in revenue in Q4 depending on how many copies have been sold. With this new model, ATVI were able to show quarterly revenues of over $1.9B for the first time in the company&#8217;s history outside of a seasonally strong Q4. There were some obvious tailwinds in the form of the global pandemic, however this increase in revenue was not driven by title sales, but rather in-game purchases - which is significant.</p><h4>E-Sports</h4><p>Among other initiatives such as TV/Entertainment and consumer products, Activision has been keeping a close eye on the e-sports industry which has been going from strength-to-strength over the past couple of years.</p><p>The company focus on two main opportunities within the esports realm - Overwatch League and Call of Duty League. </p><p><em>Overwatch</em>&nbsp;League was launched in 2018 and was the first city-based esports league. The general structure is similar to that of a standard sports league - with city-based teams competing against each-other. Activision Blizzard have allowed entrepreneurs to run these teams as businesses, allowing the owners to share profits as the league grows. Another important distinction compared to other e-sports leagues is the fact that Blizzard operates and organises the whole thing - taking full control of their IP. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf6a223e-a936-479b-8931-d181f34e0993_1024x490.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf6a223e-a936-479b-8931-d181f34e0993_1024x490.jpeg" width="635" height="303.857421875" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bf6a223e-a936-479b-8931-d181f34e0993_1024x490.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:490,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:635,&quot;bytes&quot;:75847,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf6a223e-a936-479b-8931-d181f34e0993_1024x490.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf6a223e-a936-479b-8931-d181f34e0993_1024x490.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf6a223e-a936-479b-8931-d181f34e0993_1024x490.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf6a223e-a936-479b-8931-d181f34e0993_1024x490.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The Call of Duty league is more recent having kicked-off at the beginning of 2020. The reason CoD is being preferred as an investment over other IP like World of Warcraft is due to the fact that first person shooters are a much more widely played gaming genre and is therefore more marketable/profitable when selling to a mass audience.</p><p>With regards to revenue and growth, it is tricky to ascertain the exact level coming from these e-sports leagues as the company classifies this revenue as &#8216;other&#8217;. However, we can see the growth has been somewhat modest from 2019 to 2020 at only 6% - representing roughly 8.5% of total revenues.

There is still a long way to go before we see this thesis play out, however the foresight to solidify themselves as part of the infrastructure within the industry seems like a winning strategy.</p><h2>Gaming market</h2><p>The gaming market is a complex beast It would take far too long for me to go into the granular details within this report, however I&#8217;ll attempt to outline the wider landscape for context.</p><p>Many among us will not realize the scale of this sector, but the gaming industry has grown to become the largest subset of the entertainment industry.&nbsp;Even bigger than the movie &amp; music industry, both of which combined made&nbsp;$60.8 Billion globally&nbsp;in 2018. Around&nbsp;80% of the total gaming industry revenue&nbsp;in 2018 and 2019 was attributed to the free-to-play business model.&nbsp;</p><p>Video games have developed significantly over the past 20 years. Anything pre the year 2000 we were playing offline - it involved you on your own or with a friend sitting next to you. </p><p>With the widespread adoption of the internet in the early 2000&#8217;s came &#8216;social gaming&#8217; - where you could be in your lounge playing against a player on the other side of the world. This phenomenon kick-started the growth in the gaming industry as gaming was no longer an anti-social activity and enabled a competitive element.</p><p>Roughly 10 years ago, the industry was more heavily concentrated towards console gaming (50%) with PC gaming making up about 33% and mobile only about 5%. This has changed dramatically over recent years, with mobile gaming growing to 33%, PC gaming dropping to 26% and console gaming dropping to 30%.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F750615a0-1273-4cc9-9537-fae1d64be860_687x363.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F750615a0-1273-4cc9-9537-fae1d64be860_687x363.jpeg" width="687" height="363" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/750615a0-1273-4cc9-9537-fae1d64be860_687x363.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:363,&quot;width&quot;:687,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:48274,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F750615a0-1273-4cc9-9537-fae1d64be860_687x363.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F750615a0-1273-4cc9-9537-fae1d64be860_687x363.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F750615a0-1273-4cc9-9537-fae1d64be860_687x363.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F750615a0-1273-4cc9-9537-fae1d64be860_687x363.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/mobile-game-spending-hits-record-1-7b-per-week-in-q1-2021-up-40-from-pre-pandemic-levels/?tpcc=ECTW2020">This article outlines the huge potential growth happening currently in mobile gaming industry.</a> To summarise:</p><ul><li><p>Covid drove demand for mobile gaming. This demand doesn&#8217;t seem to be reducing as Covid is slowly going away. </p></li><li><p>Users worldwide downloaded 30% more games in the first quarter of 2021 than in the fourth quarter of 2019 </p></li><li><p>Spent a record-breaking $1.7 billion per week in mobile games in Q1 2021. That figure is up 40% from pre-pandemic levels.</p></li></ul><p>Activision Blizzard have done a good job of changing their product mix over this period of time to represent the changes happening within the industry - most notably with the acquisition of King (mobile games) in 2016.</p><h4>Growth</h4><p>Even though 2020 was an abnormally good year for the gaming industry (and ATVI in general) it doesn&#8217;t look like growth is slowing.</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Call of Duty&nbsp;mobile reached 500 million total downloads during the first quarter, helping the company as a whole generate $2.9 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow -- 103% more than the same period a year ago.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><p>Moving with the times in order to target a whole new player-base has enabled Activision to dramatically increase their user-base</p><p>By adapting a long-loved franchise to new systems,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;was able to dramatically expand its potential player pool. The CEO Bobby Kotick has expressed his desire to carry forward this formula to other games - "<em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;is the template we're applying to our proven franchises."  </p><p>It&#8217;s hard to predict the growth within the gaming industry as it&#8217;s constantly evolving and adapting to various technologies. For example, we have completely new gaming mediums coming into play over the next decade such as Virtual and Augmented reality - we have no idea how these will play out over the long-term.</p><p>We can, however, draw some generic insights (<a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/video-game-market">Grand View Research</a>):</p><ul><li><p><em>Free2Play (F2P), Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO), and multiplayer games have progressively gained popularity, a trend which is anticipated to continue over the next eight years. </em></p></li><li><p><em>The rising disposable income level is leading to an increased consumer spending on gaming products. </em></p></li><li><p><em>Large-scale adoption of more advanced gaming consoles equipped with sophisticated features such as record and share and cross-platform gameplay.</em></p></li><li><p><em>The trend of social media gaming is expected to have a positive impact on shaping up the market growth. For instance, a substantial percentage of the global population use social networking sites such as Facebook and Reddit for gaming. </em></p></li><li><p><em>Growing popularity of eSports tournaments and the increasing number of professional gamers are anticipated to increase sales of video games and accessories along with gaming hardware and software.</em></p></li><li><p><em>The video game market is experiencing high demand in various avenues such as educational institutes and corporate enterprises.

However, the actual potential for gamification possibilities in the academia vertical is being exploited only recently.</em></p></li></ul><p>Some independent growth projections include:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/video-game-market">Grand View Research</a> predict the U.S. gaming market to increase from $151B in 2019 to $450B in 2028 at a CAGR of 12.9%</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/01/2184028/0/en/Global-Gaming-Market-2021-to-2026-Industry-Trends-Share-Size-Growth-Opportunity-and-Forecasts.html">Research and Markets</a> predict the global gaming market to reach a value of US$ 287.1 Billion by 2026, exhibiting a CAGR of 9.24%.</p></li></ul><h4>Metaverse</h4><p>As mentioned above, one of the most interesting aspects of the gaming industry is the increase in social inter-connectivity. A more and more widely held belief is that video games are beginning to act as not simply a place to play games, but a place to hang out with friends.</p><p>This brings us onto the subject of the Metaverse, which is a complex and relatively undefined area in its own right - but is likely to be crucial for the future of gaming and the way we connect.

In fact, nothing even comes close. That being said, there are some examples of metaverse-like &#8216;ideas&#8217; present within modern gaming and more specifically the Battle-Royale games such as CoD and Fortnite.</p><ul><li><p>Cross platform play.</p></li><li><p>Increasing number of concurrent players (CoD experimenting with 150 players in a lobby).</p></li><li><p>Custom avatars more common.

Not necessarily anything to do with a &#8216;metaverse&#8217; - but it will likely share some of the social aspects. </p><p>Activision will benefit from this in the sense that once we learn how to play the game and our friends learn how to play the game - we have purchased our in-game items, upgraded our weapons etc. it will be a much harder mental task to switch to another game. </p><p>In addition, the positive social re-enforcements we get from playing the game with friends that connects winning a game (for example) to CoD is another strength for the IP. The gamer is far more likely to go out and purchase something Call of Duty branded because they have that positive experience.</p><p>I remember making a similar argument for <a href="https://innovestor.substack.com/p/disney-deep-dive">Disney</a> in a previous article, where strong IP mixed with positive experiences and the optionallity to purchase that IP via a different medium is a powerful thing.</p><p>Overall, the increases in social experiences within gaming can only be good for ATVI as more players use the games as a place to meet. </p><h2>Management</h2><h5><strong>Bobby Kotick - CEO</strong></h5><p>As mentioned earlier in the article, Bobby Kotick is an interesting character with a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/16/business/bobby-kotick-of-activision-drawing-praise-and-wrath.html">rich history</a>. Interestingly, he has also proven himself to be an astute CEO with an incredible eye for detail and a healthy obsession with capital allocation (similar to Warren Buffett) - indicating in past shareholder letters that he looks up to the famous investor.</p><p>Bobby is young for a CEO at 57 years old, yet has over 30 years experience of successfully growing and operating Activision. </p><p>He is passionate about the business and has over 2.5million shares in the company - so a large personal stake. </p><p><em>&#8220;I think that you can&#8217;t do what I&#8217;ve done for 30 years without that relentless focus on doing better. I come to work each day wanting to improve. And so I think that commitment to excellence, and wanting to improve can come across sometimes as dissatisfaction or unreasonableness.&#8221;  </em></p><h5><strong>Dennis Durkin/Armin Zerza - CFO#</strong></h5><p>Dennis Durkin worked at Microsoft for 12 years and as the CFO/COO of Xbox, before joining ATVI in 2012 as the CFO. The insights Dennis was able to bring from Microsoft (semi-competitor) I&#8217;m sure will have been invaluable over the years.</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Dennis has been a key contributor in some of the most value-creating moments of our history, including the buyback of control from Vivendi in 2013 and our expansion into mobile through the acquisition of King.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><p>In the most recent earnings call the company announced the appointment of the new CFO - Armin Zezra.</p><blockquote><p><em>"&#8220;Also in the service of our shareholders, I'm pleased to introduce Armin Zerza as our new chief financial officer. Armin's deep experience as a global finance and operations executive and his contributions as chief operating officer of Blizzard and chief commercial officer of the company, make him especially well suited to serve as our next CFO.</em></p><p><em>In his six years with the company, Armin has been a central figure in the company's continued growth and record financial results. He has the commitment to profitable growth and operational excellence that our shareholders have always recognized us for. And Armin comes to the role with an incredible team assembled by Dennis and Thomas over the last decade.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><h2>Bull Case</h2><p><strong>1. Strong IP: </strong></p><ul><li><p>Activision Blizzad are in a strong position with their intellectual property - a position they have built up over the past 3 decades by creating and acquiring new innovative content. Arguably, however, the Call of Duty franchise is the the most valuable aspect in the ATVI ecosystem, although WoW, <em>Diablo</em>, <em>StarCraft</em>, <em>Candy Crush </em>and <em>Overwatch </em>all have potential to be strong brands.</p><p>The first CoD title was created and released in 2003 by a games development studio called Infinity Ward which was purchased by ATVI. The first release garnered a Metacritic score of 91 - making it rank within the top 3% of all time games. Since then, the company have released a new version every year.</p><p>The CoD franchise has sold more than 400 million units to-date, cementing is as the number 3 all-time highest selling franchise behind Mario (~805M) and Tetris (~495M). The brand loyalty Call of Duty has built up over the past 20ish years is unmatched.</p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8767471-3e27-48da-98db-7000937e0c0d_1200x675.webp"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8767471-3e27-48da-98db-7000937e0c0d_1200x675.webp" width="1200" height="675" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f8767471-3e27-48da-98db-7000937e0c0d_1200x675.webp&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:675,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:73512,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8767471-3e27-48da-98db-7000937e0c0d_1200x675.webp 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8767471-3e27-48da-98db-7000937e0c0d_1200x675.webp 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8767471-3e27-48da-98db-7000937e0c0d_1200x675.webp 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8767471-3e27-48da-98db-7000937e0c0d_1200x675.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><strong>2.

Adopting free-to-play business model:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Similar to the point above, the adoption of the &#8216;free-to-play&#8217; business model has given the company a new lease of life - stimulating overall engagement as well as in-game sales.</p></li></ul><p><strong>5. Optionality from IP:</strong></p><ul><li><p>The benefit for ATVI of having a large user-base emotionally invested in your IP is that they have the ability to create revenue generating content/products outside of gaming alone.</p></li></ul><p><strong>6. Benefit of scale:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Most large gaming franchises like CoD also receive some scale benefits. </p><p>If we take marketing as an example, Activision most likely spends over $200 million on marketing alone for a single Call of Duty game release. Then when you compare this to other game franchises that would struggle to make $200 million in revenue, you can begin to see the benefit of scale. </p><p>Additionally, due to the sheer popularity of the game with streamers, (currently number 2 behind Fortnite) the CoD title will reach much larger audiences - and engaged audiences at that. This fact alone will more than likely lower the unit cost of marketing via these channels.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c38a322-d6ac-44cf-a5bf-ab26924c1706_1045x386.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c38a322-d6ac-44cf-a5bf-ab26924c1706_1045x386.png" width="1045" height="386" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2c38a322-d6ac-44cf-a5bf-ab26924c1706_1045x386.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:386,&quot;width&quot;:1045,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:64956,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c38a322-d6ac-44cf-a5bf-ab26924c1706_1045x386.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c38a322-d6ac-44cf-a5bf-ab26924c1706_1045x386.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c38a322-d6ac-44cf-a5bf-ab26924c1706_1045x386.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c38a322-d6ac-44cf-a5bf-ab26924c1706_1045x386.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Lastly, the strategy of using the current large user-base to market other titles &#8216;in-game&#8217; is proving to be a useful too. For example, the free-to-play Warzone game held an in-game event to release the trailer of the new 2020 Cold War game. Over 1 million people turned up to participate in this event. </p></li></ul><p><strong>7. tailwinds from the pandemic:</strong></p><ul><li><p>ATVI were clearly one of the major beneficiaries of the global pandemic. With millions of people out of work and having more free time, video-games became a standard past-time. Revenue rose 24.6% to $8.1 billion, while net income rose 46.2% to $2.2 billion.  </p></li></ul><p><strong>8. Experienced management</strong></p><ul><li><p>Management have a history of good decision-making with acquisitions, pay cuts and over 30 years of experience within the gaming business.</p></li></ul><h2>Bear Case</h2><p><strong>1. Increased competition:</strong></p><ul><li><p>As with any expanding industry, the level of competition increases as the potential opportunity becomes more clear. Alongside this, the barrier to entry for becoming a game developer is reducing significantly.</p></li></ul><p><strong>2. Too concentrated on one franchise:</strong> </p><ul><li><p>The trouble with focusing too heavily on only a handful of franchises/IP&#8217;s is the risk that players and developers essentially get bored. Also, the over-reliance on one source of revenue is a huge risk.</p><p>IP fatigue is real risk (for both players and developers). In order to tackle this issue the company had to innovate. The CEO stated in a recent interview about giving control to the dev team - <em>&#8220;They&#8217;re the ones that make the decisions about what the product is going to be or what content they&#8217;re going to create,&#8221; &#8220;And the business is way too large for me to be able to get involved in those kinds of decisions. I don&#8217;t have the skills that our heads of studios and heads of franchises have.&#8221;</em>  </p><p>The company&#8217;s ability to create high-quality content consistently is a massive factor in the continued success.</p></li></ul><p><strong>3. Are they really innovating enough?</strong></p><ul><li><p>The question has to be asked whether ATVI are innovating as much as they could be considering the lack of presence in the AR/VR industry (as one example).</p><p>My opinion on this one is that yes, the company are doing enough. They are experimenting with mobile, free-to-play and e-sports already. Bobby Kotick stated recently that <em>&#8220;Activision Blizzard will not roll out VR products until we feel like we are pushing the art form forward." </em> </p></li></ul><p><strong>4. Questions over management:</strong></p><ul><li><p>On one hand it could be argued management have shown some level of insensitivity. For example, in 2019 the company laid off 800 employees after a very successful 2019.

performance</a></h4><p><strong>Bobby Kotick -</strong><em> &#8220;Everything was up, year over year. Call of Duty was up. Candy Crush was up considerably. Blizzard was up. Across the board, the business is going well. The pattern is strong. Free-to-play introduces people to the franchise.&#8221;</em></p><ul><li><p>27% revenue growth to $2.28 billion for the first quarter ended March 31</p></li><li><p>Activision Blizzard (including King) had 435 million MAU&#8217;s, compared to 397 million MAU&#8217;s in the previous quarter. Kotick said in the earnings call that the goal is to hit a billion users, and he noted Call of Duty gained more than 100 million players in the past year</p></li></ul><h5>Activision</h5><ul><li><p>Activision&#8217;s&nbsp;Call of Duty franchise&nbsp;continued to outperform last year&#8217;s results as people continued to play a lot more games during the pandemic</p></li><li><p>MAU&#8217;s tripled over the past couple of years, with the current number sitting at around 150M (up 40% from Q1 2020).</p></li><li><p>GAAP revenues for the first quarter ended March 31 were $2.28 billion, up 27% from $1.79 billion a year ago. GAAP EPS were 79 cents, compared to 65 cents a share a year earlier.  </p></li><li><p><em>Call of Duty: Mobile&#8217;s</em> debut in China in December generated tens of millions of new players, said Daniel Alegre (the chief operating officer of Activision Blizzard) in the analyst call.  </p></li></ul><h5>Blizzard</h5><ul><li><p>Revenue growth +7% from 1 year ago, led by strong growth in the Warcraft franchise. World of Warcraft&#8217;s Shadowlands expansion has grown, and Blizzard had 27 million MAUs in the first quarter.  </p></li><li><p>Overwatch expected to arrive in 2022.  </p></li></ul><h5>King</h5><ul><li><p>Revenue growth of 22% in the quarter</p></li><li><p>258 million MAU&#8217;s in the quarter (down from 273 million a year ago).</p></li><li><p>One driver of growth was <em>Crash Bandicoot: On the Run</em>, which launched March 25 and has seen more than 30 million downloads to date. That likely helped with MAUs.</p></li><li><p>70% growth in advertising net bookings in the first quarter, with significant increases across both direct brand advertisers and partner networks. Bookings have stayed strong in the second quarter</p></li><li><p>Mobile is continuing to benefit.</p></li></ul><h4>Rev vs EPS</h4><p>From first glance, over the past decade, EPS (earning per share) has been growing at an impressive average of 20% per year compared to revenues which have been averaging around 7% comparatively.</p><p>The explanation for the disparity between EPS and revenue growth is down to several factors. One is the move from physical to digital (higher margins) for which the whole of the gaming industry is experiencing. Two, Activision Blizzard repurchased 1/3 of their outstanding shares from <a href="https://www.vivendi.com/en/press-release/vivendi-to-sell-the-majority-of-its-interest-in-activision-blizzard-for-8-2-billion/">Vivendi in 2013 at roughly $13.60 per share</a>. That investment alone has returned an average of 28% per year against the cost of debt which was 5%.

This indicates the strategy of concentrating investments towards the most successful IP is clearly working.</p><p>Learning from companies like Disney &amp; Nintendo - maximising the potential of your best IP can be a winning strategy. And I think Activision Blizzard will be closely following this road-map.</p><h4>Revenue/profitability</h4><p>As a direct result of the increase in MAU&#8217;s, profitability has also been increasing for Activision. As the game has continued to mature, providing map updates, map alterations, gun additions, new characters and more &#8216;in-game&#8217; purchasing options - ATVI&#8217;s profitibility has began to noticeably increase.

On the other hand, the opportunity cost of holding so much excess cash is a reality if there are other, better, opportunities to invest in the market/projects at any given time.</p><p>Bobby kotick (CEO) has a reputation for prudent capital allocation as many of his philosophies regarding investing and capital management relates closely to those of Warren Buffett.</p><p>Adding to the above, and re-enforcing the point about waiting for the best opportunities to present themselves, the purchase of King in 2016 was a great opportunity at a reasonable cost.</p><h4>Cash Flow</h4><p>Taking a quick look at the cash flow situation - we can see ATVI operate a strong cash position, with the majority of the cash flow coming through their operations. Historically, as seen below, the Cash Flows have been somewhat predictable, following a seasonal nature, with the majority of sales (and therefore cash) coming at the end of the year (near christmas). The change in strategy towards &#8216;free-to-play&#8217; and ongoing e-sports leagues should result in more of a consistent cash stream - relying less on the success of the yearly titles. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c0505d1-75dd-4ee0-8b0b-d2a10c964820_863x512.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c0505d1-75dd-4ee0-8b0b-d2a10c964820_863x512.png" width="863" height="512" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8c0505d1-75dd-4ee0-8b0b-d2a10c964820_863x512.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:512,&quot;width&quot;:863,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:81260,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c0505d1-75dd-4ee0-8b0b-d2a10c964820_863x512.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c0505d1-75dd-4ee0-8b0b-d2a10c964820_863x512.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c0505d1-75dd-4ee0-8b0b-d2a10c964820_863x512.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c0505d1-75dd-4ee0-8b0b-d2a10c964820_863x512.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h2><strong>The Valuation</strong></h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7feb488a-8123-4fe4-9002-cae891d9ed4f_1092x132.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7feb488a-8123-4fe4-9002-cae891d9ed4f_1092x132.png" width="1092" height="132" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7feb488a-8123-4fe4-9002-cae891d9ed4f_1092x132.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:132,&quot;width&quot;:1092,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:22607,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7feb488a-8123-4fe4-9002-cae891d9ed4f_1092x132.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7feb488a-8123-4fe4-9002-cae891d9ed4f_1092x132.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7feb488a-8123-4fe4-9002-cae891d9ed4f_1092x132.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7feb488a-8123-4fe4-9002-cae891d9ed4f_1092x132.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>When we begin to compare some of the key metrics with other companies in the gaming industry, we start to get an idea of how well ATVI compare.</p><p>Firstly, looking at the operating margin between the 4 companies, ATVI&#8217;s sits at 35.19% for the past 12 months - more than double that of every other competitor.

This is with the context of much better top-line revenue growth, better operating margin and a less cyclical business model. </p><p>If we were to say ATVI were trading at a similar EV/EBITDA ratio to TakeTwo (28.93X) then the company would have a market cap of $94.46B and therefore a share-price of (94.46/0.77702 *777M shares outstanding*) = $121.57 which represents a potential upside of 32%.</p><p>I would guess most of the current pricing assumes that Activision Blizzard will struggle to keep up with the uptick in business from the pandemic, and therefore the relative success seen throughout 2020 will revert back to pre-pandemic norms. However, in my opinion the business has fundamentally changed - a new strategy is in place in order to focus on the popular IP and reduce the cyclical nature which will benefit them for the long-run. Adding to this, CoD Warzone is still the second most streamed game over 1 year on from its release and CoD (the overall franchise) is number 3 in most titles sold ever with 400M copied - coming in behind Tetris and Mario.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>To conclude, as Activision Blizzard continue to cement their position within the gaming industry with their valuable IP, capable management and a robust yet evolving business model. I am confident they can continue to lean into the tremendous opportunity that is &#8216;gaming&#8217; over the coming decade.</p><p>The past several years has seen the industry evolve rapidly - adopting new features and hardware (such as social gaming, e-sports and VR/AR) which has completely altered the gaming landscape. ATVI has adapted quickly to these changes, bringing in new business models for existing IP (free-to-play) and dipping their toes in completely new areas (e-sports). Both of these moves are encouraging, as it signals managements intent to bring ATVI into a new generation of gaming.</p><p>That being said, there remains several very real risks&#8230;</p><ul><li><p>The management become far too reliant on one IP (CoD)</p></li><li><p>Management too cautious with investing cash</p></li><li><p>The gaming segment doesn&#8217;t take-off like we predict</p></li><li><p>Much of the current upside over the next decade is already factored in</p></li></ul><p>However, I believe the overall future for ATVI is a bright one. The recent changes to the company have come at a perfect time - stimulating engagement and overall sales throughout the pandemic, leading to increased profitability and greater long term potential.</p><p>ATVI is a strong play on the future of gaming.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Innovestor</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Is 'moat' an overused term?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Stock Take #1]]></description><link>https://innovestor.substack.com/p/is-moat-an-overused-term</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://innovestor.substack.com/p/is-moat-an-overused-term</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Innovestor]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jun 2021 13:59:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/03b60cd8-17f4-48ac-b3d2-1af2ffaacb74_1600x900.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Today is a different style of article than the usual Innovestor deep-dive.

As, over the years, it has come to mean different things to different people.</p><p>One of the more famous explanations of the term &#8216;moat&#8217; came from Warren Buffet in his 1995 Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting. He said the following in response to a question on his opinion of the fundamental rules of economics&#8230;</p><blockquote><p><em>"What we're trying to do, is we're trying to find a business with a <strong>wide and long-lasting moat around it</strong>,<strong> protecting a terrific economic castle</strong>, with an <strong>honest lord</strong> in charge of the castle."  </em></p><p><em>What we're trying to find is a business that, for one reason or another -- it can be because it's the low-cost producer in some area, it can be because it has a <strong>natural franchise</strong> because of surface capabilities, it could be because of its <strong>position in the consumers' mind</strong>, it can be because of a <strong>technological advantage</strong>, or any kind of reason at all, that it has this moat around it."</em></p><p><em>"But we are trying to figure out what is keeping -- why is that castle still standing? And what's going to keep it standing or cause it not to be standing five, 10, 20 years from now. What are the key factors? And how permanent are they? How much do they depend on the genius of the lord in the castle?"</em></p><p><em>"And then if we feel good about the moat, then we try to figure out whether, you know, the lord is going to try to take it all for himself, whether he's likely to do something stupid with the proceeds, et cetera."</em></p></blockquote><div id="youtube2-G2k0cYDWgI0" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;G2k0cYDWgI0&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:&quot;6412&quot;,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/G2k0cYDWgI0?start=6412&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>In essence, Buffet argues that In order for a company to be successful, they must have a definite competitive advantage allowing them to maintain pricing power and better than average profit margins.</p><h2>How are Moat&#8217;s created?</h2><p>The vast majority of companies don&#8217;t have a moat when they start off. It&#8217;s often something that develops over time as the business begins to scale and the brand/product develops.</p><p>For example, when Disney first started, they had no moat. As the years went on and more intellectual property was added, the moat grew and grew. Similarly with Amazon, the moat didn&#8217;t really kick in until years down the line when they gained enough scale to dominate the e-commerce industry.</p><p>Some common examples of moats include&#8230;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Low-cost of production:</strong> Low cost of production is an advantage coming directly from scale. Amazon are the perfect example here - as the company scaled from a relatively small online retailer to one of the largest on the planet, the unit economics improved so much so that this factor alone gave them the ability to force out smaller competitors.</p></li><li><p><strong>High switching costs</strong>: More of a trait of newer technology companies, the core idea is the more difficult it is for a consumer to change to a rivals product/service, the greater the moat. </p><p>I would also argue that switching costs are less common of a moat nowadays, as advances in technology and business culture make it much easier to switch services.</p><p>These costs don&#8217;t solely come in monetary form, occasionally it is in the form of data or behaviour which will need to change. For example, if we take a look at a Spotify customer contemplating a move to Apple Music. Physically, there is no switching cost as you can simply cancel one and open the other, but the customer would sacrifice years of personalized data that manifest in tailored recommendations from the machine learning outputs Spotify provides. Switching costs have almost become &#8220;data moats&#8221;.  </p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ce4c14b-ce74-41a5-8279-f322b893b548_2000x1343.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ce4c14b-ce74-41a5-8279-f322b893b548_2000x1343.png" width="1456" height="978" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6ce4c14b-ce74-41a5-8279-f322b893b548_2000x1343.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:978,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:309190,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ce4c14b-ce74-41a5-8279-f322b893b548_2000x1343.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ce4c14b-ce74-41a5-8279-f322b893b548_2000x1343.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ce4c14b-ce74-41a5-8279-f322b893b548_2000x1343.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ce4c14b-ce74-41a5-8279-f322b893b548_2000x1343.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><ul><li><p><strong>Network effects:</strong> Relatively common. At its core &#8216;network effects&#8217; take place when users of the product/service/platform gain more value as the number of users in the ecosystem increase. This is often a symptom of a business where the product/service creates significant value for itself and others.</p><p>A good example of a company with powerful network effects includes Airbnb or Fiverr.

Examples include airports, railways, utilities and infrastructure. Each of these industries should be more beneficial with scale.</p></li></ul><p>Competitive moats take time. Unless you are geographically lucky, you will often have to spend years building value and executing at scale. Most companies will start out with no moat but will develop one of the above over time, therefore making it hard (but not impossible) for new entrants to gain market share.</p><h2>Do moats exist within tech companies?</h2><p>I would argue there are close to 0 actual moats in technology. The whole industry is created from disruption and is focused on how to disrupt the competitor. It&#8217;s a very agile industry and one that is hard to try to keep up with.</p><p>The closest thing to a moat would probably be the high switching costs present in lots of tech companies. Typically, switching your development team is expensive in time &amp; money. Also the idea of network effects in marketplace companies like Airbnb would be examples of a moat.</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;In this current wave of disruption, is it still possible to build sustainable moats? For founders, it may feel like every advantage you build can be replicated by another team down the street, or at the very least, it feels like moats can only be built at massive scale. Open source tools and cloud have pushed power to the &#8220;new incumbents,&#8217; &#8212; the current generation of companies that are at massive scale, have strong distribution networks, high switching cost, and strong brands working for them. These are companies like Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Salesforce.&#8221; </em></p></blockquote><p>Several other examples within technology:</p><ol><li><p>Facebook advertising platform - previously no moat until this was in place.</p></li><li><p>Netflix&#8217;s moat is supposedly the brand/content-library/first mover advantage.</p></li></ol><p>There is somewhat of a disconnect between traditional companies and software companies. Traditional investors would argue there is no moat in any of these SaaS businesses - they just have a really good product. </p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/StockJabber/status/1384492546345349122?s=20&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Super moat companies:\n\n1) Airports\n2) Railroads\n3) Waste management\n4) Ubiquitous software (e.g., Microsoft)\n5) Two-sided marketplaces (e.g., eBay, Etsy, Carvana)\n6) Twitter/Disney/Unique media\n7) Stock exchanges\n8) Rating agencies\n9) Utilities\n\nWhat else should be on this list?&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;StockJabber&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Edwin Dorsey&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Tue Apr 20 13:02:00 +0000 2021&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:95,&quot;like_count&quot;:772,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null}"><a href="https://twitter.com/StockJabber/status/1384492546345349122?s=20" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-user-avatar" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/twitter_name/w_36/StockJabber.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @StockJabber"><span class="tweet-author-name">Edwin Dorsey </span><span class="tweet-author">@StockJabber</span></div>Super moat companies:

There are many examples of moats aligned with consumer benefit.&#8221;</em></p></li></ol><p><strong>Elon musk</strong> - <em>&#8220;I think moats are lame&#8230;If your only defense against invading armies is a moat, you will not last long. What matters is the pace of innovation&#8211;that is the fundamental determinant of competitiveness.&#8221;</em></p><p>What I think Elon is getting at with this quote is that a competitive advantage isn&#8217;t a static thing - an advantage (or moat) you have today may not be sufficient tomorrow.</p><blockquote><p>George Stalk Jr. of BCG&nbsp;- <em>&#8220;The best competitors, the most successful ones, know how to keep moving and always stay on the cutting edge. Competition&nbsp;is so dynamic that speed&nbsp;is a critical strategic weapon.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>My generally held opinion here is that the term &#8216;moat&#8217; has been vastly overused over recent years. It seems almost every company is said to have some form of economic moat, whereas this simply isn&#8217;t true.</p><p>There are many examples of defensible business models, however with the advent of AI, Machine learning and cloud computing, traditional moats are less and less common - ushering in the next generation of software companies who operate on a completely different playing-field. Pace of innovation is likely to be a key factor in competitiveness moving forwards.</p><p>As investors, we should be careful (and less lazy) when deciding whether a company has a moat. Oftentimes the answer is no.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Innovestor</p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://innovestor.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://innovestor.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Thanks for reading this short article.

Thesis</h2><p>E-commerce is slowly but steadily becoming the norm. The past decade has seen Amazon rise to be one of the worlds most influential companies, and is one of the few that if it were to disappear tomorrow, we would most likely see a dramatic impact on the global economy. The company has slowly but surely weaved its tenticles into almost every core activity we do - entertainment, food shopping, clothes, general shopping, business operations, AWS (the list goes on).</p><p>Technology is dragging traditional retail kicking and screaming into the 21st Century. 15 years ago smart phones were only just emerging and the majority of shopping was completed in traditional bricks and mortar stores. Just 15 years and 1 global pandemic later, we can see e-commerce becoming a more ingrained part of our everyday lives.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b2a3c63-4ee1-4f34-95dc-b04f30c84c0a_574x564.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b2a3c63-4ee1-4f34-95dc-b04f30c84c0a_574x564.jpeg" width="574" height="564" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4b2a3c63-4ee1-4f34-95dc-b04f30c84c0a_574x564.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:564,&quot;width&quot;:574,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:66683,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b2a3c63-4ee1-4f34-95dc-b04f30c84c0a_574x564.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b2a3c63-4ee1-4f34-95dc-b04f30c84c0a_574x564.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b2a3c63-4ee1-4f34-95dc-b04f30c84c0a_574x564.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b2a3c63-4ee1-4f34-95dc-b04f30c84c0a_574x564.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>With that being said, MercardoLibre are looking to use the blueprints of the first movers in order to apply a similar model to Latin-America - a rapidly evolving demographic in terms of digitisation and technology adoption.</p><p>The company have been quietly executing over the past decade in order to be in with a shout of total continental domination.

The business</h2><h4>3.1. History</h4><p>The current CEO, Marcos Galperin, attended Stanford Graduate School of Business at age 26 where he came up with the idea for MercadoLibre in 1999. Soon after he had the idea, he was able to convince Stello Tolda (current COO) and Hernan Kazah to join him on the journey to create one of Latin America&#8217;s most successful e-commerce companies.</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/mercado-libre-founders-it-takes-patience-resilience">Hernan Kazah </a>- &#8220;At the time there were like 80 other companies throughout Latin America following the same business model. We may have had a great team and long-term vision. But the idea was not unique. Even our friends sometimes got confused about which business was ours.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>After years of building up MercadoLibre, expanding into new markets and raising funds - the company became the first Latin American company to be listed on the NASDAQ and to this day is Latin America&#8217;s most popular e-commerce site.</p><p>Coincidentally, on the same day, (august 9th 2007) BNP Paribis froze $2.2B in assets - signifying the start of the global financial crisis.</p><p>Compared to their major international competitors (Amazon, E-Bay, Alibaba) MercadoLibre was a relatively late-mover - 5 years later than Amazon, 4 years later than Ebay and 4 months after Alibaba. Although not first to the scene, Meli have used their lagging position in the market as an advantage, learning from the mistakes of their competitors. </p><h4>3.2. Company overview</h4><p>&#8216;What does MercadoLibre do?&#8217; is not such a simple question to answer. The company have their fingers in many different pies.</p><p>Meli aims to enable e-commerce and digital payments throughout Latin America by delivering a suite of technology solutions across the complete value chain of commerce. The company have established themselves as the largest e-commerce player in Latin America, and operates across 18 countries, with a market leading position in each of the major countries.</p><p>Latin America, which comprises of over 650M people, is also one of the fastest growing regions in terms of digital/technological adoption.

There is a lot to unpack&#8230;</p><p>As outlined by the above graphic, there are 6 main segments to the business; Libre (marketplace), Envios (logistics), Credito (credit), Shops, Mercado pago (payments) and Libre Publicidad (advertising). This combination of products and services amalgamates in a well oiled ecosystem - elevating the average person&#8217;s ability to buy, sell, create a business, and access credit&#8230; all within one system. </p><p>These elements have been the result of a slow but steady building process over the past several decades.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Libre Marketplace</strong>: </p><p>The marketplace is (and always was) the core of Meli&#8217;s business. Starting off as an eBay replica, the company operated an automated e-commerce platform allowing anyone to buy/sell goods online.</p><p>As arguably the most well established of the business segments, you would maybe expect growth to somewhat plateau. However, as technology/internet penetration continues to grow within Latin America, there is still plenty of room for growth. Advertising alone has the potential to substantially increase returns. Amazon, for example, operate mainly in the US which has an almost fully penetrated internet market, and are predicted to generate over $26B in 2021 alone.</p></li><li><p><strong>Envios (Logistics)</strong>: </p><p>Envios operates a very similar model to Amazon logistics, with a mixture of solutions - including drop-shipping, fulfillment, cross-docking &amp; flex. But at it&#8217;s core, the Enios service is a powerful tool to connect otherwise disparate locations. This is achieved through a mixture of first and third-party logistics providers.</p><p>Part of the recent strategy from management was to double-down on investments in Meli&#8217;s logistics. As a result of these investments, Meli is currently positioned as the leading logistics service within the region - this is taking into account that Envios is only available in 6 of 18 current locations.</p><ul><li><p>Over 208M items shipped</p></li><li><p>Grew over 130% y/y</p></li><li><p>Network penetration of 80%, up from 46% y/y</p></li><li><p>74% of all volume delivered in less than 48 hours</p></li><li><p>Free shipping threshold reduced</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Libre Credito</strong>: Relatively straight-forward - Libre Credito provides users of the platform access to credit (loans) at favourable rates.</p><p>The Credito service solves the regional problem of the majority of people needing access to credit in order to build and scale small businesses, however lacking access to credit. Via Credito, Meli are able to underwrite customers who would otherwise not be eligible for credit.</p><p>The direct effect of this is an increase in small businesses selling on the platform, which leads to an increase in products&#8230; therefore fueling the fly-wheel.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62d51063-79a6-487e-8f64-6a5c9f06d990_1386x733.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62d51063-79a6-487e-8f64-6a5c9f06d990_1386x733.jpeg" width="1386" height="733" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/62d51063-79a6-487e-8f64-6a5c9f06d990_1386x733.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:733,&quot;width&quot;:1386,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:110601,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62d51063-79a6-487e-8f64-6a5c9f06d990_1386x733.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62d51063-79a6-487e-8f64-6a5c9f06d990_1386x733.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62d51063-79a6-487e-8f64-6a5c9f06d990_1386x733.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62d51063-79a6-487e-8f64-6a5c9f06d990_1386x733.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The company are also starting to offer credit for buyers, given the low penetration of credit card holders in LatinAmerica. This has allowed normal people to buy higher-ticket items - thereby increasing the attractiveness of becoming a seller on the platform.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Mercado Shops</strong>: </p><p>A similar idea to that of Shopify - the &#8216;Shops&#8217; division enables a user to set up an online store, with the benefit of having access to other valuable ecosystem assets such as traffic from marketplaces and easy integration with payment solutions. </p></li><li><p><strong>Libre Publicidad (Advertising)</strong>: Enables businesses to promote their products and services on the Internet through MercadoLibre. As mentioned earlier - the potential to grow the online advertising business as more and more people use the platform is a huge revenue opportunity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mercado Pago (Payment solution):&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Akin to Paypal or Square. Over the past several years Meli has introduced an integrated payment system, allowing Latin America to move away from cash. The payment business is getting really big, really fast.</p><p>Originally, Mercado Pago started out as a service where you could deposit cash, transfer to credit, then use it in a card form. The popularity of this service, combined with the introduction to third parties/bricks &amp; mortar retailers saw an explosion in usage and uptake. Meli had stumbled onto a potentially huge growth lever.</p><ul><li><p>Total Payment Volume reached almost $15B, growing 129% y/y</p></li><li><p>Reached a total of 630M transactions for Q1, growth of 117% y/y</p></li></ul><p>Under this business segment, Meli operate several different financial service products - credit, Point of Sale systems (similar to Square readers), pre-paid cards, digital wallets, merchant services, and investment accounts (Mercado Fondo).</p><p>Mirroring the company&#8217;s overall strategy/ethos, the sheer variety of payment services shows their intention - to create an ecosystem where the added value of the combination of services is unmatched. This desire to create a comprehensive financial system stems from the inherent lack of banking infrastructure in the region. </p><p>4% of the US and 1% of the UK are unbanked - compared to 63% of Mexio and 54% of Argentina.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><h4>3.4. Management</h4><p>One of the standout aspects in the story of MercadoLibre is the competence of the management team, spearheaded by the CEO - Marcos Galperin. Beneath Galperin we have Dan Rabinovich (COO), followed by a handful of &#8216;Presidents&#8217; and Vice-Presidents&#8217; who are essentially CEO&#8217;s of the various departments within their own right.</p><p>From various interviews over the years, a picture emerges of a passionate and highly competent CEO in Galperin - who has managed to slowly curate a team of highly effective executives across a range of different domains.  </p><ul><li><p>Pedro Arnt - CFO</p></li><li><p>Osvaldo Giminez - President of Fintech</p></li><li><p>Martin de los Santos - Vice President of Finance</p></li><li><p>Stelleo Pasos Tolda - President of Commerce</p></li><li><p>Ariel Szarfsztejn - COO of Mercado Envios</p></li></ul><p>2 examples of management&#8217;s effectiveness&#8230;</p><h5>Overcoming obstacles </h5><p>Over the past decade, Galperin had a vision of improving the logistics infrastructure within Latin America - and to achieve this he started Mercado Envios in 2013. Over the following years the company invested large sums of money into the venture. By the latter half of the decade, MercadoLibre&#8217;s infrastructure system spanned to Brazil, opening up completely new (very large) markets.</p><p>However, in 2018, Brazil&#8217;s national postal service raised it&#8217;s prices - resulting a huge blow for the company.</p><p>Instead of backing off when finances were under severe pressure, Galperin decided to invest more and more money into MercadoLibre&#8217;s infrastructure system - expanding fulfillment and free-shipping capacity within the reigon.</p><p>This risk paid off. By 2019, Mercado Envios (the logistical arm of MercadoLibre) were handling over 80M packages per quarter across six countries. MercadoLibre were fully established as the core logistics within the region. </p><p>This upfront investment into the business will likely prove to be a deciding factor in the future success of the company.</p><h5><strong>Knowing the market</strong></h5><p>A question you may be asking yourself is &#8220;why can&#8217;t another global e-commerce player get involved within the Latin American market? The opportunity it offers is so great - why would someone like Amazon ignore it?&#8221;</p><p>One of the answers is the fact that management have a good understanding of the intricacies of operating within the Latin American Market. Galperin and his team decided early on to adopt the structure of different teams for different geographies. This allowed the company to be more agile in responding to differences within the regions - adapting product-market fit to the local circumstances. Other companies, like Amazon, adopted more of a &#8216;top-down&#8217; approach. Which has seemingly been less effective.  </p><h2>4. Market opportunity</h2><p>This graph, from <a href="https://investor.mercadolibre.com/static-files/c9c7e0d2-ec16-45b2-bf0b-0630e944c0b7">the company&#8217;s 2018 business overview slides</a>, is a great way to visualize the potential for Latin America to grow into their position within the overall market. There is evidently still a long runway ahead.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fffe774ed-d90b-4e0f-bb67-f44eba94e51e_1043x533.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fffe774ed-d90b-4e0f-bb67-f44eba94e51e_1043x533.jpeg" width="1043" height="533" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ffe774ed-d90b-4e0f-bb67-f44eba94e51e_1043x533.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:533,&quot;width&quot;:1043,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:39894,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fffe774ed-d90b-4e0f-bb67-f44eba94e51e_1043x533.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fffe774ed-d90b-4e0f-bb67-f44eba94e51e_1043x533.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fffe774ed-d90b-4e0f-bb67-f44eba94e51e_1043x533.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fffe774ed-d90b-4e0f-bb67-f44eba94e51e_1043x533.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Covid was a large factor in the uptick in online e-commerce sales. <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1116604/change-e-commerce-revenue-coronavirus-latin-america/">From Statista:</a> &#8220;<em>In the week starting April 6, 2020, e-commerce revenue in Peru increased ten times (that is 900 percent) compared to the week starting March 9th In Latin America.

Both opportunities are young in terms of runway, with so much of the market left to penetrate. </p><p>For me, the really exciting area of development for MercadoLibre is Mercado Pago, as it represents possibly the greatest opportunity in getting the majority of Latin America involved in the financial system as well as the Meli flywheel.</p><h2>5. Competition</h2><p>As the reigon has developed, more and more foreign players are looking to get a slice of the action.</p><p>Amazon initially entered into the region in 2012, Alibaba in 2015 and Shopee (SEA) look to be the most recent entrants. Competition is hotting up - and it&#8217;s a real question of whether Meli can survive against substantially deeper pockets.</p><p>Taking a brief look at Shopee (one of the 5 main arms of Sea Ltd)  - it is<strong> &#8220;</strong><em>Sea&#8217;s e-commerce platform and is the leading e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia and Taiwan by gross merchandise volume. Unlike the developed markets, the internet economies in Southeast Asia are still expanding rapidly and Shopee is on track to acquire a significant share of this expansion. Shopee also has footprints in Latin America including Brazil and Mexico. Shopee provides consumers an&nbsp;easy, secure, fast, and enjoyable online shopping experience that is enjoyed by tens of millions of consumers daily.</em>&#8221; - <a href="https://www.wolfofharcourtstreet.com/p/sea-limited-investment-thesis">Wolf of Harcourt Sea investment Thesis</a></p><p>The Asian company have a slightly different overall strategy than Meli. They aim to get customers onto the platform via the popular games divition - Garena. </p><p>For example, their most popular mobile Battle Royal game, Free Fire, is a great way to get users involved within the ecosystem. Not only is gaming an important aspect of getting users on-board, the addictive social features surrounding the games encourage users to open and play the apps multiple times per day. There are plenty more strategic routes in order to get people involved and using the platform that Meli simply don&#8217;t possess.</p><p>Worringly for MercadoLibre, Shopee&#8217;s strategy seems to be working. The Shopee app is the <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/apps/top/google/app-index/br/all/top-free/">6th most downloaded app</a> on the google play store in Brazil.</p><p>Amazon, Alibaba, Americanas and OLX are all also serious players in the e-commerce industry. For example, <a href="https://www.aircargonews.net/airlines/alibaba-targets-south-america-e-commerce-with-atlas-air-deal/">Alibaba have made a deal with Atlas Air</a> in order to improve their logistical infrastructure within Latin America. </p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;The move comes as Cainiao (Alibaba&#8217;s logistics company) has seen its parcel volumes to South America take off this year; in the third quarter of 2020 it transported more than 8m packages, double the number transported during the second quarter of this year.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><p>As for Amazon, late last year the company announced plans to open its biggest distribution center yet in Brazil. Whilst at the same time opening 2,000 jobs in Colombia - mainly in customer service.&nbsp;And in Mexico, the company have kicked-off another payment option that makes it even easier for users to complete purchases using cash.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, even though competition within the reigon is heating up, I think Meli will welcome it. Part of the company&#8217;s strategy over the past decade has been to learn from the mistakes and successes of the first movers. Keeping a low profile whilst executing on targets will be key to the company&#8217;s future success.</p><h5>Are Meli safe from Amazon?</h5><p>No one company is really safe from Amazon (with the one exception of Alibaba). Any business in almost any market has a risk of Amazon finding a way to price-match and therefore drive down margins.</p><p>That being said, Meli acts as more of a Paypal/Amazon hybrid. With a large amount of Meli merchants running bank accounts within the platform - the ecosystem is sticky. It would take a extraordinarily large push from Amazon to somehow untangle the existing network effects.</p><h2>6. Bull case</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Competent management</strong></p></li></ol><p>MercadoLibre are founder-led. </p><p>Galperin, one of the co-founders over 20 years ago, is still at the helm and has been one of the main driving factors of growth at Meli. So much of what we see today - the logistics network, the payment network - is mainly a vision from Galperin. He is someone who saw e-commerce and digital payments early and capitalized (and more importantly executed) on the opportunity.</p><p><em>&#8220;Galperin trust disclosed <strong>ownership</strong>&nbsp;of 3,900,000&nbsp;<strong>shares</strong>&nbsp;of Mercadolibre Inc (US:MELI). This represents 7.8 percent&nbsp;<strong>ownership</strong>&nbsp;of the company.&#8221;</em></p><ol start="2"><li><p><strong>Evolving e-comm and Digi Payments industries</strong></p></li></ol><p>As discussed in one of the sections above, MercadoLibre are capitalizing on the underlying opportunity of the adoption of both e-commerce and digital payments within Latin America.</p><p>With a region double the size of North America and with a much reduced level of internet and digital wallet penetration, MercadoLibre are in the perfect position to capitalize on the rapidly growing e-commerce industry.

The company started as an e-Bay replica but quickly added many different strings to their bow in the form of Mercado Envios, Pago, Fondo, Credito, Shops and Publicidad among others - creating a sticky ecosystem of banking, logistics and commerce.</p><ol start="6"><li><p><strong>Focus on growth</strong></p></li></ol><p>Again, this is a testament to the management team and their willingness to take risks at a time when the company is under financial pressure. The executive team are aware this is a long game, and therefore need to focus on building a robust infrastructure - thereby forgoing short term profits for the long term domination of the Latin American market.</p><ol start="7"><li><p><strong>Strong Network effects</strong></p></li></ol><p>Part of the beauty of the MercadoLibre ecosystem is the intertwined nature of each of the different components. At first glance it looks complex, however the model makes logical sense. And once you are within the flywheel, the benefits are obvious. Put simply, the more merchants Meli can get to sell on the platform increases the level of buyers, which then increases the desire to be a merchant - and the flywheel continues.  </p><ol start="8"><li><p><strong>Robust growth &amp; emerging profits</strong></p></li></ol><p>Unique active users grew by 78% in 2020 to reach a total of 132.5M, up from 74.2M in 2019. The first quarter of 2021 has already seen unique active users increase by 69.8M in the three months ending March (representing 52% of the total unique active users).</p><p>The company&#8217;s annual revenue expanded by over 6 times from $651.8 million in 2015 to $3.97B in 2020. However, due to large investments in infrastructure and S&amp;M costs, MercadoLibre hasn't been profitable over recent years. Net loss in 2020 was 0.7M, down from a net loss of 172M in 2019.</p><p>2021 earnings are expected to more than double, even as revenue growth slows.</p><h2>7. Bear Case</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Economic and political risks</strong></p></li></ol><p>One important thing to remember here is that we are dealing with Latin America as a whole, which brings with it a myriad of issues. Just looking at the past several years we have seen political scandals, hyperinflation and corruption, just to name a few. These are generally considered the associated set of risks when operating within emerging markets.</p><ol start="2"><li><p><strong>Currency fluctuations</strong></p></li></ol><p>Foreign exchange rates can have a huge impact on MercadoLibre&#8217;s operations. Due to the Securities and Exchange Commission rules, Meli have to use the foreign currency rates and translate those to dollars for the financial reports.</p><p>Two examples:</p><ul><li><p>Over the past 5 years the Argentine Peso has devalued rapidly against the USD.</p></li><li><p>In 2017, Meli had to exit Venezuela due to the country defaulting on its government bonds.</p></li></ul><div

On a TTM (Trailing Twelve Months) basis revenue has increased by 90% in one year, from $2.475B to $4.7B. And looking that on a quarterly basis, net revenues for Q1 were $1.4 B, a year-over-year increase of 111.4% in USD and 158.4% on an FX neutral basis.

Conclusion</h2><p>To conclude, as a company started by two guys at Stanford business school over 20 years ago, it would have been difficult to imagine the scale and complexity with which MercadoLibre operates today. In the process of building an e-bay replica for Latin America, the team at Meli have created an ecosystem that enables Latin America to take a leap forward with regards to economic empowerment.</p><p>MercadoLibre are set to be the primary beneficiary of the global trend towards internet adoption and therefore e-commerce. Latin America are currently about 10 years behind the U.S. with regards to these factors, so have plenty of runway to grow.</p><p>All of this is not without risk (and nor should it be). Political, economic and geographical issues, along with the introduction of powerful competition, raises significant question-marks over MercadoLibre&#8217;s ability to succeed - not just as a business, but as a stock. However, I believe Meli are best placed to dominate in the Latin American market and will be able to keep up their track-record of exceptional execution.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Innovestor</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Roku deep-dive]]></title><description><![CDATA[The most important piece to the streaming puzzle?]]></description><link>https://innovestor.substack.com/p/roku-deep-dive</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://innovestor.substack.com/p/roku-deep-dive</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Innovestor]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 21 May 2021 11:30:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/345d4490-a3d7-4bd8-ab50-4796cb2efb81_712x400.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Welcome to the&nbsp;<strong>71 new readers</strong>&nbsp;who have joined us since the last article!

With this, advertising dollars will need to be re-directed towards CTV. If Roku can establish themselves as the new &#8216;go-to&#8217; TV operating system, then they will be able to attract the lions-share of traditional TV advertising dollars.</p><p>Since 2019, 1 in every 3 Smart TV&#8217;s sold in the US were Roku operating systems, making Roku the No.1 OS for smart TV&#8217;s in the US. Alongside this, Roku logged over 18.3 billion streaming hours last quarter - an increase of 1.4 billion since the previous quarter. </p><p>Due to the leading position with regards to both ad-tech and market share, I believe Roku are perfectly poised to take advantage of the opportunity.</p><h2>2.

It also can be recorded via DVR and watched later. Linear TV still boasts the largest market, however, reach is fragmenting due to the increasingly competitive streaming landscape.</p></blockquote><h2>4. Business overview</h2><p>Roku originally rose to popularity as a connected television device - helping pioneer the ability to stream apps like Netflix and HULU on your &#8216;not-so-smart&#8217; TV. </p><p>As the years have gone by and as technology has developed, Roku have transitioned towards more of an advertising model as opposed to selling individual pieces of hardware (which they still do).</p><p>The Roku devices are sold mainly in the US &amp; Canada, although have been expanding internationally over the past several years - reaching new territories such as Brazil.</p><p>The company are big believers in ad-supported tv, which they see as an under-served part of the market from a consumers point of view. Everyone knows people come over to streaming primarily to be able to watch what they want when they want. However what most don&#8217;t realize is the second most common reason for the switch - which is to save money from over-inflated cable bills. Roku recognized a large chunk of consumers would be willing to watch ad-supported TV as long as the ad experience isn't too painful and the content is good. The fundamental business model is built on this assumption.</p><h4>4.1. Strategy</h4><p>The strategy here can be simplified into several simple aspects.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Gain high market penetration by selling connected TV hardware at a low margin.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Develop a high quality advertising platform using big-data.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Attract advertising dollars from the fall-off from linear TV.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Maximize Advertising efficiency.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Profit</strong></p></li></ol><p>Lets break that down&#8230;</p><p>The overarching goal here is to create a platform where Roku are the number one Connected TV operating system in the world - enabling the connection between the entire TV ecosystem. It will be a one-stop-shop for all your TV needs. This serves as a win win for both ROKU and the SVOD channels like Netflix and Hulu etc. as Roku provides these services with a large audience whilst these services increase the volume and quality of data Roku use to serve ads, thereby increasing the quality of ads.</p><p>For this to happen, Roku&#8217;s hardware needs to be simple, effective and bug-free. As someone without a Roku TV, this isn&#8217;t something I can speak to directly - however after trawling through the reviews &amp; comments it seems like this statements holds true for the most part.</p><h5><strong>1) Gain higher market penetration: </strong></h5><p>In order to capture a greater market share Roku need to keep increasing the number of active accounts. </p><p>To achieve this, the company sells hardware such streaming players, accessories and TV&#8217;s with Roku built-in. Alongside this, Roku work with hardware brands who licence the operating system in order to manufacture and sell Roku-based TV models.</p><p>The important aspect here is being able to get these connected TV devices and software to as many people as possible - therefore the margin on this aspect of the business is low in comparison to the platform aspect <strong>(13.8% compared to 66.9% in the most recent quarter)</strong>. These margins have remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease in platform growth revenue over the course of several years.</p><h5><strong>2) Develop a high quality advertising platform: </strong></h5><p>One of the ways to achieve this is to fuel the Roku fly-wheel.

As a result of this, the increasing demand coming over on the advertising side diverts more money back into spending on content, which results in higher quality ads (due to more data)... And the flywheel repeats.</p><h5><strong>3) Attract advertising dollars from the cord cutting trend: </strong></h5><p>There is strong evidence to indicate that traditional TV ad revenue is shifting towards connected TV.</p><p>A quote from a recent article from <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2021/01/21/netflix-and-roku-stock-the-crucial-difference/?sh=403c67ab7c38">Beth Kindig</a>&#8230;</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;About <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/us-connected-tv-advertising-2020">$10 billion</a> has been spent on Connected TV ads compared to <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/us-tv-ad-spend-will-decrease-by-15-percent-in-2020">$70 billion</a> on pay television ads in the United States alone. Pay-TV ad spend is now expected to decline by 15% to $60 billion this year due to the postponement of live sports and also due to an increase in cord-cutting from covid.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><p>As the Roku operating system is currently the number 1 operating system in the US - I believe the company are best placed to capitalize on this opportunity.</p><h5><strong>4) Maximize advertising efficiency: </strong></h5><p>ARPU (average revenue per user) is a good metric for the efficiency with which Roku are able to monetize their audience. As you can see from the image below, ARPU has been increasing rapidly over the past year, with a 32% y/y increase from Q1 2020.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9abeb72b-eee5-4e0f-aace-5804721b5ad5_750x75.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9abeb72b-eee5-4e0f-aace-5804721b5ad5_750x75.png" width="750" height="75" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9abeb72b-eee5-4e0f-aace-5804721b5ad5_750x75.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:75,&quot;width&quot;:750,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:24590,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9abeb72b-eee5-4e0f-aace-5804721b5ad5_750x75.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9abeb72b-eee5-4e0f-aace-5804721b5ad5_750x75.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9abeb72b-eee5-4e0f-aace-5804721b5ad5_750x75.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9abeb72b-eee5-4e0f-aace-5804721b5ad5_750x75.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The steady increase in active hours, Streaming hours &amp; ARPU is good evidence that the fly-wheel effect is indeed working. With more users on board, more data can be collected about user habits - therefore increasing advertising efficiency over time.</p><h4>4.2. Revenue streams</h4><p>The core of Roku&#8217;s revenue is centered around three main pillars - Advertising, The Roku Channel and Premium Features - all of which come under &#8216;platform revenues&#8217;.</p><p><strong>Advertising: </strong>Advertising is the core of the business. Advertisers pay to have their content displayed on the Roku channel, which they are seeing as a way to engage customers more efficiently. Roku&#8217;s growing user base of over 53.6 million users has been a catalyst with this. In addition, Rokus average revenue per user (ARPU) is around $32.14 (up 32% y/y).</p><p><strong>The Roku Channel</strong>: This is a specific channel Roku owns/curates and one of the only places where the company are able to show ads. The Roku channel helps with content discovery, which feeds into advertising dollars and keeps customers coming back to the platform. Roku help you discover new content, similar to YouTube or Spotify.</p><p><strong>Premium features</strong>: This includes movie rentals and subscription based services. Roku Pay is integrated into the system in order to make the purchasing experience much more streamlined - reducing friction.</p><p>Roku is also a hardware company. In the financials, revenue is broken down into two main categories - <strong>Platform Revenue</strong> and <strong>Player Revenue </strong>(hardware). </p><p>As you can see from the below chart, the platform revenues overtook player revenues in 2018 and have been pulling away ever since. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F423a17d9-e951-4fb3-80d1-3b27448a760c_875x530.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F423a17d9-e951-4fb3-80d1-3b27448a760c_875x530.jpeg" width="678" height="410.6742857142857" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/423a17d9-e951-4fb3-80d1-3b27448a760c_875x530.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:530,&quot;width&quot;:875,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:678,&quot;bytes&quot;:60348,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F423a17d9-e951-4fb3-80d1-3b27448a760c_875x530.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F423a17d9-e951-4fb3-80d1-3b27448a760c_875x530.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F423a17d9-e951-4fb3-80d1-3b27448a760c_875x530.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F423a17d9-e951-4fb3-80d1-3b27448a760c_875x530.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><strong>Platform revenue</strong> consists of advertising, content distribution, subscription and transaction revenue shares, premium subscriptions, billing services, branded channel buttons and licensing arrangements. </p><p><strong>Player revenue</strong> consists of hardware, embedded software and unspecified upgrades on a &#8216;when and if-available&#8217; basis. This section makes up roughly 26% of TTM (trailing-twelve-month) total revenues - and has been steadily falling in each of the past 4 quarters, from 45% of total rev in Q2 2020 to 23% of total rev in Q1 2021. This decrease in revenue share signals at Roku&#8217;s core intentions to be a dominant player in the ad space. Other factors such as logistical issues (suez canal/chip shortages) and the fact that Roku are going for high-penetration of devices so selling at low margins are also key drivers of the increasing gap. </p><h4>4.3. Hardware</h4><p>I won&#8217;t spend much time on the hardware available, <a href="http://www.roku.com">as it&#8217;s all easily accessible on their site</a>. </p><p>As mentioned above, Roku originally started by selling devices you can plug into your TV in order to access SVOD services like Netflix/HULU/Amazon Prime etc.</p><p>They have a stream bar as well as the Roku boxes that they are known for. These are plug and play devices that allow anyone to bring streaming into their homes. Even when comparing the Roku OS to integrated solutions like the ones found on newer televisions, Roku seems to have an edge in that the experience is more fluid, and the channel options are constantly expanding.

And because of that, my exposure to Roku products is limited. As you can see above, the company have only just released their first integrated television into the UK market. I expect to see much more of Roku over the coming years.</p><h2>5. Advertising</h2><ul><li><p>In March, linear TV ratings for adults 18 to 24 was down 22%. Q1 TV ad spending was down 11%, according to MediaRadar. Meanwhile, <strong>Roku doubled monetized video ad impressions on the platform.</strong>  </p></li><li><p>Ad spending by major agency holding companies with Roku more than doubled.</p></li><li><p>Americans on an average day will spend more time on TV streaming than all major social media platforms combined: 3x Facebook, 2x YouTube, and roughly 2.5x Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat combined.  </p></li></ul><p>Advertising in general has taken some heat over the recent years with companies like Facebook and Google testing the limits with respect to personal data and using that data to sell ad-space. Many folks are looking for alternatives.</p><p>Other social media outlets such as Snapchat and Pinterest have majorly benefitted from the rotation away from the big boys of tech. I believe as advertisers continue to rotate ad dollars, testing different mediums, Roku will benefit.</p><p>The direct nature of Roku&#8217;s relationship with advertisers along with the targeting accuracy of Roku&#8217;s ad platform results in a satisfied client. The ability to measure the effectiveness of the ads along with the ROI is another key plus point. In addition to this, it is safe to say that as traditional TV advertisers see the benefits from a more efficient ad model, Roku&#8217;s services will be in greater demand.  </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9484bfd6-1b92-49d7-8cd0-f834367303cc_1534x898.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9484bfd6-1b92-49d7-8cd0-f834367303cc_1534x898.jpeg" width="1456" height="852" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9484bfd6-1b92-49d7-8cd0-f834367303cc_1534x898.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:852,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:205756,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9484bfd6-1b92-49d7-8cd0-f834367303cc_1534x898.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9484bfd6-1b92-49d7-8cd0-f834367303cc_1534x898.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9484bfd6-1b92-49d7-8cd0-f834367303cc_1534x898.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9484bfd6-1b92-49d7-8cd0-f834367303cc_1534x898.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>As I have mentioned several times above, advertising is a core aspect to the business-model for Roku. It&#8217;s safe to say the ad side of the business has gone somewhat under-the-radar over the past few years. However, it has simultaneously been the fastest growing aspect as of late.</p><p>User account growth has been accelerating, and with that, hours of streaming has been increasing at a similar rate. Billions of hours watched every quarter results in more engagement, which results in more ads served.</p><h4>5.1. Acquisition of DataXu</h4><p>The deal thesis when Roku acquired DataXu in late 2019 was that there was a significant advantage to roku &amp; advertisers in combining capabilities from a winning DSP platform (reach &amp; self service programming capabilities) with Roku's broad-scale reach, first party relationship with largest streaming audience out there, and all proprietary data that comes from that. </p><blockquote><p><strong>DSP - </strong>A demand-side platform is a piece of software used to purchase&nbsp;<strong>advertising</strong>&nbsp;in an automated fashion.&nbsp;<strong>DSPs</strong>&nbsp;are most often used by&nbsp;<strong>advertisers</strong>&nbsp;and agencies to help them buy display, video, mobile and search&nbsp;<strong>ads.</strong></p></blockquote><h4>5.2. OneView</h4><p>Roku&#8217;s OneView is the self-serve option for marketers who would like to purchase ads on Roku and integrate all of Roku&#8217;s data available for marketers in order to use at their disposal. Previously Roku acquired Dataxu DSP (demand side platform) and integrated it into OneView, allowing OneView to be even more efficient at obtaining and filtering the data marketers want.</p><p>The Oneview ad platform side of things is basically tripling whilst the overall ad business is growing very fast. </p><ul><li><p><strong>Roku monetizable video ad impressions more than doubled y/y.</strong></p></li><li><p>Y<strong>ou can reach an estimated four in five persons in the US</strong> using Roku&#8217;s OneView platform.</p></li><li><p><strong>Consumers now spend more time streaming than they do those other three touch points combined.</strong></p></li></ul><p>As consumers move to streaming and all TV advertising is streamed, advertisers are looking for a tool-set to scale their OTT advertising. They want self serve capabilities to optimize and to measure performance. Roku provides this.</p><h4>5.3. Nielsen</h4><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;In April, we completed the acquisition of Nielsen&#8217;s video automatic content recognition (ACR) and dynamic ad insertion (DAI) team and technologies, which will accelerate our launch of an end-to-end linear ad replacement solution in partnership with programmers.&#8221; </em></p></blockquote><p>This will be huge for ROKU as they will be able to integrate the Nielsen "always on" digital ad ratings into the OneView platform for marketers.</p><h2>6. Bull Case</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Roku is an advertising play rather than streaming play.</strong></p></li></ol><p>As an advertising play on the CTV/OTT market, Roku are unique.</p><p>As of Q3 2020, 49% of all programmatic OTT/CTV ads went to Roku.

The benefit of being a neutral middle-man enables Roku outplay their competitors as content providers with their own devices like Google, Amazon, and Apple are always going to have difficulty in negotiating with competitors to support their devices.</p><p>It would take a huge player to come in as a "neutral" competitor to unseat Roku from this position.</p><ol start="5"><li><p><strong>Revenue growth is expected to continue.</strong></p></li></ol><p>Y/Y revenue growth hasn&#8217;t dipped below 48% over the past 3 years and in some ways looks to be ramping up from here.</p><p>Some proportion of the growth in Active Accounts, Streaming Hours, and ARPU is down to the Covid working from home situation.

If we compare ARPU between the two companies, Roku is steaming ahead with $32.14 compared to Netflix&#8217;s Average Revenue per Membership of $10.73. Roku achieves this through a mix of advertising options that maintain a non-invasive experience for the customer while providing significant value to the advertiser.</p><p>Reed Hastings hinted at this in January when he mentioned that Netflix will not monetize its users any further by offering advertising options because it would be too difficult to compete with the big players in advertisement (Google/Amazon/Facebook/Roku). </p><ol start="7"><li><p><strong>Planning to add more content to the Roku Channel.</strong></p></li></ol><p>Roku is constantly adding new content to the Roku channel.

Roku saves consumers a lot of money.</p><p>Whereas if you compare to the UK - the cost to watch television is generally inexpensive due to affordable and high-quality public broadcasters. Therefore the &#8216;need&#8217; for something like Roku is reduced.</p><p>That being said, Roku's playbook of driving scale, driving engagement, then working on monetization once you've got enough scale is porting nicely to international markets.</p><p>Only 1 year ago Roku entered their first integrated TV into the UK. Ramping up ad monetization. Free ad supported TV is going to be a core experience.</p><ol start="2"><li><p><strong>How can they deliver more ads outside of the Roku Channel?</strong></p></li></ol><p>Roku are unique in that they are the closest thing to being a neutral content-provider within a competitive playing field, however - as they attempt to increase the level with which they monetize that channel, the more likely it is that content providers move to alternative streams of revenue.</p><p>The underlying concept of serving ads in a non-invasive way is certainly there, however Roku need to figure out a way to deliver more advertising whilst using the 3rd party apps like Netflix etc.</p><p>First mover advantage here is strong, but diversified revenue streams are relatively weak.</p><ol start="3"><li><p><strong>Connected TV is a commodity business, therefore has no significant competitive advantage.</strong></p></li></ol><p>Roku is much more than a connected TV device hardware company - they are an advertising platform. The whole point is you will be able to reach a wide audience and monetize those audiences through ADs. It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s you TV, laptop, phone, set top box - Roku is aiming to become the operating system of streaming.</p><ol start="4"><li><p><strong>Big tech will be able to enter their devices into the market for a lesser price and compete directly with ROKU. This will drive down margins, making Roku obsolete.</strong></p></li></ol><p>Roku are already selling hardware at next to nothing and letting it impact their margins and they're doing that in order <strong>to become </strong>as ubiquitous as possible while the window is open.</p><p>Ad Video on Demand is a very new and emerging market. We can see this by the portion of traditional TV advertising dollars that are yet to move over. </p><p>So yes, the big tech companies like Google and Amazon are competing with Roku at the moment - in a very &#8216;head-to-head&#8217; full on way. The fact that Roku have managed to remain in their number one position shows the strength of the business/brand.</p><ol start="5"><li><p><strong>What is Roku? (UK)</strong></p></li></ol><p>I live in the UK, and part of the reason I was skeptical coming into this is the lack of Roku brand visibility over here. I think this one somewhat comes down to the difference in existing television infrastructure within the UK compared to the US. Within the UK, we have free public broadcasters with a relatively inexpensive (or free) charge.</p><p>The US has much more of a need for Roku products, so it makes sense for the US to be the initial market. </p><ol start="6"><li><p><strong>Good product but no moat.</strong></p></li></ol><p>As mentioned before, the real moat here is the fact that Roku will be the No.1 operating system for connected TV. It may not sound like the strongest moat, and arguably it&#8217;s not actually a moat, however Roku are in the best position to be able to make this happen. </p><ol start="7"><li><p><strong>Competition</strong></p></li></ol><p>Even though Roku doesn&#8217;t have a large, or particularly threatening, group of competitors right now - it is extremely likely new players will enter the market as SVOD becomes mainstream. Attempts have been made with the Amazon Firestick (although relatively unsuccessfully), however as the market continues to develop we will almost certainly see more competitors attempt to grab a slice of the pie.</p><p>My prediction is that TV manufacturers will eventually settle on a standard operating system across the range of different TV&#8217;s. It&#8217;s entirely possible there will be 2 or 3 major operating systems - akin to Apple vs Android.</p><p>One recent development that highlighted the increased competition in the market was the Youtube distribution fight.</p><p>This was perceived as different than standard content dispute. Usually you would have a content publisher and a distributor, which results in different economic terms with a different viewpoint. Mutually agreeable economic terms is usually do-able.</p><p>This was not the case here. Roku were allegedly not asking for any different economics in relation to ad supported TV. Google was asking for unreasonable actions (e.g. to provide data that Roku don't provide others - biased and unbiased search results - looking to create requirements which would greatly increase the cost of the Roku players). These conditions were argues to be anti-competitive.</p><p>YouTube TV are actually still on the platform, however they have been made 'private', meaning people who had existing YouTube TV subs could still use it, but you can&#8217;t sign up to a new subscription.</p><h2>8.

This is mainly due to the company&#8217;s strategy of investing heavily in expansion. However, 2020 was close to being a profitable year, with $17M in losses and two profitable quarters in Q3 &amp; Q4.</p><p>I can see Roku posting a profitable year in 2021. And it&#8217;s off to a good start, with $76.3M in net income - far and above the -$54.6M loss from Q1 2019. Historically the first two quarters are the poorest performing quarters, with sales picking up in the latter half of the year. For the second quarter, Roku issued guidance of net revenue between $610 million and $620 million and net income of $10 million-$20 million, indicating a positive year ahead for the Connected TV giant.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Steve Louden (CFO)</strong><em> &#8220;We anticipate revenue growth rates in the second half of 2021 will be robust, but at a slower rate than the first half. For the full year, we expect overall gross margins to be in the high 40% range. We anticipate that Platform gross margin will be similar to 2020 levels, as we expect the outperformance of content distribution to normalize in Q2 and in the back half of the year. Looking ahead at the Player business, as a reminder, we do not optimize for Player gross profit, but rather account growth&#8221;.</em></p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb5521aa-1d83-44a6-a1b6-db99d6f842f7_856x508.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb5521aa-1d83-44a6-a1b6-db99d6f842f7_856x508.jpeg" width="856" height="508" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fb5521aa-1d83-44a6-a1b6-db99d6f842f7_856x508.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:508,&quot;width&quot;:856,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:51453,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb5521aa-1d83-44a6-a1b6-db99d6f842f7_856x508.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb5521aa-1d83-44a6-a1b6-db99d6f842f7_856x508.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb5521aa-1d83-44a6-a1b6-db99d6f842f7_856x508.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb5521aa-1d83-44a6-a1b6-db99d6f842f7_856x508.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Covid has definitely been a factor in the past year&#8217;s positive operating results, resulting in more demand towards Roku - leading to higher margins.</p><p>As we mentioned earlier (3.2.), the revenue is split into two sub-categories - platform revenue and player revenue. Platform revenue commands the majority of the focus for Roku as this is where the higher-margin business lies.

The split is currently 71% platform to 29% player.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0120f238-82b6-4362-bf08-840ee4321f22_648x364.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0120f238-82b6-4362-bf08-840ee4321f22_648x364.jpeg" width="648" height="364" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0120f238-82b6-4362-bf08-840ee4321f22_648x364.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:364,&quot;width&quot;:648,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:34163,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0120f238-82b6-4362-bf08-840ee4321f22_648x364.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0120f238-82b6-4362-bf08-840ee4321f22_648x364.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0120f238-82b6-4362-bf08-840ee4321f22_648x364.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0120f238-82b6-4362-bf08-840ee4321f22_648x364.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>So, taking into account that the platform revenues are increasing as an overall percentage of revenues, combined with the fact that platform revenues are the higher margin revenue stream (66.9% compared to 13.8%), we can expect the overall gross margin to increase over the coming years.</p><p>That being said, player margins are relatively unpredictable due to changing short-term factors, and platform margins have been reducing over the past couple of years which is a potential concern (~75% in 2017 to ~62% in the past 12 months).</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F747b3b0e-8a2e-45df-8eeb-2ff7c704221b_736x120.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F747b3b0e-8a2e-45df-8eeb-2ff7c704221b_736x120.png" width="736" height="120" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/747b3b0e-8a2e-45df-8eeb-2ff7c704221b_736x120.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:120,&quot;width&quot;:736,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:42580,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F747b3b0e-8a2e-45df-8eeb-2ff7c704221b_736x120.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F747b3b0e-8a2e-45df-8eeb-2ff7c704221b_736x120.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F747b3b0e-8a2e-45df-8eeb-2ff7c704221b_736x120.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F747b3b0e-8a2e-45df-8eeb-2ff7c704221b_736x120.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Initially, platform revenues took a hit from the coronavirus pandemic as businesses all over the world were struggling with operating expenses.

The closest comparison is arguably Netflix.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18e7ef37-1df9-44c5-8f11-29224b1f39fd_855x507.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18e7ef37-1df9-44c5-8f11-29224b1f39fd_855x507.png" width="855" height="507" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/18e7ef37-1df9-44c5-8f11-29224b1f39fd_855x507.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:507,&quot;width&quot;:855,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:62287,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18e7ef37-1df9-44c5-8f11-29224b1f39fd_855x507.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18e7ef37-1df9-44c5-8f11-29224b1f39fd_855x507.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18e7ef37-1df9-44c5-8f11-29224b1f39fd_855x507.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18e7ef37-1df9-44c5-8f11-29224b1f39fd_855x507.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>As you can see from the above chart, even though Netflix are carrying substantially higher levels of debt, Netflix are still valued at a more reasonable rate.

Conclusion</h2><p>To conclude, as the cord cutting trend continues to gather momentum, more and more TV ad dollars are leaking from linear TV to Connected TV. Roku are a tremendous &#8216;pure-play&#8217; in connected TV ads space - with a large share of the market, growing user-base, growing hours watched and an industry-leading ARPU of $32.14 (with room to grow).</p><p>Roku sits firmly in the middle of the competition for eyeballs within the streaming sector, while the other SVOD services such as Netflix, Amazon and Disney jostle for market share via new content. </p><p>Roku&#8217;s upside is agnostic to the ongoing &#8216;streaming wars&#8217; - benefitting from the overall upward trend of streaming. In other words, as long as the overall streaming industry continues to grow and Roku maintain their position within the industry, then the company will do very well. Roku is an advertising play. If you have faith in the cord-cutting trend playing out, Roku will likely be a good investment.</p><p>Lastly, as a company whose share price has been rocketing over the past several years, finding an entry point has been difficult (to say the least). These recent lows in the stock market have resulted in Roku hitting their 200 day moving average - and I believe this may be a good opportunity to buy a great company at a reasonable price.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Innovestor</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
