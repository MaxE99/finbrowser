With the former running the company&#8217;s development team and the latter operating as the company&#8217;s Director of Operations, the two became increasingly aware of the disjointedness of their teams as a whole. If one looks at the interconnectedness of the modern software-oriented enterprise, this may come as a surprise, however, at the time, teams were fragmented. Developers, i.e. the individuals that wrote the code for companies, would finish an application, and throw said application over the fence, so to speak, to members of the operations team, i.e. individuals charged with building and maintaining servers, ensuring network functionality etc.,  whom, once the application was received, would be in charge of maintaining its functionality, troubleshooting issues etc. The siloed nature of these interactions created inefficiencies within software organizations, greatly increasing complexities and leading to headaches experienced by all those involved. Luckily, Datadog arose from these struggles, with Oliver stating the following in a 2020 fireside chat, a statement that nicely encapsulates the blossoming of a billion dollar idea from metaphorical ashes:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;So the starting point for Datadog was that there must be a better way for people to talk to each other.&nbsp; We wanted to build a system that brought the two sides of the house together, all of the data was available to both and they speak the same language and see the same reality.&nbsp; It turns out, it was not just us, it was the whole industry that was going this way.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>With the benefit of hindsight on our side, the company quite evidently got itself in front of two major trends. The first was the rise of the &#8220;Devops&#8221;, i.e. the unification of the development and operations facets of software engineering and the exact opposite of the previously outlined phenomena above. The second was the rise of the cloud, a happening that would fundamentally alter the functionality and capabilities of software as a whole. The amalgamation of these two trends resulted in the creation of Datadog&#8217;s cloud-based monitoring and analytics platform. Originally focused on infrastructure monitoring, application performance monitoring and log management, the company has leveraged second-to-none product release rates in order to offer additional functionality ranging from Network and Database Monitoring to Continuous Improvement Monitoring and Workload Security, as examples, in order to power modern DevOps, and more recently DevSecOps teams.&nbsp;</p><p>With this brief introduction in mind, let&#8217;s take a look at some of the key trends and opportunities Datadog aims to leverage as spurring tailwinds in the coming years.</p><div><hr></div><p>&nbsp;<strong>2.0 Opportunity&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Before delving into projections associated with the end markets Datadog&#8217;s products are geared towards, it is useful to stay more surface level for a second and pinpoint some key happenings within the modern enterprise that Datadog is set to react positively to. More specifically, the company is likely to benefit from the continued digital transformation, mainly spurred by further cloud penetration, of almost every business, as well as the resiliency of the associated spend as a whole. A recent survey performed by MS, of which detailed responses of CIOs of some large technology companies yielded some interesting corroborative insights, particularly how approximately 25% of application workloads currently resided in the cloud, a value that is anticipated to reach 44% by <a href="https://cloudedjudgement.substack.com/p/clouded-judgement-11422?utm_source=url">2024</a>. Judging by the success Datadog has already been able to garner with cloud adoption, as well as the fact that adoption still has a significant runway, this is an exciting prospect. In addition, Security Software, Cloud Computing, Digital Transformation and AI+ML + process automation, remained the 4 IT projects that were the least likely to get cut within associated enterprises, encouraging given the level of exposure Datadog has to each of these facets, as well as the fact that the anti-fragility of these areas allows for us to successfully underwrite continued growth in Datadog&#8217;s business, despite looming macroeconomic conditions that are likely to be stress factors for many other high-flying SaaS companies. </p><p>IT Operations Management, the market that encompasses most of the company&#8217;s technology offerings, is expected to represent a $44B opportunity, as per the company&#8217;s 2021 10-K.&nbsp; Though a tall figure, this estimate is largely based on on-prem infrastructure, and both fails to consider and largely underestimates the role of cloud and hybrid cloud environments. Ramblings aside, Datadog is uniquely positioned amongst competition to stand out within various associated facets. Delving deeper we can gauge third-party opinion on the competitive position of companies that are able to offer solutions for observability use-cases, such as AIOps and Application Performance Monitoring.

AI IT Ops</figcaption></figure></div><p>What the above discussion does not convey is the sheer speed at which Datadog is releasing their products, a phenomenon that only increases the number of addressable markets the company is targeting with their technology, and the total value that is ripe for the taking as a result. To further cement what I am trying to convey here, it is useful to look at what the Datadog platform has consisted of over the course of the few years that the company has been public. In the 2020 10-K, Datadog outlines that, as of December 2019, their platform contained Infrastructure Monitoring, Application Performance Monitoring, Log Management, Synthetics and Real User Monitoring, Network Performance Monitoring and Security Monitoring, for a total of 7 product categories. By December 2020, the company had added two new products, Incident Management and Continuous Profiler. Flash forward to early 2022, after extreme bouts of activity and announcements made in last year&#8217;s annual Dash Conference, the number of products has risen to 14, with new additions including CI Visibility, CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management), Workload Security, to name a few. In short, the company is leveraging substantial amounts of R&amp;D spend as well as the occasional M&amp;A effort to continuously improve their product offerings, an endeavour that expands their reach into a variety of different end-markets that are likely to undergo substantial growth in the coming years.</p><p>But why does all of this matter? Before delving deeper into the company&#8217;s technology we must first understand, broadly, its usefulness. Observability, from a fundamental perspective, can be defined as the ability to measure the internal states of a system by examining its associated outputs. Applied to Datadog&#8217;s platform, and associated IT systems as a whole, the ability to leverage telemetry data ranging from metrics, to logs and traces, is immensely powerful, seeing as it allows for teams to be able to gain heightened insights into the functionality of their systems, quickly pinpoint root causes of underperformance or failures and work to resolve issues, and determine different sources of underperformance or areas for improvement. With the rise of the cloud, an increasing abundance of applications that are crucial for the modern enterprise and their clients, as well as a constantly expanding network of intertwined servers, databases, etc. this has never been more important.&nbsp;</p><p>In short, I would like you take away the following from this opportunity. Observability and IT Operations Management is a significant opportunity for Datadog to capitalize on.

Within most companies now, these logs are abundant given the sheer breadth of sources these are gathered from, ranging from containers to mobile devices and web browsers. Datadog&#8217;s log capabilities collect and archive all of the company's logs, then allowing for indexing to occur, metrics to be generated from patterns/anomalies to be associated with said data.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>APM and Continuous Profiler&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p>The primary objective of APM (Application Performance Management) is to monitor and manage the performance of an enterprise&#8217;s applications, maintaining a degree of usability and expected level of service for its associated end-users. Datadog&#8217;s APM solution correlates traces, i.e. information that details how long a request took, which components of an application were interacted with and the latency involved with each interaction, with both front-end and back-end data in order to provide insights regarding, errors, performance hindrances etc. Continuous Profiler functionality goes one step further, going code-level to to various components of an app to gain insight and address problems associated with performance.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Database Monitoring&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p>Datadog&#8217;s database monitoring tool provides insight and visibility into an enterprise&#8217;s database across their hosting environments. Within, dashboards can be created to track different metrics, identify database queries that are resource intensive, identify the root cause of slow queries, as examples. In addition, explain plans help with the understanding of how a database returns queries, of which can be used to identify bottlenecks and improve efficiencies.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F362c4851-cc0e-48be-8602-ac07a1171829_1600x855.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F362c4851-cc0e-48be-8602-ac07a1171829_1600x855.png" width="1456" height="778" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/362c4851-cc0e-48be-8602-ac07a1171829_1600x855.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:778,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F362c4851-cc0e-48be-8602-ac07a1171829_1600x855.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F362c4851-cc0e-48be-8602-ac07a1171829_1600x855.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F362c4851-cc0e-48be-8602-ac07a1171829_1600x855.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F362c4851-cc0e-48be-8602-ac07a1171829_1600x855.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Database Monitoring Dashboard Example</figcaption></figure></div><p><em><strong>Synthetic Monitoring&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p>Synthetic monitoring is essentially a process by which applications and systems are monitored through the simulation of user interaction with said app, API or system.

Whether their application is a javascript app, android or iOS app etc., Datadog allows for data to be collected on each user&#8217;s interaction with the app, of which can then be visually displayed and analyzed, utilized for troubleshooting etc. within different dashboards. In contrast to Synthetics, RUM works with actual user interactions within an app rather than their simulated counterparts.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>CI Visibility</strong></em></p><p>CI, or Continuous Integration, is essentially a DevOps practice where developers merge and integrate their code within a central depository. This process is usually paired with CD, or Continuous Delivery, in order to take code that is located in the central depository and then deliver it to production. As one can imagine, these CI/CD pipelines can be complex, prone to error and can exist as an all around time-sink if done improperly within an organization. Datadog&#8217;s CI functionality allows for developers to monitor and pinpoint pipeline failures, monitor trends and execution times and leverage data to garner insights as to how the pipeline can be improved for future performance, costs can be reduced etc.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02667caf-7d2d-4bf2-a66f-7072cb4f291d_749x437.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02667caf-7d2d-4bf2-a66f-7072cb4f291d_749x437.png" width="749" height="437" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/02667caf-7d2d-4bf2-a66f-7072cb4f291d_749x437.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:437,&quot;width&quot;:749,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02667caf-7d2d-4bf2-a66f-7072cb4f291d_749x437.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02667caf-7d2d-4bf2-a66f-7072cb4f291d_749x437.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02667caf-7d2d-4bf2-a66f-7072cb4f291d_749x437.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02667caf-7d2d-4bf2-a66f-7072cb4f291d_749x437.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">CI Visibility Dashboard Example</figcaption></figure></div><p><em><strong>Serverless</strong></em></p><p>As you may have guessed, Serverless development consists of developers building and running applications, all whilst not managing an intertwined server.

moving to the cloud, CSPM extends Datadog&#8217;s Cloud Security Platform in order to track and ensure that an organization&#8217;s environment is compliant, automates audit evidence gathering, and helps to ensure that there are no misconfigurations within an organization&#8217;s infrastructure that would be susceptible to breaches.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a

On the development side of things, how each product is designed compliments this strategy quite nicely. More specifically, customers, when they opt into a new Datadog product, are able to extract value from said product almost instantaneously. In comparison to other SaaS company competitors, where time-to-value is often substantially longer, this greatly reduces the risk in leveraging Datadog&#8217;s services from the customer&#8217;s point of view. In addition, with Datadog&#8217;s second-to-none development speed, they are constantly adding on functionality and products to their platform that compliment one another and both align and offer essential capabilities to the modern digital enterprise. With this development cadence, the company is able to land and expand in a way that customer&#8217;s cannot, and will be able to demonstrate strong DBNR and ARR numbers that incumbents will have a difficult time replicating, but I will touch upon that more later.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>5.0 Financial Analysis&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Within this section I will delve into Datadog&#8217;s most recent Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement for Q4&#8217;21 and FY&#8217;21 as a whole.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Income Statement&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p><em>Revenue</em></p><p>Datadog&#8217;s Revenue came in at $1.029B representing a 70% increase YoY.

In short, Datadog is not cheap, but this a phenomenon that has been rampant over the course of history when we are dealing with the best companies in the world. I have already mentioned their development cadence, however, it is worth highlighting the history that the company has of lowballing expectations and beating them by a significant margin. In their most recent earrings release, Datadog provided Top-Line guidance of $1510M and $334M for FY&#8217;22 and Q1&#8217;22 (low end of associated ranges), of which would represent a 47% YoY increase and 68% increase YoY, respectively. Looking at the company&#8217;s average beat of approximately 11%, as outlined below, this is likely to be exceeded with ease in the coming quarters. As such, I would not be surprised if the company achieves high 50% Top-Line growth for FY&#8217;22 as a whole.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F145065fb-203f-453b-ba11-3030ab962364_1600x827.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F145065fb-203f-453b-ba11-3030ab962364_1600x827.png" width="1456" height="753" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/145065fb-203f-453b-ba11-3030ab962364_1600x827.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:753,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F145065fb-203f-453b-ba11-3030ab962364_1600x827.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F145065fb-203f-453b-ba11-3030ab962364_1600x827.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F145065fb-203f-453b-ba11-3030ab962364_1600x827.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F145065fb-203f-453b-ba11-3030ab962364_1600x827.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>In short, I view the valuation of Datadog as its biggest risk. Execution will have to be near flawless in the coming quarters and I am okay with taking that risk. Management has continually over achieved, the company&#8217;s end market is far from developed and we are in the midst of a technological trend in the cloud that is changing modern companies in an unprecedented manner. This presents itself as an asymmetric opportunity and is exactly the type of hyper-growth story I like to expose myself to. </p><p>Before concluding this deep-dive, it is important that we understand Datadog&#8217;s competitive positioning relative to other incumbents. Main competitors, in public markets, to make note of are Dynatrace, New Relic, Splunk and Elastic, each of which have capable, albeit inferior, technology to Datadog, in my opinion. To spare you a 100+ page deep analysis, I am going to stay high level here and look at some key metrics for comparative purposes. If you wish to go deeper on the nuances of peers&#8217; technology, I recommend reading <a href="https://softwarestackinvesting.com/">Software Stack Investing</a> Pieces on Datadog, in which he breaks down in depth the latest activity of competitors and outlines very clearly where the company stands relative to its peers. In addition, Mujii at <a href="https://hhhypergrowth.com/">Hhhypergrowth</a> has broken down Datadog and some competitors in a meaningful manner. Both of these individuals have decades of experience and will do a better job than I of breaking down the competitive landscape of this tech. With that in mind, let&#8217;s compare Datadog and Peers using Customer Numbers, Revenue, YoY Revenue Growth, Gross, Operating and FCF Margins and R&amp;D/S&amp;M as % of Revenue as the main financial metrics of interest.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d931358-483c-4368-be03-0adc71480647_427x655.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d931358-483c-4368-be03-0adc71480647_427x655.png" width="427" height="655" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8d931358-483c-4368-be03-0adc71480647_427x655.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:655,&quot;width&quot;:427,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d931358-483c-4368-be03-0adc71480647_427x655.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d931358-483c-4368-be03-0adc71480647_427x655.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d931358-483c-4368-be03-0adc71480647_427x655.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d931358-483c-4368-be03-0adc71480647_427x655.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Starting off, there are some reporting nuances that complicate this comparison. More specifically, 2021A for NEWR, DT and SPLK represent the 9 months ended December 31 2021, whereas the 2021A for ESTC represents the 6 months ended December 31. Thus, in these periods margins, customers and relative R&amp;D/S&amp;M spend are the points of interest rather than top-line itself. Other points to be aware of are the fact that NewRelic switching to a self-serve initiative and consumption-based business model, a decision which resulted in a large amount of customers qualifying for the newly created free customer tie, hence the dip from 2019 to 2020 seen in Customer Numbers. In addition, Splunk stopped disclosing the number of customers just in time for the release of their FY&#8217;21 earnings, roughly inline with 2020A. Staying surface level on Splunk for a second, I am always cautious when a company stops reporting a key performance indicator so long after they IPO&#8217;d. In general, if a company felt it necessary to disclose a metric in the S-1, shareholders should generally expect this to continue in every reporting period thereafter, unless the company has significantly altered their business as a whole. This phenomenon, especially when viewed alongside the fact that Splunk&#8217;s incumbents are growing so fast, is a red flag to me and leads me to believe they&#8217;ve had a material slowdown in the amount of customers since then, a phenomenon which is correlated by the relative stagnation seen in Top-Line of late.&nbsp;</p><p>Delving deeper into metric-specific conclusions, and if we assume that Splunk has Customers in the low 20,000s, Datadog has the second highest customer numbers, and is demonstrating best-in-class growth. Datadog has the second highest top-line, a phenomenon that is likely to change in the coming years as their rapid development cycle spurs continued growth and likely eventually leads to them overtaking Splunk sooner rather than later. As a thought exercise, the company had less 1/10 of Splunk/s Revenue in 2017, a value that likely shrinks to &#189; as Splunk reports the final quarter of their fiscal year. This goes to show how fast Datadog has grasped market share, a phenomenon that is unlikely to stop given their guidance. Moving over to margins, Datadog&#8217;s Gross, Operating and FCF margins are inferior to only Dynatrace, despite operating at nearly double the Top-Line scale. Datadog&#8217;s Gross Margins are likely to remain similar to what they are now, however, the company has been showing more and more operating leverage of late , so I am confident that Operating Margin is likely to head into positive territory in the coming years. Looking at relative R&amp;D and S&amp;M spend for Datadog is clearly where the business shines. The company showcases the most efficient S&amp;M spend in comparison to peers, and has decreased this magnitude by the largest margin in comparison to its counterparts.

Within this composition the listener is exposed to a tale of reincarnation, where a man describes his experiences across multiple different lifetimes, the first as a Highwayman, followed successively by lives as a Sailor, a Damn Builder and the Captain of a Starship. Within the last verse, the man ponders his next medium of existence, as outlined below:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Ill fly a starship</p><p>Across the Universe divide</p><p>And when I reach the other side</p><p>I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can</p><p>Perhaps I may become a highwayman again</p><p>Or I may simply be a single drop of rain</p><p>But I will remain</p></blockquote><p>This song is a powerful representation of the hypothetical scenario by where one&#8217;s spirit lives on past the finite existence of their body, and I couldn&#8217;t help coming back to it as I learned more about the music industry over the course of this deep-dive. There is something deeply powerful about music as an art-form. It has the ability to evoke feelings ranging from joy to sadness, can spur nostalgia or the reminiscence over a specific moment in time, and is one of the few things in life, in my opinion, that can dim one&#8217;s anxieties over the past or the present and transport them truly into the now. Music&#8217;s origins, arguably, stem back to the earliest instances of humanity and will likely exist alongside our species until the very end. Taking the framework outlined by The Highwayman, the medium by which music is housed may differ with respect to time, but, at the end of the day, music will remain.&nbsp;</p><p>To get a little bit of background on how the industry as a whole has evolved, we must first split music into three main sound constituents: analog, digital and virtual, each of which contain their own associated revolutions and have brought us to where we are today. Starting off with Analog, two key evolutions can be contained within, the emergence of the magnetic tape recorder and vinyl. The former has roots in Nazi-Germany, with the US obtaining audio recording technology that was developed during the war, post-allied victory, eventually using this information as a foundation for the first magnetic tape recorder, of which was released in 1948. The latter emerged around the same time, with the first records existing as 7-inch discs that could be played at almost 80 RPMs, supporting less than four minutes of playback on each side. Each of these technologies not only spurred consistent consumption of music by providing access to the art form that was only possible previously through live performance, but also resulted in a large amount of power being obtained and centered within record labels. With expensive equipment such such as pre-amplifiers, compressors, equalizers, soundboards and recording machines all being required to create music, and substantial resources needed to market and release said music, artists were largely at the mercy of these entities, a phenomenon that is omni-present today. </p><p>Moving on, in the late 1970s, the music industry started to feel the fact that vinyl record sales were dropping, a happening that resulted in the emergence of CDs in 1982. With the rise of digital recording methods decreasing costs associated with music production, the emergence of computers, as well as heightened consumption of music on the consumer-side of things, industry revenues went through the roof, reaching levels that have never been seen again. Being that as it may, the rise of the internet started to exploit holes in the value proposition labels were directing at customers. Elegantly explained within a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2hn7vEyDuukvRdW5Qi5z6A?si=e1f6402f9c3c4a49">Business Breakdown Podcast of UMG</a> was the fact that there was an extremely high threshold for music consumption, with the industry being front-loaded to have revenue generated and profits made with initial purchases rather than over the lifetime of a customer, as seen with streaming today. With the rise of virtual sound, spurred by both Mp3 algorithms allowing for audio file sizes to be drastically reduced and widespread adoption of internet, ripping services soon took off, arguably coming into fruition as a response to the aforementioned consumer issues. The most popular of these technologies was Napster, a P2P file sharing service that allowed for users to obtain music with no upfront cost, solving some of the previously outlined issues with physical consumption mediums.

preferences for different forms of audio, of which can then be used to recommend audio in the forms of mixes, playlists and podcast suggestions. Using Discover Weekly as an example, it is estimated that the average user that interacts with this playlist is around <a href="https://www.ped30.com/2021/12/20/morgan-stanley-spotify-huge-key-demo-apple-music-also-ran/">2X</a> more engaged than the users that don&#8217;t, indicative of a preference for data-driven curated content suggestions. In the 2021 Invest Like the Best Podcast, Ek outlined the fact that he was always hesitant to discard any data since Spotify&#8217;s inception, despite pushes from employees. At the time this could&#8217;ve occurred without blinking twice, however looking at how technology has evolved since then, specifically with ML and AI, it is great that he didn&#8217;t. You can see how data has been incorporated into Spotify&#8217;s products by taking a second to ponder how exactly they&#8217;ve changed with respect to time. Years ago playlists may have been generic and separated by genre or artist, now if two users open up their Hip Hop mixes, as an example, they are likely to have a completely different set of songs recommended to them. </p><p>Challenges arise when a similar approach is taken to Podcasting. From a time point of view, the error of consumption is much higher. If I listen to a bad three minute song, the repercussions of this decision or recommendation are much lower in comparison to the substantially larger time investment that is required for one to immerse themselves within a podcast. This is where the Podz acquisition comes into play. In essence the now-umbrella company leverages ML/AI to create an audio news feed of different 60 second clips, allowing consumers to browse new podcasts in an easily digestible manner. In a great <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/podz-and-the-future-of-audio">Not Boring Article about Podz,</a> Packy outlined the fact that Instagram reinvented Facebook by providing quality photos on mobile, TikTok reinvented Youtube with immersive mobile video, Twitter reinvented news media with short blurbs of information and now the Spotify+Podz combination may be able to offer a similar value proposition for Podcasting, exciting to say the least.&nbsp;</p><p>Spotify&#8217;s growth tactics and reach within the Podcast space do not stop there. A few years ago the company acquired Anchor, an enterprise that has a suite of different tools for podcast creation, distribution and monetization.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76b3c209-ed19-4416-9fd5-51c4dea6f796_812x962.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76b3c209-ed19-4416-9fd5-51c4dea6f796_812x962.png" width="440" height="521.2807881773399" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/76b3c209-ed19-4416-9fd5-51c4dea6f796_812x962.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:962,&quot;width&quot;:812,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:440,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76b3c209-ed19-4416-9fd5-51c4dea6f796_812x962.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76b3c209-ed19-4416-9fd5-51c4dea6f796_812x962.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76b3c209-ed19-4416-9fd5-51c4dea6f796_812x962.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76b3c209-ed19-4416-9fd5-51c4dea6f796_812x962.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><a href="https://anchor.fm/">Anchor UX</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>To gauge just how successful this acquisition has been one can look at the 2021 Podcast Wrapped Report numbers, which outlines the fact that a staggering 1.2M podcasts were added to Spotify in 2021, of which 80% were published by independent creators on <a href="https://pr-newsroom-wp.appspot.com/2021-12-16/2021-wrapped-for-podcasters-shows-that-more-people-are-becoming-audio-creators/#:~:text=We%20believe%20that%20a%20huge,%2Din%2Done%20podcasting%20platform">Anchor</a>!

What Spotify denotes as Strategic Ad insertion (SAI) is essentially the ability for advertisements to actually be successful no matter what the audience type or size may be. Whether one has a podcast to a small group of thirty listeners talking about Japanese contemporary fiction, or if they have a huge following talking about the latest and greatest technology companies, the theoretical ROI on ad placement should still be the same. This creates an interesting flywheel dynamic of which was mentioned in the most <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4483756-spotify-technology-sa-spot-ceo-daniel-ek-on-q4-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript">recent earnings conference call</a>. As more creators join the platform, the more audiences should grow and the more advertisers will want to join the platform to fill said inventory of both Spotify original and third-party megaphone and anchor created content alike.&nbsp;With all of these moving pieces, when the dest settles you are left with podcasting ad tech stack that is powerful to say the least, with the buy and supply side of the ad network now interconnected within SPAN. </p><p>I also am a fan of how Spotify is really upping their value proposition to Podcast Creators. Outside of the ability to create and distribute their podcasts using Spotify, the company&#8217;s Open Access Platform is something truly unique in the space. They can not only earn advertising dollars on their content, they also now have additional monetization options such as taking the premium subscription route. This is not only native to content created on the platform, Spotify allows for users that are members of third-party platform&#8217;s podcasts to import their membership to and listen to associated content on Spotify (i.e. if I am a member of Motley Fool I can listen to premium pods through the Spotify app).&nbsp;</p><p>The company is also further bolstering the opportunity for advertising through their recent acquisition of Whooshkaa, a company that allows radio broadcasters to turn their existing audio content into on-demand podcast content. In short, this happening allows for more third-party content to be brought into the Audience network, which as a result connects advertiser with another set of audiences. As a side tangent, this also may further enrich Spotify&#8217;s ability to continue to take more market share from AM/FM radio, but that is a little more speculative.&nbsp;</p><p>Another top-of-funnel strategy that is likely to reap continuous rewards is the company&#8217;s continuous betterment of their exclusive podcast content. As i&#8217;m sure most of you are aware, the company has not been shy with the amount of effort they&#8217;ve put towards acquiring star-studded Spotify Original or Spotify Exclusive content, or the capital that has been directed at these efforts. The company has acquired Gimlet, a studio that has produced the likes of Reply All, Startup and other popular shows that have garnered large amounts of media attention. The company acquired Paracast, which contains two production studios under its umbrella, of which have created 121+ hit podcasts. In addition, the company acquired The Ringer, a studio founded by Bill Simmons, of which has enormously popular sports and sports culture-centered podcasts. In short, the company has quite evidently beefed up their podcast offerings, a phenomenon I believe showcases how serious they are about this opportunity. Not only can the company leverage pricing power on both the advertising on exclusive content, as an example, or the licensing of in-house created original content, but this is also an enormously useful customer acquisition tool. Using Call Her Daddy as an example, someone may become enamoured with the show, listen to it on Spotify due to the exclusivity arrangement, and then become a premium subscriber or ad-supported MAU as a result. Even Joe Rogan, who has been subject to an extreme amount of criticism/negative publicity of late, has only grown more popular. In Q3&#8217;21, he garnered more attention than any other mainstream news program, and google search trends have skyrocketed over the last few weeks. Regardless of your opinion of the man, this is quite evidently a net positive investment for Spotify.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b600fbd-b63d-4c00-b018-f4cab0217284_500x500.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b600fbd-b63d-4c00-b018-f4cab0217284_500x500.png" width="288" height="288" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0b600fbd-b63d-4c00-b018-f4cab0217284_500x500.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:500,&quot;width&quot;:500,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:288,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b600fbd-b63d-4c00-b018-f4cab0217284_500x500.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b600fbd-b63d-4c00-b018-f4cab0217284_500x500.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b600fbd-b63d-4c00-b018-f4cab0217284_500x500.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b600fbd-b63d-4c00-b018-f4cab0217284_500x500.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><a href="https://twitter.com/Danstringer74/status/1489390816036470784/photo/1">Joe Rogan vs. Popular News Broadcast Programs</a></figcaption></figure></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb21f032a-032e-4fd7-9d85-3cffc8229c0c_859x410.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb21f032a-032e-4fd7-9d85-3cffc8229c0c_859x410.png" width="498" height="237.69499417927824" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b21f032a-032e-4fd7-9d85-3cffc8229c0c_859x410.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:410,&quot;width&quot;:859,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:498,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb21f032a-032e-4fd7-9d85-3cffc8229c0c_859x410.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb21f032a-032e-4fd7-9d85-3cffc8229c0c_859x410.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb21f032a-032e-4fd7-9d85-3cffc8229c0c_859x410.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb21f032a-032e-4fd7-9d85-3cffc8229c0c_859x410.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Joe Rogan Google Search Trends</figcaption></figure></div><p>Sticking with podcasts for just one more moment, Spotify acquired Podsights just last night, an exciting acquisition that will bolster their ad tech platform&#8217;s ability to offer insights to ad publishers.

And now with the acquisition of Chartable, we will be further enhancing Megaphone&#8217;s suite of tools with the integration of Chartable&#8217;s audience insights and cutting-edge promotional tools, SmartLinks and SmartPromos. These tools will make it easier for publishers to turn audience insights into action and expand their listenership while ultimately growing their businesses.</p></blockquote><p>Moving on, we should touch upon the company&#8217;s acquisition of Betty Labs and Locker Room. Locker Room is essentially an audio-first sports talk platform that lets fans follow different news breaks, interact socially with friends and listen to their favourite commentators LIVE. Putting emphasis on this audio being live is of importance here, specifically since it most likely represents the early instances of potentially much larger future endeavours that Spotify has planned for this space. Despite Clubhouse falling in and out of pop culture&#8217;s grace, there is likely still a significant opportunity in this area, particularly when applied to scenarios such as digital concerts, as speculated about earlier.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6bf03c4-3a4b-4385-8764-5cd8ff36e7b5_859x410.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6bf03c4-3a4b-4385-8764-5cd8ff36e7b5_859x410.png" width="536" height="255.8323632130384" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e6bf03c4-3a4b-4385-8764-5cd8ff36e7b5_859x410.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:410,&quot;width&quot;:859,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:536,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6bf03c4-3a4b-4385-8764-5cd8ff36e7b5_859x410.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6bf03c4-3a4b-4385-8764-5cd8ff36e7b5_859x410.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6bf03c4-3a4b-4385-8764-5cd8ff36e7b5_859x410.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6bf03c4-3a4b-4385-8764-5cd8ff36e7b5_859x410.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Clubhouse Popularity Over Time</figcaption></figure></div><p>As an example, the Fortnite Rift Tour featuring Ariana Grande garnered around 2M views after the fact and 10s of millions of views at the time of occurrence, so speculating here about live audio eventually being intertwined with Spotify&#8217;s platform is exciting to say the least.&nbsp;</p><div id="youtube2-gGYElBtjytU" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;gGYElBtjytU&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gGYElBtjytU?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>Spotify has also started their journey into the Audiobook space with their acquisition of Findaway.

More specifically, Spotify is required to pay out royalties to a host of different parties depending on where they are located within the music value chain. Two pieces were instrumental in my understanding of this topic. The first was <a href="https://sleepwell.substack.com/p/music-streaming-royalties-101">Sleepwell&#8217;s Music Streaming Royalties 101</a> and the second was <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d8b3d89ba59d07f93b338d0/t/61f818386a6e361b706bf666/1643649088412/SPOT.pdf">Patient Capital&#8217;s Slide Deck</a>, I highly recommend giving both a read. I will be summarizing the associated information the best I can but feel free to go straight to the source if these explanations are not sufficient.&nbsp;</p><p>The first thing one needs to understand is that a song can be split into two components, the <em>composition</em>, i.e. if music were translated into its written form (attributable to the publishing industry) and the master, i.e. the recording of said song after it has been produced (attributable to the recorded music industry). The publishing constituents will receive two sets of royalties in exchange for the use of the composition: performance royalties (paid every time music is performed in a public setting) and mechanical royalties (every time music is reproduced through a physical medium). Upon receipt of either of these royalties, cuts will be distributed to the collection agency or performance rights organization, the publisher and the songwriter. The recorded music constituents receive royalties each time a song is streamed and cuts are distributed to labels/distributors, depending on if you&#8217;re a signed or indie artist, producers and managers and finally, the performer. If you would like a more in-depth explanation regarding the nuances of these relationships I encourage you to read the aforementioned sources, however, for the sake of brevity, I have stuck to a more analytical approach. More specifically, as Spotify receives paid-subscription revenue, this is pooled together and then distributed to related parties on a per-stream basis.  I have outlined the percentages that gets kept by the company themselves as well as the percentage distributed to other parties, for both the scenario where the artist is signed with a label, and for the scenario where they are independent.

As such, a discussion regarding the nature of these relationships is worthwhile. Researching this dynamic I kept coming back to this verse from one of my favourite songs, The Devil Wears a Suit and Tie by Colter Wall.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&#8230;</p><p>I heard him howlin' as he passed me by, and he said</p><p>I know you I know you, young man, I know you by the state of your hands</p><p>You're a six string picker, just as I... I am</p><p>Let me learn ya some I know a few turns to make all the girls dance</p><p> Don't you know the Devil wears a suit and tie, I saw him driving down the sixty one in early July, </p><p>White as a cotton field, and sharp as a knife, I heard him howlin' as he passed me by</p><p>Foolish foolish was I, damn my foolish eyes</p><p>Cause that man's lessons had a price, oh sweet price</p><p>My sweet soul, everlasting</p><p>My very own, Eternal light</p></blockquote><p>The song details an experience a young musician had with the Devil, wherein he sold his soul in exchange for learning the songs that would make all the girls dance. Related back to this research piece, i&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard many a story from artists outlining how they&#8217;ve had to sell their souls to labels in order to make their dreams a reality. Although there is most definitely a case for the labels striking relationships that are more fair to the artist, there is more to the story than that. Labels operate in a very similar way to Venture Capital Firms, where their businesses are reliant on a small amount of out-sized returns in order to remain profitable. Circling back to the aforementioned UMG podcast, mentioned within was the fact that only approximately 10% of the artists that sign with a label actually recoup their initial investment. <a href="https://cdixon.org/2015/06/07/the-babe-ruth-effect-in-venture-capital">In a Chris Dixon</a> article a similar story is outlined for VC firms, with data from 1985 onwards outlining the fact that approximately 6% of the investments drove around 60% of the returns.&nbsp; For the artists that do make it big, this deal does often times end up being unfair, however, for the artists that don&#8217;t make it big, they got a shot to follow their dream and oftentimes had the help of substantial amounts of resources to do just that, so the same can&#8217;t really be said. With over 60,000 new songs uploaded to Spotify each day, labels still have a value proposition in the industry that is not going away anytime soon. Outside of labels owning a large amount of back catalog music that Spotify require for their library, labels also offer artists their abundant marketing, outreach and PR resources, their connections etc. which on paper don&#8217;t seem like much, but at the end of the day could be the difference between them standing out in within the expanding abyss or not.&nbsp;</p><p>Before moving on, one should also note the fact that the company doesn&#8217;t distinguish between Revenue generated by audio type, or the costs associated with said audio type. In essence, this means that the labels are likely getting a piece of the pie when said pie is generated by podcast consumption (as an example). I believe this is a component of the company&#8217;s business model that will have to change in the coming years, especially as the company starts capitalizing on the all things audio opportunity. </p><div><hr></div><p><strong>5.0 Financial Analysis&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Please note that I used a 1.13 EUR to USD conversion factor within this analysis.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Income Statement&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p><em>Revenue</em></p><p>Spotify&#8217;s Revenue came in at approximately $9.67B for 2021, representing a 23% increase on a YoY basis.

With the audio consumption of their users starting to include more podcasts, the ad-developments associated with SPAN and the leveraging of the abundance of user-data that can be bolstered to create extremely effective ad-targeting, I believe ARPU in this area should steadily increase, and in order for Spotify to reach the height of their ambitions it will need to.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>7.0 Thesis</strong></p><p>My thesis for holding Spotify is threefold. First I believe audio has been significantly under monetized and similar to its video and video-game counterparts will start to realize its full potential through Spotify&#8217;s International Expansion, Focus on Ads and Exertion of Pricing Power. Second, after studying how Spotify is connected to Record Labels I believe they are beginning to have the upper hand in this relationship and will potentially be able to leverage their position in order to improve the health of both their Gross Margins and Bottom Line. Third, I believe Spotify will continue to exert dominance in the Audio Industry as a whole and with a strategically-aligned and focused management team should be able to continue to wane competitive forces.&nbsp;</p><p>Starting with Audio and circling back to Matthew Ball&#8217;s Audio Opportunity piece, when we compare the aforementioned revenues attributable to the audio industry as a whole, with those of video and video games, there is an evident stark contrast:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4016c0a-62b7-4868-b5db-d6811c259cf0_1000x587.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4016c0a-62b7-4868-b5db-d6811c259cf0_1000x587.png" width="490" height="287.63" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c4016c0a-62b7-4868-b5db-d6811c259cf0_1000x587.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:587,&quot;width&quot;:1000,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:490,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4016c0a-62b7-4868-b5db-d6811c259cf0_1000x587.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4016c0a-62b7-4868-b5db-d6811c259cf0_1000x587.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4016c0a-62b7-4868-b5db-d6811c259cf0_1000x587.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4016c0a-62b7-4868-b5db-d6811c259cf0_1000x587.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">US Video-Related Revenue</figcaption></figure></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b83a0c7-c36b-46f4-be68-9eb020b3fc55_1000x587.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b83a0c7-c36b-46f4-be68-9eb020b3fc55_1000x587.png" width="492" height="288.804" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0b83a0c7-c36b-46f4-be68-9eb020b3fc55_1000x587.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:587,&quot;width&quot;:1000,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:492,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b83a0c7-c36b-46f4-be68-9eb020b3fc55_1000x587.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b83a0c7-c36b-46f4-be68-9eb020b3fc55_1000x587.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b83a0c7-c36b-46f4-be68-9eb020b3fc55_1000x587.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b83a0c7-c36b-46f4-be68-9eb020b3fc55_1000x587.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">US Video Game Consumer Spend</figcaption></figure></div><p>All three industries have experience rapid digitization but audio has not reached the revenues reached in the late 90s again.

Not only does the company have a more engaged user base as alluded to earlier, but they also benefit from having more listeners in different audio segments, i.e. music and podcasting (as previously discussed the company recently surpassed Apple&#8217;s podcast listeners in the States). In addition the company also benefits from a management teams with levels of skin in the game and a focus on the audio experience as a whole that I believe cannot be replicated by Big Tech. Using both company and Edison Research estimates data we can then compare the amount of premium subscribers attributable to each company:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe903942b-c0fa-4b4b-8df4-eb033a2762fb_495x113.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe903942b-c0fa-4b4b-8df4-eb033a2762fb_495x113.png" width="495" height="113" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e903942b-c0fa-4b4b-8df4-eb033a2762fb_495x113.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:113,&quot;width&quot;:495,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe903942b-c0fa-4b4b-8df4-eb033a2762fb_495x113.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe903942b-c0fa-4b4b-8df4-eb033a2762fb_495x113.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe903942b-c0fa-4b4b-8df4-eb033a2762fb_495x113.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe903942b-c0fa-4b4b-8df4-eb033a2762fb_495x113.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The above numbers of competitors should be taken as ballpark estimates, however, Spotify quite clearly is dominant and I believe they will only be widening this gap in the coming years.

The internet exists as a gateway to endless arrays of information, entertainment sources, connections with fellow members of our species and now, more times than not, presents itself as one of the most common mediums for interaction between corporation and consumer. With businesses intertwining their processes with an online world, breaches to their connected infrastructure not only pose a risk to their processes, infrastructure and technology, but also to the people that use them. When delving into the plethora of high-profile security breaches, one may recall instances like the 2017 Equifax data breach, where attackers exfiltrated hundreds of millions of customer records from the credit company, or the 2019/2020 SolarWinds Orion product breach, an occurrence that left the data, networks and systems of thousands of customers, ranging from Fortune 500 entities to Government Agencies, at the mercy of said hackers. There is an ever-increasing need for companies to create technology and services that help protect our digital world from the looming risk of security breaches and Crowdstrike offers itself as a shining light amongst darkness. Put simply, Crowdstrike provides technology that primarily protects an Enterprise&#8217;s Endpoints, with additional modules aimed at shielding Companies&#8217; Cloud Workloads. We will delve further into the technical specifics of the company&#8217;s products in later sections, but for now it is important to become familiar with the Crowdstrike Falcon Platform, of which contains a series of security modules, each providing functionality related but not limited to corporate workload security, vulnerability management, managed security services, IT operations management, threat intelligence services, identity protection and log management, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>With this brief overview in mind, let&#8217;s delve deeper into the Cybersecurity space as a whole and analyze the main tailwinds the company aims to leverage within their operations and growth initiatives.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>2.0 Background and Opportunity&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The main area of Cybersecurity that one should familiarize themselves with in order to gain a heightened understanding of Crowdstrike&#8217;s operations is Endpoint Security. According to Gartner, a fully functional Endpoint Protection Platform should possess the following features:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Prevent and protect against security threats that include malware, malware-free or fireless exploits.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The ability to exert some form of control (allow/block) software, scripts or processes</p></li><li><p>The ability to detect and prevent threats using behavioural analysis of device activity, application and user data</p></li><li><p>Facilities to investigate security incidents further, and or obtain guidance for remediation when an exploit potentially evades protective controls</p></li></ul><p>Crowdstrike&#8217;s Falcon Platform and the associated modules contain therein mesh undeniably to satisfy each of the above criteria and I encourage you to revisit these points at different stages of the report to verify this assertion for yourself. Before delving deeper into the importance of these features we must first understand what an endpoint is. Put simply, an endpoint is any piece of hardware that connects to a network, with an example being the laptop computer you connect to your workplace&#8217;s network with. These devices will then interact with the Edge, a buzzword that I'm sure many of you have come across of late. The edge is an intermediary point between the endpoint device and either the cloud/physical database hardware, of which is commonly encompassed by/denoted as the company&#8217;s data centers. Edge devices are the network gateway that facilitates interactions between the two aforementioned entities.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27213f53-3490-4eef-bae9-09bf9fa28308_1024x684.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27213f53-3490-4eef-bae9-09bf9fa28308_1024x684.png" width="474" height="316.6171875" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/27213f53-3490-4eef-bae9-09bf9fa28308_1024x684.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:684,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:474,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27213f53-3490-4eef-bae9-09bf9fa28308_1024x684.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27213f53-3490-4eef-bae9-09bf9fa28308_1024x684.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27213f53-3490-4eef-bae9-09bf9fa28308_1024x684.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27213f53-3490-4eef-bae9-09bf9fa28308_1024x684.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Edge Computing Graphic <a href="https://innovationatwork.ieee.org/real-life-edge-computing-use-cases/">[2]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>&#8203;&#8203;When one takes into consideration the above oversimplified diagram, it is clear that through the exploitation of various types of endpoint devices, malicious actors could gain access to the company&#8217;s highly sensitive infrastructure. The most common technique to either compromise or exploit an endpoint device is malware (i.e. malicious software). There are 8 common forms of malware, of which can be seen outlined and shortly described below:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p>Adware: Unwanted, spam-like and malicious advertising that continually pop up and may result in additional malware being downloaded by the user through inadvertent interaction with said ads</p></li><li><p>Fileless malware: malware that doesn&#8217;t use executable files to infect devices but rather leverages RAM to avoid detection&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Virus: Malware that is attached to files, executes once said file is launched and encrypts, corrupts or moves data&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Worm: malware that replicates itself and spreads from device to device throughout a network&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Trojan: a program that appears to be legitimate but is in fact malicious, able to spread similarly to a Virus or Worm</p></li><li><p>Bots: Malware that performs an automated task without requiring any interaction, can quickly infect devices creating a botnet that can then be leveraged by hackers</p></li><li><p>Ransomware: Malware that encrypts a device&#8217;s data and holds said data until ransom is paid&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Spyware: malware that infiltrates a device and monitors the activities of the associated user</p></li></ol><p>With these definitions in mind, it is clear that the primary objective of an endpoint protection is the ability to negate the potential harmful effects of the wide array of aforementioned malware and (malware/file)-less attacks. We will delve into how Crowdstrike is able to successfully appease the criteria Gartner sets for EPPs, but for now, it is worth going over the general opportunity that Crowdstrike has in front of it. First off cybersecurity is an issue that is omnipresent within our global landscape and is a phenomena that companies will have to deal with likely for decades to come. According to a study performed by the Ponemon Institute, approximately 68% of organizations have experienced one or more endpoint attacks that successfully compromised data or their IT infrastructure [<a href="https://www.ponemon.org/">3</a>]. Delving deeper, ransomware, one of the most commonly used forms of malware, has been used in cyber-attacks affecting 47% of SMBs (small to medium businesses) and 54% of larger organizations (1,000-5000+ employees) <a href="https://www.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/Gated-Assets/white-papers/sophos-the-state-of-ransomware-2020-wp.pdf">[4]</a>. Endpoint breaches are not only increasing in frequency but are also becoming more destructive to resources as well, with IBM estimating that the average large-company data breach costs approximately $4.27M and a successful endpoint attack somewhere in the $7.1-$8.94M range, on average [<a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach">5</a>]. Secondly, digital transformation, though essential to sustained growth in our day and age, is likely increasing the vulnerability of the modern enterprise. Within legacy network infrastructure it was common for protection methods to encompass endpoints, various on-site users, servers, applications etc. Now this perimeter expanded, a phenomena that has obviously been aided by heightened adoption of various technologies, and spurred by the emergence of the pandemic, now must encircle new cloud applications, remote employees, mobile devices, hybrid cloud environments etc, as outlined below:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8663ba1-c9b5-4acc-9cff-2322b40dc9a7_798x378.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8663ba1-c9b5-4acc-9cff-2322b40dc9a7_798x378.png" width="798" height="378" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c8663ba1-c9b5-4acc-9cff-2322b40dc9a7_798x378.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:378,&quot;width&quot;:798,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8663ba1-c9b5-4acc-9cff-2322b40dc9a7_798x378.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8663ba1-c9b5-4acc-9cff-2322b40dc9a7_798x378.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8663ba1-c9b5-4acc-9cff-2322b40dc9a7_798x378.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8663ba1-c9b5-4acc-9cff-2322b40dc9a7_798x378.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">The New Perimeter Graphic</figcaption></figure></div><p>In general the more endpoints that enter the trusted perimeter of a corporation, the more data that is sensitive/mission-critical in nature ends up being stored on said endpoints, thus the more capable the endpoint protection must be. An additional phenomena that should be accounted for is the rise of Zero-Trust architecture. Traditional perimeter network security, of which I have alluded to above, focuses on keeping attackers from breaching, but is vulnerable to devices that have already made their within and operate inside. Traditional tech such as VPNs, SIEMs, access controls, firewalls etc. build layers around the perimeter but have higher susceptibility to attacks. Zero Trust on the other hand is more secure and allows for interesting infrastructure modifications to be made. Working in the opposite manner, the architecture assumes the network has been compromised and thus constantly challenges users to verify that they are trustworthy. This architecture removes the need for the perimeter and doesn&#8217;t require server resources to be centralized, a design phenomenon that allows servers to become endpoints in themselves. Muji from Hyperrgrowth, in his excellent <a href="https://hhhypergrowth.com/flavors-of-security/">Flavors of Security Post</a>, which I highly recommend reading if you want a heightened understanding of Cybersecurity, outlines this fact nicely: </p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Zero Trust means NO PERIMETER, and hence, no EDGE gateways needed. Your server resources no longer need to be centralized, and can be scattered across any environment. What was edge compute becomes just another server or service. Every server becomes just another endpoint - so your network essentially becomes endpoint-to-endpoint. <strong>This layout dovetails nicely with using external SaaS services and cloud infrastructure, as those are just more endpoints.</strong> User devices will now talk directly to biz op services and database systems, regardless of where those live. <strong>Endpoint security becomes critical, and it must be layered directly with network security.&#8221;</strong></p></blockquote><p>The move towards Zero-Trust is not just a Silicon Valley buzzword. Rather, the United States government is also pushing for agencies to adopt Zero-Trust after a May 2021 executive order was signed in order to bolster the federal government&#8217;s cybersecurity [<a href="https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2021/09/biden-administration-releases-draft-zero-trust-guidance/185166/">7</a>]. Taking all of these points into consideration, it becomes clear that Endpoint Security has and will likely to become even more paramount to Modern Companies in the coming decade. </p><p>Zooming out, digital transformations are likely to continue to become more and more cloud-based, a phenomenon that will benefit companies with Cloud-native security solutions that have been enlisted to protect rapidly expanding breadths of endpoints.

Within a recent investor presentation, Crowdstrike outlined the fact that Cloud Security is likely not being allocated enough of total IT budgets, a happening that is likely to change as further cloud adoption occurs. Out of the $106.4B in total Cloud Spend that occurred in 2020, as estimated by the International Data Corporation, only 1.1% of this budget was directed at Cloud Security solutions, or $1.2B. If one takes the IDC suggestion for Cloud Security spend as a % of Total IT Budgets, a recommended 5-10%, and use these estimates in conjunction with the $217.7B 2023 Estimates for Cloud Spend, we&#8217;d arrive at a $12.4B opportunity using only 5.7% of the average IT budget.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless of whether these estimates will be 100% accurate or not, it is clear that there is a humongous opportunity for Crowdstrike to cater towards companies in a digitally transformative age, excel with the provision of Endpoint Security Solutions, and benefit from the overall acceptance of Cybersecurity as a whole.

The key differentiating factor between how Crowdstrike deploys their agents in comparison to the majority of competitors is the fact that only a single intelligent agent is required, working in conjunction with all of the company&#8217;s various capabilities. On the opposite end of the spectrum, legacy vendors usually require endpoints to install a different agent for each associated use-case, a burdensome happening that is net-negative with regards to both performance, UX, storage etc. At this point you may be wondering what exactly the agents on these endpoints do. In essence, these agents capture, analyze and relay data gathered from the various workflows of the endpoint, to other components of the security system. Kernel and user-mode modules go one step further with said data, consistently analyzing it and leveraging the power of local-situation models in order to dictate whether or not preventative/reparative actions are required for any threats an endpoint may face. As mentioned, data is relayed to other components of the security system for further analysis. The first component of note is <em>Threat Graph</em>, a cloud-delivered graph database. Graph databases are essentially a unique technique-driven manner of both storing and retrieving data from databases, with individual records being stored as nodes that are connected via vertices, representing a relationship between a set of unique occurrences, highlighting potential similarities/connections between attempted breaches that can be then used for preventative analysis, as examples. This tech segment also has additional features ranging from AI analysis, of which identifies new threats in real time, a search engine that allows threat responders to get info they need quickly, API functionality that allows threat graph to be integrated with workflows and more.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85cdccf1-2811-4dab-a4c8-208a0f8588c1_530x349.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85cdccf1-2811-4dab-a4c8-208a0f8588c1_530x349.png" width="530" height="349" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/85cdccf1-2811-4dab-a4c8-208a0f8588c1_530x349.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:349,&quot;width&quot;:530,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85cdccf1-2811-4dab-a4c8-208a0f8588c1_530x349.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85cdccf1-2811-4dab-a4c8-208a0f8588c1_530x349.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85cdccf1-2811-4dab-a4c8-208a0f8588c1_530x349.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85cdccf1-2811-4dab-a4c8-208a0f8588c1_530x349.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Threat Graph Graphic <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/big-data-graph-and-the-cloud-three-keys-to-stopping-todays-threats/">[9]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>These data techniques/functionality are further bolstered when one views them in conjunction with both <em>Falcon XDR</em> and <em>Humio</em>. Starting off with the former, this platform functionality was announced in October of this year and essentially extends the company&#8217;s current EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) capabilities. In essence, this functionality will leverage usage data it is receiving from various endpoints and act on potential threats in real-time before they become costly breaches. XDR (Extended Detection and Response) takes it one step further, ingesting an array of telemetry (i.e. data from a wide variety of communication sources such as IaaS and SaaS data sources), which, when combined with AI and ML techniques, can be used to both expedite and extend preventative action across the security stack. Moving over to the latter, Humio is a platform that was acquired by Crowdstrike, of which offers industry-leading log management, market-leading data compression techniques, useful and expedient search capabilities, which then results in a higher degree of observability across security teams. When one thinks about the fact that on average, a typical endpoint generates approximately 100 Gb of unfiltered system event data per day, as well as the fact that a modern corporation will contain thousands of endpoints, the ability to compress data in an effective manner and leverage it for preventative analysis will be extremely valuable to say the least. <em>Falcon Fusion </em>works to automate complex workflows, leveraging the power of the cloud in order to provide machine guided remediation and accelerated response times, allowing security teams to handle both the expanding complexity and attack surface of their associated enterprise. As an example, if a certain endpoint attack/usage occurrence were to occur, <em>Falcon Fusion </em>can be used to trigger a workflow rather than requiring a traditional manual/monotonous process. Further illustration of this tech in action can be seen outlined below:&nbsp;</p><div id="youtube2-cwdf6tgjbyc" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;cwdf6tgjbyc&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cwdf6tgjbyc?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>With all of these platform components in mind, we can now delve into Crowdstrike&#8217;s modules, of which can be thought of as cloud offerings that give customers differing functionality, depending on the security niche they would like protection/services for. Crowdstrike has modules contained within the following subcategories: Endpoint Security, Cloud Security, Managed Services, Security &amp; IT Operations, Threat Intelligence, Identity Protection, Long Management and Crowd XDR.

Over the last few fiscal years, Subscription Revenue has become almost the sole constituent of Total Revenues, an encouraging factor given that subscriptions oftentimes converted into a reliable and abundant source of Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR). </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5ac233e-f354-4858-b5e7-eaa33c428cb8_361x216.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5ac233e-f354-4858-b5e7-eaa33c428cb8_361x216.png" width="361" height="216" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b5ac233e-f354-4858-b5e7-eaa33c428cb8_361x216.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:216,&quot;width&quot;:361,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5ac233e-f354-4858-b5e7-eaa33c428cb8_361x216.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5ac233e-f354-4858-b5e7-eaa33c428cb8_361x216.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5ac233e-f354-4858-b5e7-eaa33c428cb8_361x216.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5ac233e-f354-4858-b5e7-eaa33c428cb8_361x216.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Change in Revenue Distribution by Segment</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Cost of Revenue</em></p><p>Cost of Revenue, of which consists primarily of the costs of hosting the company&#8217;s cloud services, SBC and salaries related to associated employees, came in at approximately $271M for FY&#8217;22*, representing a 66% increase YoY, increasing relatively in-line with its Revenue Counterpart.

One can ponder whether or not the red-hot industry in cybersecurity as well as word-of-mouth phenomena between large industry clients and their peers using Crowdstrike&#8217;s services have aided in the reduction of relative sales efforts but regardless, operational efficiencies in these areas are evident.

McAfee, despite being one of the first legacy operators to recognize this trend, does not instill confidence in me in their technological capabilities. Not only did McAfee sell their Enterprise segment to a PE firm, but their tech cannot keep up. With centricity around on-prem and local machine deliveries, oftentimes requiring endpoint downtime to install and update software, burdensome sensor CPU usage and more,  the associated UX  and functionality is inferior to the Falcon Platform. Symantec (Broadcom) solutions require multiple agents which themselves require multiple management consoles, and essentially mandate opt-in into their EDR and DeepSight intelligence modules in order for users to be able to derive any intelligence/response capabilities out of their tech. Trend Micro users suffer from similar drawbacks, with deep-dives into user reviews reflecting the fact that these technologies and their reliance on multiple agents across different environments are dreadfully burdensome on performance:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c4291f7-c89a-403a-828c-2bcd12761352_626x243.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c4291f7-c89a-403a-828c-2bcd12761352_626x243.png" width="626" height="243" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5c4291f7-c89a-403a-828c-2bcd12761352_626x243.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:243,&quot;width&quot;:626,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c4291f7-c89a-403a-828c-2bcd12761352_626x243.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c4291f7-c89a-403a-828c-2bcd12761352_626x243.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c4291f7-c89a-403a-828c-2bcd12761352_626x243.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c4291f7-c89a-403a-828c-2bcd12761352_626x243.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Trend Micro &#8594; Crowdstrike Transition Testimonial </figcaption></figure></div><p>In my opinion, two of the largest sources of competition are and will continue to be SentinelOne and Microsoft. Starting off with former, Sentinel One is one of the youngest next-generation AV and endpoint protection centered companies there is today. With rapid customer growth, a product line that has been toted as best in-class and ever-improving fundamentals, there has been a plethora of conversation regarding the competitive threat the company poses. Delving deeper into a side-by-side comparison, and starting off with the fundamentals, despite showing a higher Revenue CAGR from FY&#8217;20A to FY&#8217;22* (the first 9 months of 2021), i.e. 44.41% in comparison to 28.46%, Crowdstrike is operating with a Top-Line that is almost 10X the size of Sentinel One&#8217;s, all while bolstering superior Gross Margins, more efficient S&amp;M efforts as gauged by S&amp;M relative to Revenue etc., much better Operating and FCF Margins and higher-magnitude KPIs, as outlined by the table below:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6266c0e-1c69-44b5-92e3-f8f0511631f2_469x363.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6266c0e-1c69-44b5-92e3-f8f0511631f2_469x363.png" width="469" height="363" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b6266c0e-1c69-44b5-92e3-f8f0511631f2_469x363.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:363,&quot;width&quot;:469,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6266c0e-1c69-44b5-92e3-f8f0511631f2_469x363.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6266c0e-1c69-44b5-92e3-f8f0511631f2_469x363.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6266c0e-1c69-44b5-92e3-f8f0511631f2_469x363.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6266c0e-1c69-44b5-92e3-f8f0511631f2_469x363.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>In addition, SentinelOne, despite having a respectable DBNRR, has a much lower ACV in comparison to its counterpart. Analysts have been quick to showcase the growth in the company&#8217;s customer base, however, one must understand the fact that the company evidently caters towards a series of enterprises with a significant proportion of them being SMBs. As such, if ACV were to remain relatively low they will need to maintain a steady cadence of net customer additions to extract a similar level of value from this base as Crowdstrike. An additional titbit of analysis would be to compare the same metrics for the Fiscal Year prior to when Crowdstrike filed their S-1 (June 6th, 2019), to Sentinel One&#8217;s (June 21st, 2021).&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1061371b-969b-4afa-a0ee-fd5436a58175_321x363.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1061371b-969b-4afa-a0ee-fd5436a58175_321x363.png" width="321" height="363" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1061371b-969b-4afa-a0ee-fd5436a58175_321x363.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:363,&quot;width&quot;:321,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1061371b-969b-4afa-a0ee-fd5436a58175_321x363.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1061371b-969b-4afa-a0ee-fd5436a58175_321x363.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1061371b-969b-4afa-a0ee-fd5436a58175_321x363.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1061371b-969b-4afa-a0ee-fd5436a58175_321x363.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Again Crowdstrike operated at approximately 3X the scale, while exhibiting healthier Gross, Operating and FCF Margins, albeit having less customers at a similar point in their roadmap. In my mind, I would be more comfortable holding Crowdstrike at a slower growth rate (still a likely 40% Top-Line CAGR in the coming years) due to the higher-performance financials they are able to exhibit.&nbsp;</p><p>Moving on, SentinelOne may be exhibiting slight superiority when it comes to the product side of things. As we have previously discussed, Crowdstrike leverages modules, a strategy that packets different functionality into different add-ons so to speak that customers can opt into, if desired. SentinelOne, on the other hand, offers one fully integrated solution, of which is more affordable (hence the high # of customers with a lower ACV in comparison to Crowdstrike). Despite Crowdstrike&#8217;s platform possessing the ability to pinpoint a virus and &#8220;quarantine&#8221; it, as an example, the complete associated response and thus the key elimination of the threat oftentimes takes hours. On the other hand, Sentinel One combines their EPP and EDR capabilities into one XDR-solution, of which leverages AI that is capable of identifying and eliminating threats in fully autonomous manner, oftentimes in seconds, in comparison to the more analyst-driven and tedious solution with Crowdstrike. An <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4454383-why-sentinelone-is-better-than-crowdstrike">article</a> written by Convequity goes even deeper into the nuances of this head-to-head comparison, such as SentinelOne&#8217;s product scoring a better MITRE Evaluation rating, and should be read if you want a full knowledge base regarding this subject.

This powerhouse of a company has not only cemented themselves as a staple of the Cloud Infrastructure space, they have also become a significant player with regards to Endpoint Protection and other areas of Cybersecurity. The company has committed $20B to be spent over the course of the next five years to deliver more advanced cybersecurity tools, has over 650,000 different clients, recently reported $15B in revenue in this business segment, of which represents a Net Add of approximately $4.7B on the year. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the company has also been subject to some scrutiny due to the cybersecurity breaches that effected their own infrastructure over the course of 2021. I have a hard time betting against Microsoft. Taking excel as an example, this piece of software has become the most popular programming language in the world, a phenomenon that may not be testament to its existence as a best in-class product, despite its usefulness, but rather their ability to consistently intertwine themselves with the modern enterprise. As such, I find it highly likely that the company is able to leverage their network, so to speak, to become of the most prevalent players in the Endpoint Security and Cybersecurity space as a whole, seeing as they are one of the few vendors that have offerings for multiple end-markets. Being that as it may, only time will tell.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, private markets are starting to see an extreme bump in activity. In comparison to 2016, the number of VC backed Cybersecurity deals has almost tripled, as outlined below:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8204334d-a486-411c-bd96-e0556a5f1678_768x564.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8204334d-a486-411c-bd96-e0556a5f1678_768x564.png" width="448" height="329" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8204334d-a486-411c-bd96-e0556a5f1678_768x564.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:564,&quot;width&quot;:768,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:448,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8204334d-a486-411c-bd96-e0556a5f1678_768x564.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8204334d-a486-411c-bd96-e0556a5f1678_768x564.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8204334d-a486-411c-bd96-e0556a5f1678_768x564.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8204334d-a486-411c-bd96-e0556a5f1678_768x564.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Change in VC-Backed Cybersecurity Deals <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/cybersecurity-startup-acquisition-deals-funding-2021/">[14]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Regardless of whether or not ideal macroeconomic conditions have spurred easy access to capital, or if the tailwinds in the sector as a whole has resulted in more interesting parties trying to get their piece of the pie, it is worth taking note of, especially since more than an estimated $20B flew into these startups last year.&nbsp;</p><p>Of additional note, and something I don&#8217;t see many analysts discussing when it comes to the competitive dynamics of the industry, and Crowdstrike&#8217;s position within it, is the company&#8217;s CEO George Kurtz. Not only does the man posses almost 3 decades of experience within the cybersecurity industry, having excelled in former powerhouses of the legacy variety, i.e. McAfee, he also demonstrates a clear and deep understanding of the customer-first mentality that is required both to obtain and retain customers in a very competitive marketplace. As an example, when the company IPO&#8217;d in 2019, instead of celebrating the monumental achievement, he decided to spend the next 100 days meeting with 100 of the company&#8217;s clients. Kurtz was adamant that <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/crowdstrike-ceo-kurtz-top-cybersecurity-crime-fighter/">[15]</a>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>"Everything comes down to retention rates, and we have extremely high retention rates," he said. &nbsp;"I learned if you take care of the client, everything else takes care of itself, we'll do whatever it takes to make a customer happy. I can't promise perfection, but I can promise my response. And my response is to make sure the problem is solved and the customer is happy."</p></blockquote><p>Looking at the company&#8217;s continual expanding ARR and DBNRR metrics, it is evident that this customer-first approach has been successful and will likely continue to be a driving factor between Crowdstrike&#8217;s growth in the future alongside stellar product functionality.&nbsp;</p><p>Outside of Endpoint Security, Cybersecurity exists as an industry with an abundance of high-quality businesses that are catering toward different use-cases and end markets. One of the first questions one may encounter is how exactly does Crowdstrike compare against these entities valuation-wise? Starting off with Top-Line valuations relative to 2020A-2023E Revenue CAGR, Crowdstrike stands out as one of the highest valued and fastest-growing companies as outlined below:&nbsp;</p><div

I believe it is best that I summarize all of these ideas into a conclusive statement of sorts, of which I believe will be able to successfully encompass most of the factors an investor should consider when delving into Crowdstrike. First off the Endpoint Security Market is ripe for disruption. With legacy players still possessing substantial marketshare despite  having inferior tech, there is a ton of opportunity for Crowdstrike to continue to grow in the future. Being that as it may, there are developments that should be paid attention to. SentinelOne is a fast growing company that is arguably addressing the shortcomings of Crowdstrike&#8217;s technology and Microsoft is leveraging an abundance of enterprise connections to gain a significant portion of market share. In addition, there are Private-Market players and substantial VC funding flowing around that will likely result in competitive forces outside of these publicly traded counterparts. With all of that in mind, we can take Crowdstrike&#8217;s heavy focus on customer satisfaction, capable but potentially not best-in-class tech, and arrive at the conclusion that they are likely to end up in neither a winner take-all or winner take most scenario, but rather grow in a considerable manner alongside its peers. I have no problem underwriting a sustained 30% top-line CAGR for at least 5 years and with ever-improving margins it is likely Crowdstrike generates significant value for shareholders in the periods to come. Crowdstrike&#8217;s metrics show no sign of waning to competitive pressures, therefore, for the time being I will stand by these assertions until the numbers prove me otherwise. Despite not being a shareholder at the moment Crowdstrike served itself as an excellent entry point into the ecosystem for me and I will be monitoring the company alongside additional developments in the coming quarters.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>8.0 Conclusion</strong></p><p>In summary, Crowdstrike presents itself as one of the forefront contenders for capitalizing on happenings within an industry ripe for disruption. With capable tech, great financials and no sign of slowing down anytime soon, Crowdstrike is a great company. I hope this research served as a capable starting point to your evaluation of Crowdstrike and Cybersecurity as a whole. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02d5e8dd-0745-464b-a76e-bc315fa70bf2_300x168.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02d5e8dd-0745-464b-a76e-bc315fa70bf2_300x168.png" width="300" height="168" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/02d5e8dd-0745-464b-a76e-bc315fa70bf2_300x168.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:168,&quot;width&quot;:300,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;The Best and Funniest Security Memes | AT&amp;amp;T Cybersecurity&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="The Best and Funniest Security Memes | AT&amp;amp;T Cybersecurity" title="The Best and Funniest Security Memes | AT&amp;amp;T Cybersecurity" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02d5e8dd-0745-464b-a76e-bc315fa70bf2_300x168.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02d5e8dd-0745-464b-a76e-bc315fa70bf2_300x168.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02d5e8dd-0745-464b-a76e-bc315fa70bf2_300x168.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02d5e8dd-0745-464b-a76e-bc315fa70bf2_300x168.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Meme of the Day</figcaption></figure></div><p>If you enjoyed this research piece, please give it a like, subscribe and share!</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://mtcapital.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://mtcapital.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://mtcapital.substack.com/p/mondaycom-mndy?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyMzI2NTg2MCwicG9zdF9pZCI6NDQ1MTg0MjgsImlhdCI6MTYzOTA1ODA5MiwiaXNzIjoicHViLTM0NzkwNyIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.BWllDVCFl6lAF3oURloHuGLVDiCvRljOR9PsEp88l_I&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://mtcapital.substack.com/p/mondaycom-mndy?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyMzI2NTg2MCwicG9zdF9pZCI6NDQ1MTg0MjgsImlhdCI6MTYzOTA1ODA5MiwiaXNzIjoicHViLTM0NzkwNyIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.BWllDVCFl6lAF3oURloHuGLVDiCvRljOR9PsEp88l_I"><span>Share</span></a></p><p>If you want to see more frequent investing-related content, give me a follow on twitter @MT_Capital1.

Delving deeper, the fox is often described as a crafty being with flashy habits and a sleek demeanour, whereas the hedgehog is a simpler creature, sticking to a set of purposes/principles, usually coming out on top when the two clash. Applied to the world of tech, and nicely outlined in an Altos Ventures <a href="https://altos.vc/blog/foxes-and-hedgehogs">blog post</a>, despite the fact that fox style-CEOs may be better with acquiring funding, networking etc. hedgehogs on the other hand are able to measure and track everything about their business, often demonstrating deep levels of knowledge and expertise. Leveraging this single-minded mentality may be risky at times, however, it is often a toolset that allows a company to survive the many peaks and troughs of being a fast-moving company. David Baszucki and his late co-founder Erik Cassel, demonstrated a hedgehog mentality in both the creation and the continual operation of Roblox. The pair originally worked together in the late 1980s on a physics simulation engine known as Interactive Physics, a tool that was geared at helping students gain heightened understandings of the science, despite later being acquired by MSC Software in 1998 for more industrial purposes. Post-acquisition the pair bounced around, eventually coming back together in 2004 when DynaBlocks, the early prototype of Roblox was being worked on. Taking the origin stories of these ventures, and pairing them with the general definition for the hedgehog mentality, it is clear when one starts to delve into the technology, operations and mission of Roblox as a whole, that the mission of the founders was to create a memorable and enjoyable platform experience for children, one that not only immerses them in an interactive social landscape, but also teaches them skills ranging from basic commerce principals, to learning how to program in order to develop Roblox games. The Roblox platform is arguably one of the first instances of a Metaverse that has been completely immersed in pop culture and exists as three main components: Roblox Client, an application that allows for users to explore and play games within 3D digital worlds; Roblox Studio, a toolset that allows for users to develop, create and publish their own 3D experiences and content; and Roblox Cloud, the infrastructure powers the aforementioned platform and functionality.&nbsp;This company is still driven by the same hedgehog that it was co-founded by; arguably one of the main driving factors between past success, platform innovations, and likely a major contributing factor between the company&#8217;s continual future success. </p><p>With this brief description of Roblox in mind, let&#8217;s delve deeper into the main tailwinds and technological happenings that the company aims to benefit from within their operations and growth initiatives.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>2.0 Opportunity&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In order to understand the opportunity in front of Roblox it is important that we understand the scale of Gaming as a whole. According to Limelight Network&#8217;s 2021 State of Online Gaming report, gamers spent, on average, approximately 8 hours and 27 minutes a week playing games, with the average hours per week split

recognition of the effectiveness of a key component of Roblox&#8217;s business model. More specifically, Roblox and many other games provide users with in-game currency, of which they can use to unlock additional functionality, customize their characters etc. When comparing the % of of Gaming Revenue from In-Game Purchases to the % of Revenue from Premium Games at the start of decade to the end of the decade, it is evident companies and game developers have changed their monetization models towards in-game purchases, a phenomenon that is likely to continue to result in a user comfortability with Roblox&#8217;s business model. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67c57386-49be-422b-bb7b-f42f312ea709_896x416.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67c57386-49be-422b-bb7b-f42f312ea709_896x416.png" width="896" height="416" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/67c57386-49be-422b-bb7b-f42f312ea709_896x416.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:416,&quot;width&quot;:896,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67c57386-49be-422b-bb7b-f42f312ea709_896x416.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67c57386-49be-422b-bb7b-f42f312ea709_896x416.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67c57386-49be-422b-bb7b-f42f312ea709_896x416.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67c57386-49be-422b-bb7b-f42f312ea709_896x416.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Video Game Monetization Trends <a href="https://ark-invest.com/big-ideas-2021/">[3]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>The ability to continue to benefit from positive tailwinds will be imperative to Roblox&#8217;s continual success. They have evidently experienced a net positive from the aforementioned trends, however they are still focused on expanding their reach. As an example, and looking at Mobile Spend, the company has mentioned explicitly that they are looking for interactive advertising methods that can be used to drive Average Bookings Per Daily User in the future, with David Baszucki, the CEO of Roblox voicing clear optimism with regards to this opportunity in the company&#8217;s most recent earnings call <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/roblox-corporation-rblx-q3-2021-earnings-call-tran/">[4]</a>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Advertising is an enormous opportunity. And at the same time, our vision for advertising is immersive. It's native. It's around high-quality experiences.</p><p>And over time, we'll be working on rolling out the standards around this, how this is supported globally. We do think there's an interesting and big future and at the same time, a very high-quality branded advertising-type future. So super, super optimistic about that.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>With App Annie estimating that total Mobile Ad Spend, as an example, reached approximately $240B in 2021, it is exciting to think about the amount of ad spend that one of the most popular mobile games in the world would be able to capitalize upon. </p><p>Lastly, I think it is worth touching upon the amount of Metaverse related-activity we&#8217;ve seen of late, a phenomenon I believe is likely to benefit Roblox.

In a <a href="https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse">2020</a> blog post, Matthew Ball outlines quite an elegant definition that has formed a foundation for the framework I view these developments with. More specifically, the Metaverse can be described as a digital &#8220;jacked-in&#8221; internet, one that portrays a virtual reality/world of sorts that users would like to spend their time within, similar to sci-fi movie stand-outs such as the Matrix or Ready Player One. Ball continues to say that:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;The Metaverse is a massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds which can be experienced synchronously and persistently by an effectively unlimited number of users with an individual sense of presence, and with continuity of data, such as identity, history, entitlements, objects, communications and payments.&#8221;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>When one analyzes Roblox it is clear that their platform fits this definition almost identically. When a user connects with the Roblox platform they are exposed to a  3D virtual world, one that contains a wide array of different games and activities, a stunning amount of users that can be interacted with if desired, of which have been hard-pressed to stop growing in number since the company&#8217;s inception, a sense of presence with the ability for a user to customize their avatar in an almost endless amount of ways, and an in-game economy of sorts that allows for transactions to occur etc. With Metaverse-related ETFs being released, heightened media attention and a continuous desire for unique digital experiences, I believe Roblox is likely to continually benefit from these happenings.&nbsp;</p><p>In summary and despite the fact that I pinpointed my attention largely on mobile-game tailwinds, since I feel these are some the biggest opportunities the company can capitalize upon, Roblox has a clear opportunity in front of it with the growing screentime dedicated to video games, the general acceptance of in-game monetization game models that users have become comfortable with/expect, the amount of potential value to be extracted from in-game advertising, as well as the thirst for metaverse-level virtual immersion.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite barely scratching the surface here, let&#8217;s build atop this foundation and start to break down Roblox&#8217;s technology.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>3.0 Technology&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As previously discussed, the three main components of the Roblox Platform are the Roblox Client, the Roblox Studio and Roblox Cloud. Each of these components will be broken down within this section.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Roblox Client&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p>Roblox&#8217;s technology, much like other multiplayer video games, relies on a client-server model. In essence, this is a distributed application structure that spreads out the game&#8217;s various workloads across the entities that provide the service, i.e. servers, and the requesters of said service, i.e. clients. Applied to Roblox, the clients in this case would be the players, using their different devices, as outlined below, and the server would be the entity that allows for said clients to render the Roblox Universe.

To cement all ramblings, a illustrative TechInsider video demonstrating how one can make a simple Roblox Game can be seen outlined below:&nbsp;</p><div id="youtube2-PcEbSoSGioY" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;PcEbSoSGioY&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PcEbSoSGioY?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>There are a few points I would like to relay here, particularly regarding the dev-friendly nature of publishing games in the Roblox universe. First off, once a code-base has been created, it works seamlessly across every platform that Roblox supports, whether it be on a mobile device, computer, video game consoles or VR. Developers can then leverage the power of the social ecosystem omnipresent within Roblox, potentially allowing for their games to be put in front of millions of users through the achievement of virality, as well rest easy on the fact that engagement is likely to not be an issue given that billions of user engagement hours occur on the platform each month. In addition, games, once published, are intertwined with Roblox&#8217;s cloud infrastructure, which put simply, removes the complexity from maintaining multiplayer functionality, performing in-game updates or monetizing the content, if desired. Lastly, I think it is worth stressing the expansive array of information that new developers can immerse themselves in, a clear sign that the company evidently intends Roblox Studio to be both functional but also possess a learning curve that is approachable enough for an interested child. As an example, Roblox offers full tutorials to Learn Roblox Studio ranging from those covering the basics, delving deeper into coding using lua, and mastering how to manipulate visuals in-game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bd7266e-d436-42cb-8b8c-78f9b7111654_1425x844.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bd7266e-d436-42cb-8b8c-78f9b7111654_1425x844.png" width="1100" height="652" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5bd7266e-d436-42cb-8b8c-78f9b7111654_1425x844.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:652,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bd7266e-d436-42cb-8b8c-78f9b7111654_1425x844.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bd7266e-d436-42cb-8b8c-78f9b7111654_1425x844.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bd7266e-d436-42cb-8b8c-78f9b7111654_1425x844.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bd7266e-d436-42cb-8b8c-78f9b7111654_1425x844.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Screenshot of Roblox&#8217;s Various Developer Resources</figcaption></figure></div><p><em><strong>Roblox Cloud&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p>In essence, the Roblox cloud includes the services and infrastructure that powers the company&#8217;s platform. The cloud was a relatively new addition to infrastructure; an engineering choice that was made in 2017 in response to the fact that their dedicated servers at the time were unable to keep up, struggling with resource waste as a result of the company&#8217;s reliance on manual workflows and in-house tooling, all attempting to satisfy the needs of millions of users. In response to these challenges, Roblox leveraged the services of Hashicorp, a cloud infrastructure services provider, that essentially containerized the company&#8217;s game engine, upgraded their CPU to a Linux 64-bit version, and leveraged the Nomad platform to run double the workload on the same hardware, save money on windows licensing, and migrate application deployments from on-premise to in the cloud with AWS. Now, with user growth that has been hard pressed to slow down, the company can rest easy on the fact that their infrastructure will be able to keep up with the demands of modernity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With all of this information in mind, the Roblox platform comes together and offers users a series of value propositions, of which drive engagement and make Roblox a truly unique virtual experience.

More specifically, Roblox games can be played through a VR medium, with options ranging from a Burger Cooking Game, to entries such as Laser VR and Paranormica.&nbsp; Staying on the topic of compatible devices, the fact that the company supports users from all devices, whether that be those using Mac computers, to others trying to play on a playstation or android phone, promotes <em>low-friction </em>enjoyment, of which can occur <em>anywhere </em>in the world. Although cross-platform functionality is becoming more normalized in blockbuster game titles, there are still many instances where one&#8217;s gameplay experience is restricted to their console, which may exist as a deteriorative factor for user engagement, therefore I believe the above functionality is absolutely essential to the overall health of Roblox&#8217;s platform. At this point, I&#8217;ve already mentioned the fact that there are a vast array of games available to play on the platform, but the magnitude of these values are continually expanding, and quite astounding when analyzed. As of early January, it was estimated that there are over 40M games available to play on the platform, representing a true <em>Variety of Content. </em>Lastly, Roblox has a fully functioning economy that exists within its universe. More specifically, users can pay for certain components of games etc. within Roblox and developers can get paid out in in-game currency. This will be delved into in more depth in the next section, however, the economy is a key component to driving user and dev engagement and also pushing the company&#8217;s business forward. In summary, these features are all what make Roblox so special, and when viewed alongside the previously outlined Ball-criteria for a Metaverse, look pretty similar don&#8217;t they?&nbsp;</p><p>Now that we understand the company&#8217;s platform, how developers can create games for it, and the infrastructure that powers it, let&#8217;s take a look at how exactly Roblox makes money.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>4.0 How Roblox makes $$$</strong></p><p>As we&#8217;ve previously glossed over, Roblox has a fully functioning economy contained within its universe. As with any economy, having a form of money is of importance. This is where Robux come in, the universe&#8217;s in-game currency. What may be surprising to some is the fact that Robux actually satisfies the three constraints of what it means to be money, i.e. whether or not the currency is a store of value, a unit of account, and a medium of exchange. More specifically, a Robux approximately convertible to around $0.01 (USD), is a unit of account, i.e. the currency acts as a yardstick-esque device that can be used to measure the value of economic transactions occurring within the universe, and has value to both devs and users on both sides of a potential transaction. With that in mind, you may be wondering what exactly Users and Developers can do with these Robux. Starting off with users, individuals can purchase a set amount of Robux in order to obtain premium items for their Avatar, experience new things in-game, i.e. play premium games or purchase in-game bonuses etc.&nbsp;Users also have the option to subscribe to Roblox Premium, which essentially gives you a monthly stipend of Robux and offers a series of user benefits ranging from the ability to sell purchased items, receiving discounts on Robux and user-generated-content (UGC) item purchases, access to the trade system, which allows users to barter items between one another, and more. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca9baeda-7e9d-4ca2-b19f-96ac33fdacd4_959x423.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca9baeda-7e9d-4ca2-b19f-96ac33fdacd4_959x423.png" width="959" height="423" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ca9baeda-7e9d-4ca2-b19f-96ac33fdacd4_959x423.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:423,&quot;width&quot;:959,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca9baeda-7e9d-4ca2-b19f-96ac33fdacd4_959x423.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca9baeda-7e9d-4ca2-b19f-96ac33fdacd4_959x423.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca9baeda-7e9d-4ca2-b19f-96ac33fdacd4_959x423.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca9baeda-7e9d-4ca2-b19f-96ac33fdacd4_959x423.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Roblox Premium - Canada</figcaption></figure></div><p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, the developers earn Robux themselves from selling items they&#8217;ve created for Avatars, creating a game and requiring Robux to either pay for the game or get enhancements therein, etc/. In addition, developers get paid in Robux for developing engaging purchases. Roblox calculates payouts based on the share of time a premium subscriber spends within the experience. Lastly, developers can also create tools for fellow developers and sell those to peers in exchange for Robux within the studio marketplace. With both sides of transactions in mind, it is evident that Roblox has carefully constructed a dynamic economy that is fundamentally reliant on basic principles of network effects. Robux act as the grease in the metaphorical network effect wheel, keeping things turning as intended.

When Robux are purchased and used for spending within an experience, their are processing fees which amount to approximately 24.3% that must be directed back to the associated app store (i.e. Apple Android, Microsoft etc.) as well as the costs associated with making the payments using a credit card, paypal etc. An additional 23.1% is diverted to the costs of server maintenance and platform re-investments, and around 26.9% is directed to developers, whether that be for associated experiential transactions or engagement payouts. This leaves approximately 25.7% left for Roblox to recognize as Revenue.&nbsp; Outside of Robux Revenue, the company also makes money from advertising, licenses and royalties. Roblox makes money from advertisements, and charges companies that advertise on the platform on a cost per click or cost per thousand impression basis. Brands ranging from Disney to Warner Bros and Gucci have all advertised on the platform, showcasing the desire for big brands to target the platform&#8217;s demographics. As an example, Roblox created a virtual rendition of Washington Heights, the main neighborhood in the musical &#8220;The Heights&#8221; as a form of promotion. &nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50f62578-44ce-45d4-97d5-20e841803b9e_617x347.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50f62578-44ce-45d4-97d5-20e841803b9e_617x347.png" width="617" height="347" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/50f62578-44ce-45d4-97d5-20e841803b9e_617x347.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:347,&quot;width&quot;:617,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50f62578-44ce-45d4-97d5-20e841803b9e_617x347.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50f62578-44ce-45d4-97d5-20e841803b9e_617x347.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50f62578-44ce-45d4-97d5-20e841803b9e_617x347.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50f62578-44ce-45d4-97d5-20e841803b9e_617x347.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Roblox - Washington Heights</figcaption></figure></div><p>Given that Roblox&#8217;s main demographic is the younger generation, the company has also had success licensing by way of selling toys at select retailers.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea3d2419-1df6-4ad2-aa90-0cf3565e31fb_1500x834.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea3d2419-1df6-4ad2-aa90-0cf3565e31fb_1500x834.png" width="1100" height="612" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ea3d2419-1df6-4ad2-aa90-0cf3565e31fb_1500x834.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:612,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea3d2419-1df6-4ad2-aa90-0cf3565e31fb_1500x834.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea3d2419-1df6-4ad2-aa90-0cf3565e31fb_1500x834.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea3d2419-1df6-4ad2-aa90-0cf3565e31fb_1500x834.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea3d2419-1df6-4ad2-aa90-0cf3565e31fb_1500x834.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Roblox Licensing Example</figcaption></figure></div><p>Lastly, the company earns money from royalties.

The most noticeable adjustment, in my opinion is the company&#8217;s share-based compensation, which though important for aligning the values of employees with those of the company, can get carried away by companies sometimes. As such, the table below quantifies SBC, which, despite being relatively substantial, is not an adjustment that has been the sole driver of positive FCF in the last few years, an encouraging factor and indicative of the ability for Roblox to be able to spend and allocate capital towards platform improvements in the coming years.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fede28785-f8c0-4296-b6fe-f5b7c620f2d3_413x134.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fede28785-f8c0-4296-b6fe-f5b7c620f2d3_413x134.png" width="413" height="134" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ede28785-f8c0-4296-b6fe-f5b7c620f2d3_413x134.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:134,&quot;width&quot;:413,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fede28785-f8c0-4296-b6fe-f5b7c620f2d3_413x134.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fede28785-f8c0-4296-b6fe-f5b7c620f2d3_413x134.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fede28785-f8c0-4296-b6fe-f5b7c620f2d3_413x134.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fede28785-f8c0-4296-b6fe-f5b7c620f2d3_413x134.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><div><hr></div><p><strong>6.0 Key Performance Indicators&nbsp;</strong></p><p>One of the most important KPIs that one should pay attention to are Bookings, which essentially represent Revenue plus the change in deferred revenue that was recognized over the reporting period, or in other words the amount of Robux that have been purchased by users over a certain time frame.

As such, I will be monitoring this Q4 value to see if ABPDAU will reach a heightened sense of normalcy as the short-term pandemic benefits start to fizzle out:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67d190f5-a154-4f37-a715-5662ad767e2d_360x216.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67d190f5-a154-4f37-a715-5662ad767e2d_360x216.png" width="360" height="216" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/67d190f5-a154-4f37-a715-5662ad767e2d_360x216.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:216,&quot;width&quot;:360,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67d190f5-a154-4f37-a715-5662ad767e2d_360x216.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67d190f5-a154-4f37-a715-5662ad767e2d_360x216.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67d190f5-a154-4f37-a715-5662ad767e2d_360x216.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67d190f5-a154-4f37-a715-5662ad767e2d_360x216.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Change in ABPDAU</figcaption></figure></div><p>Lastly, Roblox is evidently focused on International expansion.

Starting off with the age demographic of Roblox, there have been many a critique pondering the fact that Roblox&#8217;s main target demographic is the younger generation, particularly those under 13. These users are evidently engaged, however, their ability to generate substantial and consistent ABPDAU growth may be hindered due to the limited financial means they have at their disposal. Being that as it may, there have been some meaningful developments in the amount of DAUs attributable to the Over 13 years old cohort, with a clear trend of older users engaging with Roblox&#8217;s platform in a noticeable manner corroborated below:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2746f1ab-ba86-4f5e-a6d5-5fd705d8cdca_360x216.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2746f1ab-ba86-4f5e-a6d5-5fd705d8cdca_360x216.png" width="360" height="216" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2746f1ab-ba86-4f5e-a6d5-5fd705d8cdca_360x216.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:216,&quot;width&quot;:360,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2746f1ab-ba86-4f5e-a6d5-5fd705d8cdca_360x216.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2746f1ab-ba86-4f5e-a6d5-5fd705d8cdca_360x216.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2746f1ab-ba86-4f5e-a6d5-5fd705d8cdca_360x216.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2746f1ab-ba86-4f5e-a6d5-5fd705d8cdca_360x216.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Change in Age Distribution - DAUs</figcaption></figure></div><p>Put simply, older users interacting with Roblox&#8217;s platform are likely to spend more, therefore I will continue to closely to monitor this distribution alongside ABPDAU to see if these assertions hold up over a longer period of time. Another growth lever that the company is making use of is International Expansion. In the KPI section of this report, I outlined the fact that the company has made commendable progress in expanding their reach outside of North America, growing noticeably in the UK, APAC and the Rest of the World. Expansion into China is particularly important, given both the size and likely engagement patterns that said user base exhibits. In July Roblox launched a Chinese version of their mobile app, LuoBluLeSi, of which was published and operated by Tencent, an agreement that originated as a result of a partnership between the two companies. In December of 2021, this app was taken down from mainland app stores, an action that was deemed part of the company&#8217;s iterative process to expand properly into China, with a Roblox spokesperson <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/roblox-transition-china-luobulesi-tencent/">stating</a>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>"It is critical that we now make the necessary investments, including investments in our data architecture, in order to realize our long-term vision."</p></blockquote><p>This roadblock, though a nuisance, is likely one of the many steps and headwinds the company will need to deal with when expanding into this region, and should be monitored by investors seeing as it is a big part of Roblox&#8217;s expansion efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>To get a little more speculative, it is worth pondering how Roblox&#8217;s platform can be integrated with the red-hot NFT space, an effort I don&#8217;t think is too far fetched given the parallels that can be drawn between the nature of Roblox&#8217;s platform and the crypto realm as a whole. To an extent, this has already been done within certain components of the Roblox Platform. As an example, PlayDapp, a blockchain service platform, has already launched their own blockchain-based metaverse, PlayDapp Land on the Roblox platform.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbbbae9f7-e45b-430a-a26b-2cd90682b39a_696x390.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbbbae9f7-e45b-430a-a26b-2cd90682b39a_696x390.png" width="696" height="390" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bbbae9f7-e45b-430a-a26b-2cd90682b39a_696x390.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:390,&quot;width&quot;:696,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbbbae9f7-e45b-430a-a26b-2cd90682b39a_696x390.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbbbae9f7-e45b-430a-a26b-2cd90682b39a_696x390.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbbbae9f7-e45b-430a-a26b-2cd90682b39a_696x390.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbbbae9f7-e45b-430a-a26b-2cd90682b39a_696x390.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">PlayDapp Land Graphic</figcaption></figure></div><p>Within, a social community can be enjoyed, items can be shopped for, mini-games can be played, etc. but, even more importantly, users can meet avatars that embody PlayDapp&#8217;s NFT characters. In addition, the PlayDapp universe has a P2E (Play to Earn) model that allows for users to convert time and in-game effort into a digital NFT, all aimed at enhancing the associated experience. In addition, with big brands leveraging the Roblox platform to build their own metaverse of sorts therein, it is not unreasonable to think that they would also try to incorporate some form of NFTs into the mix. As an example, Nike launched their own world within Roblox. Denoted as NIKELAND, the company aims to use this space to cater towards Roblox&#8217;s user base and &#8220;turn sport and play into a lifestyle&#8221;. With the company&#8217;s efforts in the NFT space, i.e. how the company is directing resources at the ability to tokenize shoe ownership in a way that abides by the ERC 721 NFT Standard and is recorded on the Ethereum Blockchain, it is not unreasonable to think something similar could be incorporated with avatars etc. within NIKELAND. Regardless if these speculations come into fruition or not, I hope I believe there are a lot of potential directions Roblox can take in these areas. </p><p>Lastly, I would like to discuss what I believe makes Roblox a truly unique investment within the video game space. In comparison to traditional video game companies, each with their abundance of IP and respective value propositions, I believe Roblox has a leg-up from an investment point of view. When I was doing my research for this article, I came across an interesting 2020 twitter conversation where Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games, answered a question as to whether or not Fortnite was a game or a platform. His response was that Fortnite is a game, primarily, but with each and every update that goes into the game it moves closer and closer to becoming a platform: </p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1342697699179700224?s=20&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;@BertramwwC <span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@maybebullish</span> <span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@mkobach</span> Fortnite is a game...primarily.

There is no doubt that games like Fortnite have transcended into pop culture. As examples, Fortnite released Dune skins near the peak of the iconic movie; Balenciaga teamed up with Fortnite to create a series of in-game outfits and a physical apparel line and much more. Being that as it may, I still do not believe these features come anywhere closed to the platform that Roblox has built. Outside of having millions of engaged fans pouring billions of hours of engagement time into the platform each year, there exists as a real opportunity for developers to engage with the universe. The company dishes out hundreds of millions of dollars each year to devs creating content on the platform, with specific instances of creators like Alex Balfanz, the co-designer of the hit Roblox game jailbreak, netting <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/23/college-student-video-game-creator-made-millions-from-jailbreak.html">7-figure profits</a> for their contribution to the universe. These examples highlight the fact, to me, that the company offers an irrefutable value proposition to both the user-side and developer-side of their ecosystem, an occurrence that sets Roblox out from the pack and is likely to continue to drive Roblox&#8217;s success in the space. </p><div><hr></div><p><strong>9.0 Conclusion </strong></p><p>If you were to take one thing away from reading this research I hope it will be the fact that Roblox is more than just a game, it is a platform. Captivating the minds and attention spans of the younger generation is no easy task, but Roblox has managed to do just that for more than a decade now. With strong financials, a reasonable valuation and a steady rate of growth that is likely to continue heading into the future, there is a lot to like here and I will be looking to start a position over the coming months.

In Amusing Ourselves to Death, a book written in 1985 by Neil Postman, the author delves deeply into how the rise of the most popular media, the television, has, and is likely to continue to affect levels of public communication, and the wellbeing of society in general. Brushing the implications of this message aside, there is no doubt that the rise of the television fundamentally altered the behaviour, habits and wellbeing of our species. This still rings true to this day, however, the rise of the internet and the simultaneous expansion of the prevalence of cell phones has shifted the power away from the television towards mobile devices. This assertion is corroborated when looking at the average screen time attributable to each type of device in the US, clearly showing mobile devices starting to reign supreme from 2019 onwards:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62ae5cd6-f0b6-4d69-b638-bf6a2d28e163_986x1024.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62ae5cd6-f0b6-4d69-b638-bf6a2d28e163_986x1024.png" width="554" height="575.3509127789047" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/62ae5cd6-f0b6-4d69-b638-bf6a2d28e163_986x1024.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:986,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:554,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62ae5cd6-f0b6-4d69-b638-bf6a2d28e163_986x1024.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62ae5cd6-f0b6-4d69-b638-bf6a2d28e163_986x1024.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62ae5cd6-f0b6-4d69-b638-bf6a2d28e163_986x1024.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62ae5cd6-f0b6-4d69-b638-bf6a2d28e163_986x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Screentime Comparison <a href="https://elitecontentmarketer.com/screen-time-statistics/#:~:text=A%20study%20of%2011k%20RescueTime,minutes%20on%20their%20mobile%20devices">[4]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Three further behaviour-related observations can be made.

Lastly, the real estate of a mobile device, so to speak, is precious. As of November 2021 it was estimated that there over 2.56 million different applications situated on the Google Play Store <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/app-statistics/#:~:text=The%20iOS%20App%20Store%20launched,we%20live%20our%20lives%20today">[5]</a>. Despite that fact, the average person has only 40 total apps installed on their phone, with 89% of total screentime being directed at only 18 of those apps <a href="https://www.simform.com/blog/the-state-of-mobile-app-usage/#:~:text=Normally%2C%20an%20average%20person%20has,of%20those%20apps%20remain%20unused">[6]</a>. With all of these factors in mind, one can draw the following conclusions. First, mobile devices are now the most important device in one&#8217;s lives as gauged by screen time. Second, the behaviour of mobile-device usage favors short visits, indicating that one is more so looking for something interesting on their device to happen rather than having an intended use-case conceived beforehand. Third, the pandemic has increased the magnitude of screen-time in youth demographics, a phenomenon that is observable in older groups and one that is likely not going anywhere anytime soon. Fourth, the screen space of a phone is valuable, with users showing preference to a select few apps when using their phones. This is where the realm of mobile advertising comes in, the evident staple to how Digital Turbine operates their business. Being that users are glued to their devices, so to speak, the amount of advertising dollars that has been directed to this realm has been astonishing. More specifically, Global Advertising Spend is anticipated to achieve a 12% CAGR between the 2021-2025 forecast period, with almost $540B in Total Spend anticipated to occur in 2025.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc799f4e-92c7-4298-901c-ba0f7b75c0d7_361x216.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc799f4e-92c7-4298-901c-ba0f7b75c0d7_361x216.png" width="411" height="245.9168975069252" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/dc799f4e-92c7-4298-901c-ba0f7b75c0d7_361x216.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:216,&quot;width&quot;:361,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:411,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc799f4e-92c7-4298-901c-ba0f7b75c0d7_361x216.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc799f4e-92c7-4298-901c-ba0f7b75c0d7_361x216.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc799f4e-92c7-4298-901c-ba0f7b75c0d7_361x216.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc799f4e-92c7-4298-901c-ba0f7b75c0d7_361x216.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Mobile Advertising Spend Projections <a href="https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_0a6c89c5ba235619fe0a431487c00c71/digitalturbine/db/297/3400/pdf/Investor_Presentation_May_2021.pdf">[7]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Although this opportunity is evidently large, it is worth differentiating the funds directed at the behemoths of mobile advertising, Google and Facebook.

Starting with iOS 14.5, iPhone changed the way adtech companies can access iPhone device identifiers, now allowing end-users to opt into whether or not they would like to share their data for ad targeting, a phenomenon that diminishes the effectiveness of advertising campaigns (lower ad targeting accuracy and relevance) due to a lack of prevalent first-party data. Sparing the monotonous details, advertising on Android has picked up steam since, evidently aided by the fact that Google has not changed their ad-targeting/data gathering practices. This assertion is corroborated when looking at a Signal survey performed in between February and June of this year, following the same timeline of tabooed iOS version release, which showcases Android ad spend as a % of total mobile ad spend of the surveyed parties gaining noticeable traction:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e3c8924-60be-47bb-b941-4eee41466d1f_468x414.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e3c8924-60be-47bb-b941-4eee41466d1f_468x414.png" width="468" height="414" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4e3c8924-60be-47bb-b941-4eee41466d1f_468x414.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:414,&quot;width&quot;:468,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e3c8924-60be-47bb-b941-4eee41466d1f_468x414.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e3c8924-60be-47bb-b941-4eee41466d1f_468x414.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e3c8924-60be-47bb-b941-4eee41466d1f_468x414.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e3c8924-60be-47bb-b941-4eee41466d1f_468x414.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">iOS vs. Android Ad Spend -

In essence, this rule is a recognition of friction, and the headwind-like properties that this phenomenon possesses. Applied to a Digital Turbine-specific scenario, advertisers spend substantial amounts of time and capital in order to get an end-user to see their application advertisement and potentially install it as a result. With traditional processes, tapping on an ad often leads to a multi-stage installation process, by where the user is redirected to a web page, then to the google play store etc., with ads and distractions often making their way in between these steps along the way. With each attention-grab there is a higher likelihood that the user just drops off and abandons their efforts. SingleTap fixes just that, instantly installing the app on the user&#8217;s phone as soon as they click on the associated ad. When combined with the synergies of Appreciate, a company acquired in early 2021 and now existing under the Digital Turbine banner, this technology is quite exciting. Appreciate is essentially a mobile app marketing platform, one that runs over 60B auctions a day and offers full control over the programmatic advertising ecosystem. Appreciate offers services and strategies tailor-made to the associated application and business model being advertised in order to exert greater control over the user acquisition, re-engagement, branding components of programmatic marketing, while also offering creative wizard tools that allow for multiple variations of ads to be created without time-intensive design team efforts. When combined with the friction-reducing impacts on advertisements that SingleTap results in, there is no wonder these two pieces of tech have been driving Digital Turbine business success, but more on that later.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Content Media&nbsp;</em></p><p>This component of Digital Turbine&#8217;s business is directly reliant on the functionality tied to Mobile Posse, a company that was acquired in March of 2020. This acquisition added three unique capabilities to Digital Turbine&#8217;s technological functionality, the ability to operate within and monetize the Home Screen, Discover Bar and Web Portal of associated Android Devices. Starting off with Home Screen, Mobile Posse&#8217;s technology allows for monetization to occur within the first app that is often encountered when using one&#8217;s Android Phone, often denoted as NewsHub or something similar depending on the device.

Although an entire deep-dive could be centered around this acquisition, it is best that we take a general overview approach to discussing Ad-Colony. The company&#8217;s specialities, and their associated value-add to Digital Turbine, are tied to their industry relationships as well as their technical capabilities in the video advertising space. Starting off with the former, Ad-Colony has relationships with companies ranging from Electronic Arts and Nintendo, to Amazon and Walmart, all of which, by association, will be able to spur Digital Turbine top-line growth as a result of their desire to advertise to end-users in a truly unique manner. Moving on to the former, Ad-Colony targets three core verticals with their technology: 1) Developers that monetize, 2) User acquisition and 3) Brand Advertisers. Through a focus on in-app video advertising (the company doesn&#8217;t target mobile web applications or social media), of which predominantly occurs within mobile gaming apps, the company utilizes their Instant-Play and Aurora technology to address said verticals. Instant-Play is Ad-Colony&#8217;s proprietary technology that allows for the load time associated with HD Video playback to be essentially eliminated, creating a seamless and responsive video advertisement viewing experience for the end-user.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ec14ad3-6d54-45d5-8892-21798d20f608_679x374.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ec14ad3-6d54-45d5-8892-21798d20f608_679x374.png" width="679" height="374" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7ec14ad3-6d54-45d5-8892-21798d20f608_679x374.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:374,&quot;width&quot;:679,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ec14ad3-6d54-45d5-8892-21798d20f608_679x374.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ec14ad3-6d54-45d5-8892-21798d20f608_679x374.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ec14ad3-6d54-45d5-8892-21798d20f608_679x374.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ec14ad3-6d54-45d5-8892-21798d20f608_679x374.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Instant Play Graphic</figcaption></figure></div><p>Moving on to Aurora, this technology leverages the aforementioned Instant-Play functionality alongside other features to create interactive video ad experiences.

On Device media is directly reliant on the partnerships that exist between the OEMs/Carriers and Digital Turbine itself. More specifically, any Revenue that is earned from either facilitating the download of mobile apps through pre-loads, single-tap and notifications, or through advertisements that made visible to the end-user through the various aforementioned Content Media mediums, of which is charged on a Cost Per Thousand or Click Basis, for Programmatic Ads and Sponsored/Editorial Content, respectively, is distributed back to the partners depending on the terms of their associated contract/agreement. In-App media on the other hand relies on the Revenue generated by AdColony and Fyber. Starting with the former, AdColony has two main sources of Revenue, those from the performance side of their business, which represents the percentage of the ad spend they generate from in-app advertisements as well as those from the publishing side of the business, of which contain exchange and direct-sold campaign fees that are generated when AdColony allows programmatic ad demand access to its inventory <a href="https://mb.cision.com/Public/1969/3296547/ab53916f77ee89f6.pdf">[14]</a>. Fyber generates revenue from their advertising sources, i.e. programmatic revenue (video and display) as well as non-programatic revenue. The company primarily makes money by taking a small percentage of ad spend when an ad transaction occurs on the Fyber Marketplace, i.e. when they provide their services to mobile developers and digital publishers to monetize their content.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>5.0 Financial Analysis&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This section will focus on delving into the key components of Digital Turbine&#8217;s most recent Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement in order to get a better sense of how the company is performing under the hood so to speak.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Income Statement&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p><em>Revenue&nbsp;</em></p><p>Revenue for Digital Turbine&#8217;s most recent reporting period (Q2 FY&#8217;22) came in at approximately $310M for the quarter, representing a 338% increase on a YoY basis.

This phenomenon is one of the main reasons why the company achieving meaningful sources of Recurring Revenue is so important. The company&#8217;s advertising opportunities across the entire lifespan of a device represent a much bigger opportunity and thus are more exciting for the long term trajectory of the company. Delving into the specifics, and initially spurred by the acquisition of Mobile Posse, Digital Turbine has been working on decreasing the amount of Revenue attributable to Dynamic Installs (i.e. one-off Revenue) and increasing Lifetime Revenues (Recurring Revenue).

Lastly, it will be important to track the amount of 5G compatible devices that will be rolling out over the next few years, seeing as the company will benefit in the video-advertising realm as a result of heightened network capabilities (think Ad-Colony and Fyber responding to increased demand). In total it is estimated, per CCS projections, that over 560M 5G compatible phones will sell this year. In addition, in the most recent Digital Turbine conference call it was disclosed that of the total amount of devices sold by the company&#8217;s largest US carrier partner, approximately 40% of them were 5G compatible. In short, the activity in this sector is likely to spur incremental increases in phone purchases if one wants to upgrade to heightened functionality as well as likely increases in ad-spend that will come with it.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>7.0 Valuation&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Getting down to the nitty gritty, Digital Turbine has experienced relatively significant multiple compression at a similar pace to its other Tech-Company counterparts over the course of the last few months.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46a59b17-9343-415c-bebb-62263ab7c377_1600x827.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46a59b17-9343-415c-bebb-62263ab7c377_1600x827.png" width="1100" height="569" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/46a59b17-9343-415c-bebb-62263ab7c377_1600x827.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:569,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46a59b17-9343-415c-bebb-62263ab7c377_1600x827.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46a59b17-9343-415c-bebb-62263ab7c377_1600x827.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46a59b17-9343-415c-bebb-62263ab7c377_1600x827.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46a59b17-9343-415c-bebb-62263ab7c377_1600x827.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Change in Valuation Multiples</figcaption></figure></div><p>Looking at EV/Revenue metrics may get the salivary glands of value-oriented investors going, however, one should take into consideration the how the company&#8217;s recent acquisitions have taken their GPs from the high 30%-low 40% range towards the low 30% range, thus using GP and EBITDA valuation metrics paint a more accurate picture of the company&#8217;s valuation.

This relationship evidently benefits both parties. For TikTok, since Digital Turbine has selected them as the video platform of choice, so to speak, they will evidently be able to leverage the company&#8217;s partnerships and pre-load capabilities to maintain a high degree of effective app distribution. For Digital Turbine, the company can yet again showcase the power of their platform and the fact that their technology&#8217;s capabilities will be very difficult to replicate. Tik Tok just surpassed Google as the most popular website in the world, further cementing the fact that this relationship is a feat in itself.&nbsp;</p><p>The most important development, arguably, is the mitigation of the Google risk. To give a little bit of background to those that may not be familiar with the situation, over the last few years Digital Turbine has been essentially operating at the mercy of Google. Being that the company has complete control over the Android ecosystem, they can, in essence, essentially stop a developer from working with or advertising on said operating system. To many investors, this was a huge risk and for good reason. If Digital Turbine fell out of grace with this behemoth then their ability to both generate Revenue on initial setup and across the lifespan of an end-users time with an android device would have been all but destroyed. On December 28th of 2021 this all changed for the better, with Digital Turbine announcing that they will partner with Google to drive its product and growth strategy for the Android Ecosystem forwards. Delving into the specifics, Digital Turbine will work with Google Cloud partner SADA to leverage a series of enterprise and cloud solutions in order to deliver both growth and monetization solutions for partners. When looking at what Rob Enslin, President of Google Cloud and Bill Stone, CEO of Digital Turbine had to say about the partnership, it is evident that this is both a tremendous growth opportunity and a risk that has been dealt with for the considerable future:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>"We are excited to partner with Digital Turbine to support the expansion and scale of its products and services globally," said Rob Enslin, President of Google Cloud. "Digital Turbine has been a longtime supporter of the Android ecosystem, and with this new partnership, it will utilize our advanced cloud and enterprise infrastructure to expand support of its value-added mobile experiences to end users around the globe."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"For the past 10 years Digital Turbine has helped expand the Android ecosystem with our intelligent app discovery, growth and monetization products supporting many of the leading Android app developers in the market today," said Bill Stone, CEO of Digital Turbine. "We are thrilled to further deepen and expand our partnership with Google. By partnering with Google we are efficiently&nbsp; powering app discovery for nearly a billion Android devices globally while simultaneously expanding our footprint across the Android ecosystem including mobile, TV and connected devices."</p></blockquote><p>We have spent considerable time within this deep-dive talking about the opportunity on Android mobile phones, but as Bill alluded to within the above statement, there is also an opportunity within other android-connected devices. As an example, AndroidOS has commendable presence within the SmartTV industry at almost 5% of total market share. This may not seem like a lot but when looking at the fact that there were over 665M different households with a SmartTV at the end of 2020, as well as the fact that this penetration is projected to continue at a rapid rate until 2026, this opportunity is not negligible.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"

Android Ecosystem. With commendable legacy operations now strengthened with multiple top-notch acquisitions, the company has built a moat that will be far fetched to encounter any meaningful competition. With all of this information in mind, I will end the deep-dive here. Hopefully this research provided you with a starting point to evaluate Digital Turbine.

I will aim to repeat this exercise on an annual basis, not only as an opportunity to gauge how far I&#8217;ve come but to also act as an inspiration of sorts for all of those that are considering starting writing, or acting on a dream/passion project.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p>For those that are not acquainted with me my name is Matt. I am a 23 year old native of Toronto, Ontario, Canada and am an engineer by trade. My journey to becoming a finance writer is nothing special, but is worth glossing over in order to understand a little bit more about who is behind the work getting sent to your inbox on a frequent basis. I&#8217;ve always been interested in writing, a curiosity that I would associate with my passion for reading. This personality trait, of which stems from my Mother&#8217;s substantial investment into ensuring I understood the power of the written word (hey mom), created an innate curiosity in myself that I believe only readers can truly understand. My newsletter-specific development originated in 2020, a period where I started to look deeper and deeper into the Stock Market. Spurred by an interest in the most effective ways to manage my own money, I consumed a variety of investing-related books and content that most are familiar with, ranging from Security Analysis by Graham &amp; Dodd, the Incerto Series by Nassim Taleb, to One Up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch. These endeavours blossomed into a full on obsession and, as luck would have it, I shortly thereafter stumbled across the Fintwit community. For the remainder of the year I stayed on the sidelines, reading the research and thoughts of some prominent accounts, slowly becoming more and more interested in the realm of Technology Companies. In April of this year I finally mustered up the courage to start creating some content of my own, releasing tweets with a respectable frequency and writing my first newsletter on Pinterest near the end of the month. Approximately 8 months later, I believe the version of myself that was hesitant to join the Creator Economy in April would be very proud of the progress that has been made. At almost 8000 followers on Twitter, I&#8217;ve grown a little community that I feel proud to interact with on a daily basis, I&#8217;ve engaged with respected Short Sellers, Hedge Fund Managers and Writers and I&#8217;ve made a group of friends that have been enormously supportive of my work.&nbsp;</p><p>Delving into the specifics of my Substack, over the last 8 months I have written 162,508 words and my pieces have amassed 97,165 total views, the equivalent of approximately two full-length books, as gauged below, all at a scale I couldn&#8217;t have dreamt of.&nbsp;</p><div

Starting off with the model of my newsletter service, I will continue to operate this for free for the considerable future. Viewing this as an investment in myself, I would like my work to reach the widest audience possible, something I feel is often hindered when research is published behind a paywall. I will switch to a paid model when the rate of growth has slowed in a considerable manner at a much higher scale (ideally 10,000+ free subs) and when I feel like I have built unshakable trust with my reader base. As for the content of my deep-dives, I believe I have settled into a groove writing about Technology Companies. With reference to the Deep Dive Stats outlined above, my most popular pieces have delved into Technology Companies that are extremely popular, but operate a business that is relatively complex in nature, i.e. Palantir, Affirm and dLocal, to name a few. I view the popularity of these pieces as an affirmation of what I am doing, i.e. releasing Tech Research that is understandable to the layman but also complex enough to add value to Institutional Investors. I will also be testing the waters with Tech IPOs this year, since I feel these are both under-covered on Substack and an undeniable value-add to the community.&nbsp;</p><p>Before parting ways for the remainder of 2021 I would like to discuss what I believe separates me from the pack of other writers. Many have stated that in order to be successful on Substack you must be the only one to do what you do, a statement I believe rings true in part, but has been predominantly false in my own experience. I am not the first writer to delve into the world of Technology Companies nor will I be the last. Despite that fact, I have reaped success thus far. I believe this phenomenon can be explained by two driving factors, the format/nature of my work and the work ethic that spurs it forward. Starting off with the former, I have structured all of my deep-dives in an extremely easy-to-digest format, with time being spent breaking down the company&#8217;s product/services in a way that can be understood by those with limited technical aptitude, while also providing analysis regarding financials and the driving KPIs of the business that is useful to someone that is already acquainted with said company. I will continue to structure my research as such. Moving on to the latter, I work harder than my peers. Although I do not come from a finance background, and thus will be hard pressed to provide the insight of an analyst that has years of experience under their belt, I am improving each day and I believe my recent piece on Coinbase in comparison to my first piece on Pinterest demonstrates exponential improvements. Therefore until I become a seasoned self-taught analyst, I will differentiate myself from my &#8220;competition&#8221; by putting in more hours and maintaining a content cadence I believe will prove very difficult to replicate.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, I would like to impart on you the following. Les Brown, a motivational speaker made an analogy that sticks with me to this day, something I have consistently reflected on at every stage of this journey and a heuristic of sorts that I use to keep myself motivated. I&#8217;m paraphrasing here but it goes something like this:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Imagine you&#8217;re on your deathbed - and standing around your bed are the ghosts representing your unfilled potential. The ghosts of the ideas you never acted on, the ghosts of the talents you didn&#8217;t use. They&#8217;re standing around your bed, angry, disappointed and upset. &#8220;We came to you because you could have brought us to life,&#8221; they say. &#8220;And now we&#8217;re going to your grave together.&#8221; How many ghosts are going to be around your bed when your time comes?&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>I believe my work thus far is 100 percent reflective of a man pursuing his dream, a man that has put his all into his craft and a man with an unshakable belief in himself. Regardless of the end result of this endeavour, I believe, when I am old and wise one day, that I will be able to look back at these efforts with pride, knowing that I put the full extent of my effort into building something great.&nbsp;</p><p>For my friends and family that have supported me every step of the way, thank you. For those that didn&#8217;t believe in me, had the opportunity to offer support but chose not to, or laughed off my efforts, thank you as well, you added fuel to my fire. With all of this mind, I wish you all a Happy New Year and look forward to delivering more top-notch content in January.&nbsp;</p><p>Matt from MT Capital Research.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p>This newsletter was brought to you by Heyday. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff04f6bcf-cc68-489a-b157-2c236962bdaa_1200x1070.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff04f6bcf-cc68-489a-b157-2c236962bdaa_1200x1070.png" width="1100" height="981" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f04f6bcf-cc68-489a-b157-2c236962bdaa_1200x1070.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:981,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff04f6bcf-cc68-489a-b157-2c236962bdaa_1200x1070.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff04f6bcf-cc68-489a-b157-2c236962bdaa_1200x1070.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff04f6bcf-cc68-489a-b157-2c236962bdaa_1200x1070.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff04f6bcf-cc68-489a-b157-2c236962bdaa_1200x1070.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><strong>Do you have 100+ browser tabs open right now?</strong></p><p>Give your memory a boost with Heyday so that accidentally closing them doesn&#8217;t feel like the end of the world.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://links.heyday.xyz/mtcapital">Heyday</a> browser extension is like cheat codes for your memory.&nbsp;</p><p>It automatically saves content you view and resurfaces it alongside your Google search results.</p><p><a href="https://links.heyday.xyz/mtcapital">Try Heyday today. </a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Coinbase ($COIN)]]></title><description><![CDATA[A Call Option on Crypto]]></description><link>https://mtcapital.substack.com/p/coinbase</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://mtcapital.substack.com/p/coinbase</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[MT_Capital]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 14:00:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/05dbc1e5-107c-45dc-b350-ceba12f1a156_800x462.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to <strong>MT Capital Research!</strong> If you&#8217;re new, join a group of <strong>3190</strong> Informed Investors who receive weekly reports on the World&#8217;s Most Interesting Tech Companies by subscribing below:&nbsp;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://mtcapital.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://mtcapital.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Today I will be completing an in-depth analysis on Coinbase, the crypto-centered company that has been a popular topic of conversation as of late.

Delving deeper, Coinbase believes that there is a new economy taking the world by storm, the Cryptoeconomy, of which can be loosely defined as a new open financial system built upon cryptocurrencies and technologies. With this definition in mind, Coinbase, in essence, is a corporation that lets both Retail and Institutional Investors alike interact with three main avenues tied to the Cryptoeconomy. These avenues include the provision of a platform for individuals to invest, store, spend and earn crypto, an online marketplace for hedge funds, money managers and corporations to interact with the space, and technological services that allow for developers, merchants and asset issuers to build applications that leverage various cryptocurrency-related protocols.&nbsp;</p><p>The company, founded by a former Airbnb engineer Brian Armstrong in 2012, has skyrocketed to a ~$55B valuation and represents an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a transformational trend that may alter the very fabric of our society as a whole.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that we have a brief understanding of what the company does, let&#8217;s take a look at the key trends and happenings they aim to benefit from, both within current and future operations.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>2.0 Opportunity&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In order to understand the value proposition of Coinbase, studying the possible use-cases of cryptocurrencies and technologies is inherently beneficial. First, it is useful to examine some shortcomings with Legacy Financial Institutions. In their S-1, Coinbase boils a complex network of issues into three main points: <em>Access, Efficiency </em>and <em>Cost. </em>In summary, these three factors encompass phenomena that is everpresence when interacting with today&#8217;s financial systems. More specifically financial infrastructure is often limited by geography or is not easily relied upon by all, there is often an undeniable presence of middle men and protocols that result in noticeable friction, and there are a variety of costs that must be distributed to different points of the network, all of which make for more unpleasant and inefficient end-user experiences. In order to cement these assertions it is worth discussing real-world happenings and potential use-cases where cryptocurrency may resolve these issues. When one compares the West with Certain Emerging Market and Developing Economies, (EMDEs), there is an evident disparity in the uniformity of the adoption of financial accounts, offerings etc. Despite improvements having been made of late, there is a lack of universality in the number of people in these locations that possess bank accounts, either as a result of their lack of usefulness/functionality, the inability to keep up with maintenance costs or not being able to pass the bank&#8217;s customer due diligence requirements. These regions also struggle with banking concentration, which in essence describes the fact that financial institutions in many EDMEs do not face ample competition and thus are free to mark-up services however they may please. These occurrences are problematic for those that do possess bank accounts. Many of these regions are heavily reliant on remittances to survive, as outlined by the lefthand side of the image below and with the average cost of sending money in these regions being approximately 7.5%, there is room for improvements.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b2d6ebd-c92a-4072-bb75-5ac52d2e461c_659x282.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b2d6ebd-c92a-4072-bb75-5ac52d2e461c_659x282.png" width="659" height="282" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2b2d6ebd-c92a-4072-bb75-5ac52d2e461c_659x282.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:282,&quot;width&quot;:659,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b2d6ebd-c92a-4072-bb75-5ac52d2e461c_659x282.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b2d6ebd-c92a-4072-bb75-5ac52d2e461c_659x282.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b2d6ebd-c92a-4072-bb75-5ac52d2e461c_659x282.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b2d6ebd-c92a-4072-bb75-5ac52d2e461c_659x282.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Remittance Statistics <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/work973.pdf">[1]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>The high level of adoptions of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins in these areas has evidently been a response to these inefficiencies.

Many like to tout the emergence of Web 3.0 as one of the driving factors behind crypto adoption, therefore we must understand its predecessors. Web 1.0 can be described as the first iteration of the World Wide Web, existing largely as a content delivery mechanism web pages were static, elements on the page were aligned using simple frames and tables and content was sourced from a server&#8217;s file system. The next iteration, Web 2.0 saw a heavier focus on both interaction and collaboration, with the encompassment of the change from static to dynamic pages, web-based applications, user-generated content and the growth of social media contained therein. Many describe the rise of Web 2.0 to be directly proportional to three layers of innovation that have taken our world by storm, i.e. the rise of <em>mobile, social </em>and <em>cloud. </em>Although these innovations are still coming into fruition, they have resulted in a centralization of data within the hands of big tech companies and as such have spurred what many believe to be the next paradigm shift into action. Coined as Web 3.0, this set of disruptive actions is thought to be a move in the direction of <em>open, trustless </em>and <em>permissionless </em>networks. In essence Web 3.0 should theoretically allow for software to be designed by developers in a way that makes it accessible and transparent to the rest of the world, leveraging blockchain technologies which can essentially be thought of as a distributed database/ledger that allows transactions and interactions to occur between peers without the verification of a third party, all while remaining permissionless, i.e. out of the hands of a central governing body <a href="https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b">[3]</a>. In an amazing Not Boring piece that details where Crypto fits in within <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game">&#8220;The Great Online Game&#8221;</a>, Packy refers to crypto as an in-game money for the internet, rewarding participation in the Web 3.0 ecosystem for users, builders, validators, stakers etc. I think this summarizes cryptocurrencies connection to the internet quite well and as more and more of our daily lives become rooted in the virtual, it only makes sense that there exists an asset that is native to the ecosystem. Rather than delving into whether cryptocurrency is actual money itself, i.e. the debate we have all come across of late that discusses whether cryptocurrency is a store of value, unit of account and medium of exchange (the three classic characteristics of money), I believe it will be of the most use to detail additional real-world use cases and adoption statistics to get a sense of just how big this opportunity is at the moment. First off, 2020 saw an explosion in crypto-related activity, a phenomenon which has been both carried into and vastly exceeded in 2021. A recent cardify survey corroborates this assertion, with crypto as a % of total retail investment deposits showing strong momentum and the average monthly deposit per crypto user trumping standard stock investing at the end of Q3, as outlined below:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0871b2d-c608-4767-91fd-1701b3feea74_1600x795.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0871b2d-c608-4767-91fd-1701b3feea74_1600x795.png" width="1100" height="547" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e0871b2d-c608-4767-91fd-1701b3feea74_1600x795.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:547,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0871b2d-c608-4767-91fd-1701b3feea74_1600x795.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0871b2d-c608-4767-91fd-1701b3feea74_1600x795.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0871b2d-c608-4767-91fd-1701b3feea74_1600x795.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0871b2d-c608-4767-91fd-1701b3feea74_1600x795.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Crypto as a % of Total Investment Deposits - Cardify Survey <a href="https://www.cardify.ai/">[4]</a></figcaption></figure></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf37b73b-e52c-4b99-b72f-f06ae6818d8b_1600x837.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf37b73b-e52c-4b99-b72f-f06ae6818d8b_1600x837.png" width="1100" height="575" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cf37b73b-e52c-4b99-b72f-f06ae6818d8b_1600x837.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:575,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf37b73b-e52c-4b99-b72f-f06ae6818d8b_1600x837.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf37b73b-e52c-4b99-b72f-f06ae6818d8b_1600x837.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf37b73b-e52c-4b99-b72f-f06ae6818d8b_1600x837.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf37b73b-e52c-4b99-b72f-f06ae6818d8b_1600x837.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Average Monthly Deposit Per User - Cardify Survey</figcaption></figure></div><p>Another gauge of this heightened activity is the number of Ethereum addresses.

Tokens can essentially be used to obtain fractional ownership in real assets. Companies have already started to complete Security Token Offerings (STOs), i.e. a process that allows individuals to obtain equity in the company on the blockchain, and there are some exciting opportunities for investments that were predominantly illiquid in the past (commercial real estate, private companies) now being made available to traders via STOs. Out of all the crypto applications, I am most hopeful in the ability for security tokens to democratize investing, providing the little guy access to portfolio allocations that were previously only available to institutions.&nbsp;</p><p>With all of these discussions in mind I would like for you to draw a few conclusions. First the activity in crypto is both stunning and, judging by the level of adoption and intertwinement with social trends and culture, may be hear to stay for the long run. In addition, and as previously asserted, the applications are vast and I have barely scratched the surface with regards to the amount of de-fi technology currently being circulated. Coinbase aims to be the logical first step for all things crypto. With a market-leading brand, a strict adherence to regulatory guidelines and requirements, top-notch security, an ability to act as a trusted custodian for crypto assets, and easy-to-use and functional technology, the company has definitely cemented itself at the forefront of the industry. Now that we know a little bit more about the activity in the crypto space, let&#8217;s start to break down Coinbase&#8217;s technology and see where they fit therein.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>3.0 Platform&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Coinbase&#8217;s platform can be split into three unique and distinct components according to the demographic that they are geared towards.

Users also have access to <em>Send/Receive</em> functionality which allows for any of the aforementioned crypto assets available on the Coinbase platform to be sent or received through transfers made between wallet addresses, phone numbers or email (if said communication method has a Coinbase account associated with it). Coinbase also supports on-chain or off-chain sends, with the former being  free and much more expedient in comparison to its counterpart.&nbsp;</p><p>Moving along to the <em>Save </em>and <em>Stake </em>functionality, this is where having some form of crypto presence gets interesting. With the former, users are able to earn yield off of their crypto assets and through other processes, if desired. Starting off with stablecoins, i.e. tokens that are pegged to the dollar, investors can earn approximately 2% APY holding DAI in their account or 0.15% APY using USDC. If this isn&#8217;t intriguing enough, users have the option to lend their crypto through Ce-Fi (Centralized Finance) or De-Fi processes, earning approximately 4% APY with the latter or&nbsp; anywhere from 2-7% APY using De-Fi protocols such as Compoundv2 or Aav, depending on what stablecoin is used for the lending itself. Lastly, users have the option to obtain a loan against their crypto holdings. In other words, individuals can borrow up to $1,000,000 against their bitcoin balance. Switching gears to the latter, staking can be described as a process where users lock up crypto holdings in order to obtain rewards or earn interest. In essence, certain protocols such as Tezos reward participants for validating blockchain transactions with their staked holdings and providing some form of reward/compensation accordingly.</p><p><em><strong>Institutions&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p>The functionality of Coinbase&#8217;s technology doesn&#8217;t stop at Retail. The company is evidently focused on becoming, as outlined within their S-1, the &#8220;one-stop shop&#8221; for institutions that are looking to gain exposure to the Crypto Economy. Starting off with the ability to <em>Invest</em>, Coinbase offers institutional clients access to one of the most liquid crypto spot exchanges in the world, as well as a host of different functionality ranging from market data, API access and analytics to order routing capabilities that allow entities to get the best prices on trades possible. Outside of the ability to <em>Send </em>and <em>Receive </em>and <em>Stake</em>, which functions in a similar manner for Institutions as it does for Retail, Coinbase&#8217;s storage capabilities are what have the highest value proposition in this customer segment, in my opinion. Cryptocurrencies have a uniquely inherent security risk that has proven a source of hesitancy for institutions to consider them as investments, i.e. they are accessible anywhere, which proves to be a double edged sword as they are thus able to be stolen from anywhere.&nbsp; Coinbase leverages cold storage, which in essence is a process by where cryptocurrency is stored offline, ensuring that the various on-chain addresses of institutions are not accessible by hackers via traditional means. <em>Custody </em>is both insured and regulated by SOC 1 Type II and SOC 2 Type II financial and security audits as well as able to be fully integrated with the company&#8217;s aforementioned trading functionality. The last feature worth noting are the credit offerings Coinbase gears at institutions. Outside of the traditional access to liquidity for hedging etc., the company offers post-trade credit, i.e. fund advancement that allows eligible customers to trade on credit rather than waiting for funds to settle a few days later.&nbsp;</p><p>Launched earlier this year, Coinbase also gears a fully integrated product offering at institutional clients, Coinbase prime. This solution provides secure custody, an advanced trading platform and prime services that allow for the easy management of crypto assets, as outlined by the product release video below:&nbsp;</p><div id="youtube2-7jksSU6JFD4" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;7jksSU6JFD4&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7jksSU6JFD4?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>In summary, Coinbase&#8217;s institutional offerings are leveraged by the biggest funds, financial institutions and corporations in the world and with their expansive feature offering is likely to remain a strong presence in this area.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Ecosystem</strong></em></p><p>Outside of catering towards both Retail and Institutional Investors alike, Coinbase directs substantial efforts at the betterment of the crypto ecosystem as a whole. Starting off with their <em>Earn </em>functionality, Coinbase provides crypto developers/technology creators with access to the millions of individuals on their platform to spread awareness. In essence, users that watch a video, download an app or complete a task to learn more about an asset will receive a set amount of that asset in exchange for their time. Moving on, Coinbase&#8217;s main, developer-friendly offering that I believe warrants bullishness over is <em>Coinbase Cloud</em>. Labelled as an effort to become the &#8220;AWS of Crypto&#8221; this offering offers developers a series of APIs and infrastructure to create decentralized applications, accept crypto payments, gain insights off of trading data, create infrastructure for staking and more. The seven main branches of <em>Coinbase Cloud </em>can be seen outlined below and despite no numbers being disclosed with regards to the amount of revenues attributable to the offering, the Cloud has approximately $30B+ assets staked across more than 25 protocols and 60,000 nodes to support all of the services on applicable networks, indicative of impressive size given the infancy of the offering:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49e45815-0741-4f40-8f10-3d75b942bf8e_882x681.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49e45815-0741-4f40-8f10-3d75b942bf8e_882x681.png" width="882" height="681" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/49e45815-0741-4f40-8f10-3d75b942bf8e_882x681.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:681,&quot;width&quot;:882,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49e45815-0741-4f40-8f10-3d75b942bf8e_882x681.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49e45815-0741-4f40-8f10-3d75b942bf8e_882x681.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49e45815-0741-4f40-8f10-3d75b942bf8e_882x681.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49e45815-0741-4f40-8f10-3d75b942bf8e_882x681.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Lastly, in a blog post made earlier in the year, CEO Brian Armstrong indicated that the company was amidst plans to launch a crypto app store of sorts, of which offers access to third-party developed products. Armstrong was adamant that the crypto economy is still in its early stages, and that with an expansive ecosystem there is likely to be a wide variety of defi centered applications built on the crypto rails, so to speak <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-reveals-plans-for-crypto-app-store-amid-global-refocus">[10]</a>. Drawing the following euphemism to how Apple didn&#8217;t build every app made for the iPhone, but rather made it open to third-party developers, it is exciting to think about the amount of value that could be extracted from an app-store centered around providing easy access to crypto centered tech.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that we have a better understand of what Coinbase offers, let&#8217;s take a look at how exactly they make money from all of it.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>4.0 How Coinbase makes $$$$</strong></p><p>Coinbase&#8217;s sources of Revenue, and thus how they make money from their platform, can be split into two distinct components, <em><strong>Transaction Revenue </strong></em>and <em><strong>Subscription and Services Revenue</strong></em>. The former encompasses fees charged to users for either Investing in, Sending, Receiving or Spending (using the Coinbase Visa Card). For Investing, Coinbase charges Retail Traders anywhere from 1-2.5% per transaction whereas on the Institutional Level the Exchange operates using a maker or taker model, charging individuals anywhere from 0.04% to 0.50% depending on the volume of the transaction. Using the Coinbase Visa Card is free for each transaction, however, if one makes any ATM withdrawals, there is a 2.5% fee. Moving over to the latter, this value encompasses four main components, i.e. subscription/services revenue associated with <em>Store, Stake, Distribute </em>and <em>Build </em>products. For <em>Store</em> Coinbase earns Custodial Fee Revenue which is dictated based upon the value of assets held in the company&#8217;s cold storage solution. For <em>Stake, </em>Coinbase charges a 25% commission for any staking rewards that are obtained using crypto held on Coinbase. <em>&nbsp;</em>Through <em>Distribute</em>, i.e. the Earn for learning functionality, Coinbase takes a commission based on the value and the amount of the crypto asset that has been distributed to customers. Lastly, Coinbase charges customers Licensing fees for any services that me leveraging within the aforementioned <em>Build </em>Offerings.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that we have a better understanding of how Coinbase makes money, let&#8217;s delve deeper into their financials.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>5.0 Financial Analysis</strong></p><p>This section will delve into the key components of Coinbase&#8217;s most recent Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement and make conclusions regarding the information contained therein accordingly.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Income Statement</strong></em></p><p><em>Revenue</em></p><p>Coinbase&#8217;s Revenue for Q3&#8217;21 came in at approximately $1.3B, representing a 316% increase on a YoY basis.

becoming more and more attributable to Institutional activity as the quarters go on. Although this makes sense, since these entities are trading with sums of cash much larger than their counterparts, an interesting phenomenon arises here. More specifically, despite being trumped by Institutions in terms of volume, Retail is the largest source of the company&#8217;s revenue given how transaction fee structures are set up. As such, retail centered product offerings will inevitably be of a greater value add to the company&#8217;s top line despite the increased institutional activity seen of late.

Starting off with centralized vs. decentralized exchange argument, many would like to tout that a DEX will eventually come and take Coinbase&#8217;s lunch, so to speak, which I believe is unlikely to be the case. In the United States, we already understand that Coinbase leads the way in this region and the company&#8217;s Spot Trading Volume clearly trumps any decentralized exchange, with Uniswamp being its closest competitor. Unless one is the custodian of their wallet, Centralized Exchanges essentially function by holding the crypto purchased on the platform within a wallet managed by the exchanged (centralized). Decentralized Exchanges differ in the fact that users maintain full control over their wallets, with wallets interacting with each other to trade crypto rather than relying upon the exchange as the middle man. As such DEXs result in two main advantages, security in the fact the one&#8217;s crypto is not in danger of being compromised when it is held by the exchange and sovereignty given the fact that users have control over their wallets. Being that as it may, Coinbase will still likely remain the logical first step for most Retail Investors (a phenomenon that is corroborated by Spot Trading Volume in the US) due to its inherent simplicity and ease of access. Though many proponents of defi would like to argue otherwise, managing your own wallet and buying and selling crypto through a DEX is an order of magnitude more difficult for the layman, a factor which I believe adds an extra layer of friction to switching from a centralized to a decentralized exchange. In addition, Coinbase&#8217;s platform has never actually sustained a breach or been hacked. User accounts have been exploited through phishing scams, however, the company&#8217;s platform itself is extremely secure and for this reason alone is trusted by the biggest institutions in the world for crypto custodianship. For these reasons I feel like the centralized vs. decentralized exchange argument doesn&#8217;t have much merit when applied to Coinbase.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, Coinbase must also must fare well against apps like Cash App and Robinhood. Using Cash App as a point of comparison, the app had almost double the amount of downloads in November than Coinbase.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a3cf8fd-a63c-4327-a9cb-e37d58c6bd40_899x127.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a3cf8fd-a63c-4327-a9cb-e37d58c6bd40_899x127.png" width="899" height="127" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4a3cf8fd-a63c-4327-a9cb-e37d58c6bd40_899x127.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:127,&quot;width&quot;:899,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a3cf8fd-a63c-4327-a9cb-e37d58c6bd40_899x127.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a3cf8fd-a63c-4327-a9cb-e37d58c6bd40_899x127.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a3cf8fd-a63c-4327-a9cb-e37d58c6bd40_899x127.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a3cf8fd-a63c-4327-a9cb-e37d58c6bd40_899x127.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fad5fd497-ec85-4333-aecc-78111164ba7d_902x130.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fad5fd497-ec85-4333-aecc-78111164ba7d_902x130.png" width="902" height="130" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ad5fd497-ec85-4333-aecc-78111164ba7d_902x130.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:130,&quot;width&quot;:902,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fad5fd497-ec85-4333-aecc-78111164ba7d_902x130.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fad5fd497-ec85-4333-aecc-78111164ba7d_902x130.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fad5fd497-ec85-4333-aecc-78111164ba7d_902x130.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fad5fd497-ec85-4333-aecc-78111164ba7d_902x130.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Cash App and Coinbase App Download - Sensor Tower <a href="https://sensortower.com/">[15]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>I think Coinbase differentiates itself well from other Fintech companies in the sheer volume of crypto offerings. With Cash App for example, the company suffers from being overshadowed by the Bitcoin Maximalism of Block&#8217;s (Square) Jack Dorsey. The company is even working on their own decentralized exchange, an effort I believe will prove futile if they are not able to expand their crypto offerings. If we look at the Coinbase&#8217;s Trading Volume Distribution by Crypto Asset, as previously discussed, there is a clear behavior trend in Coinbase&#8217;s users away from solely investing in Bitcoin to investments in Ethereum and Other Crypto Assets like Solana which have demonstrated benefits in terms of developer capabilities and transaction speeds, feats which Digital Gold is just not capable of. As such, I believe Retail Investors that truly want exposure to all avenues of the Crypto Space are likely to turn to Coinbase for these reasons alone.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, Coinbase is putting substantial efforts into differentiating the main drivers of their business. Mentioned earlier the company has evidently acknowledged the fact that their company is heavily reliant on Transaction Revenues. Although this concentration has been reducing slightly over the years, it is still extremely high. Generating meaningful subscription/services revenue is the logical direction and Coinbase is evidently focused on this area, especially given their acquisition-fueled Coinbase Cloud activity of late. The company has also rolled out Coinbase One, a product which for $29.99/month offers individuals zero trading fees, access to 24/7 support, and up to $1M in an investment protection of sorts. These efforts and other future ones like it will most definitely improve the health of Coinbase&#8217;s business and platform as a whole going forwards.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>10.0 Conclusion&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In summary, despite not being long Coinbase, I recognize the value proposition here. My main concern is with the company&#8217;s evident correlation to the behaviour of the crypto space in general, a worry that I will not be able to get over until I have completed more research into Web 3.0 as a whole. Being that as it may, Coinbase is valued reasonably, has top-tier management, has clear dominance in the US, is adding new products and crypto assets to their product suite and platform, and are no doubt focused on ironing out the kinks in their operations. As such, I believe Coinbase warrants the attention of investors. This research should have provided you with a great starting point for considering the company as a portfolio allocation and I thank you for reading it. Happy Holidays.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb22e32a8-2d48-467a-aa01-2fa87a0e05b0_680x382.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb22e32a8-2d48-467a-aa01-2fa87a0e05b0_680x382.png" width="680" height="382" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b22e32a8-2d48-467a-aa01-2fa87a0e05b0_680x382.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:382,&quot;width&quot;:680,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Happy holidays! : r/memes&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Happy holidays! : r/memes" title="Happy holidays! : r/memes" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb22e32a8-2d48-467a-aa01-2fa87a0e05b0_680x382.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb22e32a8-2d48-467a-aa01-2fa87a0e05b0_680x382.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb22e32a8-2d48-467a-aa01-2fa87a0e05b0_680x382.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb22e32a8-2d48-467a-aa01-2fa87a0e05b0_680x382.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">This Year&#8217;s Santa Rally</figcaption></figure></div><p>If you enjoyed this research piece, please give it a like, comment below and share!</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://mtcapital.substack.com/p/mondaycom-mndy?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyMzI2NTg2MCwicG9zdF9pZCI6NDQ1MTg0MjgsImlhdCI6MTYzOTA1ODA5MiwiaXNzIjoicHViLTM0NzkwNyIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.BWllDVCFl6lAF3oURloHuGLVDiCvRljOR9PsEp88l_I&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://mtcapital.substack.com/p/mondaycom-mndy?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyMzI2NTg2MCwicG9zdF9pZCI6NDQ1MTg0MjgsImlhdCI6MTYzOTA1ODA5MiwiaXNzIjoicHViLTM0NzkwNyIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.BWllDVCFl6lAF3oURloHuGLVDiCvRljOR9PsEp88l_I"><span>Share</span></a></p><p>If you want to see more frequent investing-related content, give me a follow on twitter @MT_Capital1.

The company&#8217;s services range from connecting travelers with owners in order to rent out shared spaces, private rooms or an entire property for themselves, supporting stays in duration anywhere from a few days to a few months, if desired. In addition, the company offers experiences, a series of in-person or online activities hosted by local experts that allow guests to participate in unique activities, of which act as an immersion of sorts into a local culture. The company, founded in 2007 and initially referred to as AirBed &amp; Breakfast, started off as a way for now-CEO Brian Cheskey and his co-founder to pay their rent. Offering air mattresses to individuals that were looking to attend nearby conferences in San Francisco but who could not afford or locate a reasonable hotel, the corporation has transformed the very manner in which many conduct their travel, now existing as a multi-billion dollar disruptive icon of sorts.&nbsp;</p><p>With this brief description of the company in mind, let&#8217;s take a look at the main opportunities and tailwinds the company aims to leverage both within the current operations and future growth initiatives.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>2.0 Opportunity and Tailwinds</strong></p><p>Before delving into a more broad discussion of current trends that are evidently in Airbnb's favor, it is worth breaking down what the company deems to be both their Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM) and Total Addressable Market (TAM).

Moving on to Long Term Stays, the company estimates that they will be able to address both the Global Apartment Market and approximately 10% of the Residential Rental Market, resulting in approximately $200B in value. Lastly, the company combines estimates of $1.1T for Non-Tourist Recreational Spend to arrive at a TAM of approximately $3.4T.&nbsp;Although these estimates for both SAM and TAM may appear ludicrous to some, it is important to gauge where the Travel and Hospitality Industry fits within the concept of a Global Economy. Before the emergence of the pandemic, a phenomenon that evidently reaped disastrous consequences on the industry as a whole, the sheer size of Travel and Tourism was astonishing, a feat that is likely to continue as our world moves towards a heightened sense of normalcy. More specifically, Travel and Tourism accounted for nearly 25% of all new jobs created around the world, 10% of all existing jobs and approximately 10.5% of Global Gross Domestic Product <a href="https://wttc.org/Research/Economic-Impact">[3]</a>. With these numbers in mind, it is an exciting prospect to consider the amount of success Airbnb may be able to reap from targeting an ever-expanding target market.&nbsp;</p><p>Moving on, it is worth discussing some notable tailwinds, no matter how abstract they may seem to be, that may have a tangible effect on Airbnb&#8217;s future success. The first is Airbnb&#8217;s transition into a verb. This phenomenon can be loosely described as an occurrence by where a brand transitions into a commonly used word; with notable examples ranging from companies/products such as Uber, PayPal, Bandaid, Tupperware, Jacuzzi, Google and many more. Airbnb is no different, now existing as a verb for many that refers to the simple act of renting a place to stay, cementing its brand as a unique moat in itself. In addition, the rise of Airbnb has evidently been a positive benefactor from the rise of the &#8220;Experience Economy&#8221;. In the late 90&#8217;s, James Gilmore and company coined this expression in a renowned study that analyzed how the transformation of a commodity, into a good or service, and finally into an experience, is often associated with heightened economic value at the latter end of the process, as outlined by the flow diagram below:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61b285d0-0568-4de5-b5a6-e4be90ccea2b_960x720.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61b285d0-0568-4de5-b5a6-e4be90ccea2b_960x720.png" width="588" height="441" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/61b285d0-0568-4de5-b5a6-e4be90ccea2b_960x720.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:720,&quot;width&quot;:960,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:588,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61b285d0-0568-4de5-b5a6-e4be90ccea2b_960x720.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61b285d0-0568-4de5-b5a6-e4be90ccea2b_960x720.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61b285d0-0568-4de5-b5a6-e4be90ccea2b_960x720.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61b285d0-0568-4de5-b5a6-e4be90ccea2b_960x720.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">The Progression of Economic Value <a href="https://consumerbehaviorexamples.wordpress.com/2018/03/07/experience-economy-2/">[4]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>As an example, a study performed by PCMA analyzed the fact that since 2016 (excluding pandemic-affected years) US consumers were spending more time and money at restaurants and bars in comparison to down at the commodity level, i.e. at grocery stores, corroborating our previously made assertions of the aforementioned value chain <a href="https://www.pcma.org/experience-economy-change-event-design/">[5]</a>. Moving over to the Travel and Hospitality Industry, I believe Airbnb offers customers, oftentimes, a more differentiated experience in comparison to hotels, a phenomenon that funny enough, often doesn&#8217;t come with a premium price tag in comparison to its counterpart. Taking a step back for a second, it is worth pondering why this is for a second. More specifically, when one thinks of a hotel, a differentiated experience does not usually come to mind. As an example, visions of grandiose may be pushed aside for recollections of a bed with plain white sheets, a bathroom that feels gross no matter how many times you think its been cleaned, and complimentary breakfasts that leave much to be desired, or maybe I just haven&#8217;t stayed at the right hotels. These memories aren&#8217;t by happenstance, with major hotel industry players carefully constructing experiences that no matter the geographic location are remarkably similar. As an example, Holiday Inn has become a hotel chain that most in the Western World are familiar with, particularly due to their impressive uniformity from location to location. The hotel chain first originated in the year 1952, inspired by Kemmon Wilson on a family trip to Washington DC. At the time, hotels were sparse to say the least, often offering non-memorable experiences, even charging Kemmon extra money for his five children <a href="https://traveltips.usatoday.com/history-holiday-inn-hotels-61884.html">[6]</a>. This trip left so much to be desired that Wilson came back an inspired man and decided to try to reinvent the way lodging operated by constructing approximately 400 different motels, each within a day&#8217;s drive of each other, across the country. These ideas can be thought of the gold standard that hotels operate according to today, with each holiday inn containing rooms measuring approximately 12 x 26 ft (including the bathroom), possessing telephones, televisions and ice machines, an on-premise restaurant and possessing child-friendly ideals.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe34cd41-761f-4190-af7f-112f3a8f3b28_306x444.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe34cd41-761f-4190-af7f-112f3a8f3b28_306x444.png" width="306" height="444" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/be34cd41-761f-4190-af7f-112f3a8f3b28_306x444.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:444,&quot;width&quot;:306,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe34cd41-761f-4190-af7f-112f3a8f3b28_306x444.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe34cd41-761f-4190-af7f-112f3a8f3b28_306x444.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe34cd41-761f-4190-af7f-112f3a8f3b28_306x444.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe34cd41-761f-4190-af7f-112f3a8f3b28_306x444.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">The First Holiday Inn</figcaption></figure></div><p>Flash forward a few decades later, this uniformity has spread far and wide may be one of the main reasons Airbnb has, and should continue to, reap large amounts of success. In other words, Airbnb may be the primary location where one goes for a unique experience. On the company&#8217;s website they declare that their mission is to <em>create a world where anyone can belong anywhere</em>, which though idealistic and cheesy is hard to disprove. Airbnb&#8217;s offer a gateway into a culture or location that hotels simply cannot, and as such the company has become an essential component of the what it means for many to have a good trip nowadays.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only does Airbnb appeal to the traveler, i.e. the guest side of the transaction, it is also offers a real value proposition to the host. The rise in popularity of Airbnb with those looking to rent out a room within or their entire house/apartment may have directly arisen due to the spread of the &#8220;Gig Economy&#8221;. This phenomenon can be loosely defined as a more flexible way of making end meets outside of the traditional 9-5. Whether that be with actively freelancing, engaging in side hustles such as driving an Uber, being a personal shopper with Instacart, or delivering meals with Doordash, this behavior has become very noticeable. In addition, with Upwork outlining the fact that approximately 36% of the total American workforce performs freelance work, it is evident that technology is fundamentally altering what is possible and the ways in which people can make money. Applied to Airbnb, it is no surprise that individuals have benefitted from the ability to earn income from renting out their properties, a feat that is likely to continue into the future. The very idea for Airbnb stemmed from the willingness to do just that. More specifically, Brian Chesky and his co-founding partner Joe Gebbia decided to charge a few individuals that were in town for a local conference to stay on air mattresses in their apartment, an effort made in order to help pay their rent why they envisioned new business ideas. Little did they know, the air mattresses in their apartment was the multi-billion dollar business idea in itself.

This can all be boiled down into a simple network effect: as more hosts list on the company&#8217;s platform, the more options that are available for the travelers themselves, thus increasing the attractiveness for guests; and as more guests join the platform, the more attractive it is for hosts to list their property seeing as their is a plethora of available customers. With this full-circle network effect in mind, it is no wonder Airbnb has been and will continue to be able to scale across the globe with ease. In comparison to traditional Travel and Hospitality Entities, it is vastly easier for the company to scale, since they can use word of mouth and the aforementioned network effects to penetrate a market that would otherwise require Millions in Real Estate investments for typical legacy hotel operators. Getting back to business, it is of undoubtable importance that we are able to understand both the functionality of both the <em><strong>Guest </strong></em>and <em><strong>Host </strong></em>sides of Airbnb&#8217;s technology.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Guests</strong></em></p><p>The guest-directed side of Airbnb&#8217;s platform can be split into two unique components, <em>Stays </em>and <em>Experiences.</em> <em>Stays</em> can be searched for directly on Airbnb&#8217;s website or mobile app and are easily navigable with the company&#8217;s clean UI. As an example, if one were looking to stay in Toronto from December 25th-28th with themselves and another they would be able to specify this criteria in the search bar and would be directed to a list of <em>Stays </em>accordingly:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb32ba14e-c720-4da3-8c97-94d6c75e4b9e_1600x648.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb32ba14e-c720-4da3-8c97-94d6c75e4b9e_1600x648.png" width="1456" height="590" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b32ba14e-c720-4da3-8c97-94d6c75e4b9e_1600x648.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:590,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb32ba14e-c720-4da3-8c97-94d6c75e4b9e_1600x648.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb32ba14e-c720-4da3-8c97-94d6c75e4b9e_1600x648.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb32ba14e-c720-4da3-8c97-94d6c75e4b9e_1600x648.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb32ba14e-c720-4da3-8c97-94d6c75e4b9e_1600x648.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Example <em>Stays</em> Query</figcaption></figure></div><p>Once one arrives at a place they are interested in they can then view the specifics of the location, read reviews from past guests and delve into the costs associated with the stay.

This guideline, of which Chesky mentions within a jampacked episode of Blitzscaling (highly recommend if you would like to get inside the brain of one of the founders) was originally set forth by Steve Jobs to Apple Engineers, by where he wanted the iPod interface to be designed in a way that music was at most three clicks away on the device, no matter where the user was located <a href="https://inkbotdesign.com/minimalist-web-design/">[8]</a>.</p><div id="youtube2-W608u6sBFpo" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;W608u6sBFpo&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W608u6sBFpo?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p> Applied to Airbnb, the founders wanted guests to be at most three clicks away from a booking a stay at any time.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8812117d-b003-465b-8f22-542f3a020a36_406x214.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8812117d-b003-465b-8f22-542f3a020a36_406x214.png" width="406" height="214" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8812117d-b003-465b-8f22-542f3a020a36_406x214.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:214,&quot;width&quot;:406,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8812117d-b003-465b-8f22-542f3a020a36_406x214.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8812117d-b003-465b-8f22-542f3a020a36_406x214.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8812117d-b003-465b-8f22-542f3a020a36_406x214.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8812117d-b003-465b-8f22-542f3a020a36_406x214.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">The 3 Click Rule</figcaption></figure></div><p>This effort was made with an evident focus on reducing the friction associated with using the platform and did not stop there. In 2008, when the company was founded, Fintech was not where it is today. Amidst a financial crisis there was not sufficient capital being directed at creating a multitude of scalable payment solutions. As such, PayPal dominated this space and was the go-to provider for most online commerce operators. Although Airbnb could&#8217;ve easily partnered with this behemoth at the time, they decided to take the road less travelled. More specifically, the founders feared that redirecting users from their website to a Paypal page in order to process the payment for a stay would greatly friction, a happening that they could not afford if they were to differentiate themselves from the booking experience of a hotel. As such, the founders (Nathan Blecharcyzk in particular) decided to build payment-processing capabilities in house, a feat that was extremely challenging on a technical level but one that resulted in a customer experience that increased in quality by orders of magnitude being that customers could now pay directly on the company&#8217;s website without being redirected. Friction-reducing functionality is further exacerbated when looking at features ranging from the company&#8217;s on-platform messaging services, i.e. the ability for hosts and guests to communicate directly on the application, as outlined below, being able to access important details about a stay on-app such as key code combinations, etc.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8a8dec5-1846-41b2-9d0f-b5c23aa384bc_1600x899.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8a8dec5-1846-41b2-9d0f-b5c23aa384bc_1600x899.png" width="1456" height="818" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d8a8dec5-1846-41b2-9d0f-b5c23aa384bc_1600x899.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:818,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8a8dec5-1846-41b2-9d0f-b5c23aa384bc_1600x899.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8a8dec5-1846-41b2-9d0f-b5c23aa384bc_1600x899.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8a8dec5-1846-41b2-9d0f-b5c23aa384bc_1600x899.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8a8dec5-1846-41b2-9d0f-b5c23aa384bc_1600x899.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Airbnb Chat Functionality <a href="https://www.airbnb.ca/resources/hosting-homes/a/new-professional-tools-simplify-hospitality-for-teams-258?locale=en&amp;_set_bev_on_new_domain=1638744903_YWI5MTc5MmM1YTlj">[9]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>In summary, Airbnb design choices were and still are made with an utmost focus on a clean experience. To the layman this may not seem important, but increasing the ease at which the customer is able to use the platform to its intended consequence is of irreplaceable value and offers a tangible benefit in comparison to competitors.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, the ability for Airbnb&#8217;s platform to scale so effectively is directly rooted in their trust-based review system. When comparing Airbnb with typical Travel and Hospitality Entities, the company differs in the fact that instead of having a one-sided business model that is vertically integrated and is very asset heavy, they have a community-based model that splits the economics being generated between the various stakeholders that are connected throughout the platform. In order for this business model to be functional it relies on trust. Airbnb supports both sides of their marketplace, thus a review system is applied to both hosts and guest. Existing as a five-star system, guests can see the average rating of a host and read reviews of individuals that have previously stayed with the host.&nbsp;</p><div

exactly the company makes money from it.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>4.0 How Airbnb makes $$$</strong></p><p>In the previous section we discussed the nature of Airbnb&#8217;s two-sided marketplace, particularly how it is predominantly populated by individuals on the guest side of things rather than its host counterpart. In conjunction with leveraging network effects to combat this dilemma, Airbnb also structures their business model in a very host-friendly manner. More specifically, on each stay that is generated through the company&#8217;s platform Airbnb only takes 3% of the Total Transaction Value, which in essence covers the cost of processing the payment itself. Airbnb makes the majority of their money on the guest-side of the transaction, charging guests a service fee that is anywhere between 5-15% of the Total Transaction Value. Being that their is no shortage of potential guests on the company&#8217;s platform, this strategy makes a whole lot of sense. In order to cement these points home, a useful visual outlining a hypothetical transaction and where the guest and host fits in accordingly can be seen outlined below:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8b1268f-a226-498c-ad06-a25a86df6153_1600x1207.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8b1268f-a226-498c-ad06-a25a86df6153_1600x1207.png" width="1456" height="1098" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d8b1268f-a226-498c-ad06-a25a86df6153_1600x1207.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1098,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8b1268f-a226-498c-ad06-a25a86df6153_1600x1207.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8b1268f-a226-498c-ad06-a25a86df6153_1600x1207.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8b1268f-a226-498c-ad06-a25a86df6153_1600x1207.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8b1268f-a226-498c-ad06-a25a86df6153_1600x1207.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Airbnb Transaction Graphic <a href="https://fourweekmba.com/airbnb-business-model/">[10]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Now that we have a better understanding of how Airbnb makes money, let&#8217;s take a look at their most recent earnings report and perform an analysis on the contents within accordingly.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>5.0 Financial Analysis</strong></p><p>This section will be spent analyzing the key components of Airbnb&#8217;s most recent Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement and drawing conclusions based upon the values contained therein.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Income Statement</strong></em></p><p><em>Revenue&nbsp;</em></p><p>Airbnb&#8217;s Revenue came in at approximately $2.24B for the quarter, representing a 67% increase YoY, however since these are favorable comps due to the affect of the pandemic, we will also examine the percentage increase relative to Q3&#8217;19, which was 36%.

In addition, with consumer preferences changing as a result of the heightened degree of technologically-enabled work freedom that emerged as a result of the pandemic, the company is starting to see increased amounts of non-urban whole home and larger home rentals, which has helped to increase the rates as well. In summary, the activity in Airbnb&#8217;s platform is starting to show signs of a full recovery, albeit not out of the clear yet with the emergence of the omnicron variant. Being that as it may, heightened ADRs, which management anticipates are likely to remain as such in the coming quarters is likely to assist top-line growth in the short term.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>7.0 Valuation and Competition&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In order to get a better sense of where Airbnb fits in amongst their competition, we will be comparing a series of metrics for the company and its peers.

More specifically, in the 2017-2019 period Booking was evidently able to yield more efficient marketing results on a GP basis in comparison to Airbnb. This is evidently due to how the company&#8217;s operate their businesses, i.e. how Airbnb keeps most costs on the guest side of the transaction in order to make the experience for individual hosts as pleasant as possible. It is positive to see Airbnb making more efficient use of marketing relative to GP in the first 9 months of this year however it remains to be seen how they will be able extract more GP per dollar of GBV without seriously decreasing host satisfaction (i.e. they would have to increase their take on this side of transaction which may not result in the smoothest host experience).&nbsp; It is also worth noting that Booking stated that their brand marketing has gone up significantly as a result of pandemic induced headwinds and the fact that they have stopped reporting the exact value makes one wonder whether or not they are still within reasonable distance of their pre-pandemic efficiencies. This would be a comparison I&#8217;d be very curious to see given how much quicker Airbnb recovered post-covid relative to their GBV and the diligent cost controls they&#8217;ve implemented since then as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Before moving on to final discussions, it is worth looking at the progression of Airbnb in their early years of operation in comparison to Booking.

Displaying projected top-line growth that is in-line with its peers, improving marketing efficiencies that are likely to be approaching the effectiveness of Booking&#8217;s, improving EBITDA prospects and remarkably similar GBV behavior to its Booking counterpart, there is a lot to ponder here. An investment in Airbnb is likely to come alongside a belief that the company will be able to maintain their popularity to drive sustainable GBV growth over the next decade while also maintaining profitability through strict expense controls. I lean on the side of optimism and do believe Airbnb will be able to achieve this, however, I do understand that an investment here comes with a price tag. As we have seen throughout history, the world&#8217;s best brands are usually valued at a premium, however, this comes with much higher scrutiny and with the market behavior of late, Airbnb will need to execute to perfection if they wish to keep trading at this kind of valuation, in my opinion. </p><div><hr></div><p><strong>8.0 Closing Thoughts</strong></p><p>Now that we&#8217;ve satisfied the GARP crowd with the acknowledgement of Airbnb&#8217;s valuation and potential shortcomings with regards to size in comparison to their peers, (don&#8217;t throw your napkin math at me after this), let&#8217;s delve deeper into what I believe is one of Airbnb&#8217;s greatest strengths, their anti-fragility.&nbsp; This term, coined by Nassim Taleb, refers to a property of systems to gain or thrive from the presence of external stressors, noise, chaos etc. In other words, applied to companies, I'd like to define the phenomenon as an enterprise that is able to survive and potentially excel from events that could be classified as problematic, or even worse, catastrophic. In 2020 we were shocked with an event that not many saw coming, a pandemic that fundamentally altered the way humanity functioned, an occurrence that saw borders close and the travel and hospitality industry completely decimated in the span of a few weeks. Airbnb in particular suffered, experiencing more cancellations than total bookings shortly after the emergence of the virus and later laying off 25%+ of their workforce in response to the stresses the business saw.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5b51d52-bcc1-4afa-9b14-1d4b8d80c934_1115x140.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5b51d52-bcc1-4afa-9b14-1d4b8d80c934_1115x140.png" width="1115" height="140" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d5b51d52-bcc1-4afa-9b14-1d4b8d80c934_1115x140.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:140,&quot;width&quot;:1115,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5b51d52-bcc1-4afa-9b14-1d4b8d80c934_1115x140.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5b51d52-bcc1-4afa-9b14-1d4b8d80c934_1115x140.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5b51d52-bcc1-4afa-9b14-1d4b8d80c934_1115x140.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5b51d52-bcc1-4afa-9b14-1d4b8d80c934_1115x140.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Example Airbnb COVID Headlien</figcaption></figure></div><p>&nbsp;Although this behavior doesn&#8217;t exemplify the company thriving under pressure, looking back now at how well the company has gotten back on track, how fast they&#8217;ve rebounded their GBV relative to their peers and their evident nimbleness, I was and am still very impressed on how the company has executed and continues to adapt. As an example and as mentioned earlier, technology is fundamentally altering the way the world is functioning, and the working habits of many professionals are adapting to the digital age. Aligning themselves perfectly with this trend, the company has seen notable growth in their long-term stays, with over 45% of total nights booked on the platform in Q3&#8217;21 being at least 7 days in length. Not only does this represent a great opportunity to expand both their SAM/TAM (i.e. the move towards longer form travel) but it also highlights management&#8217;s ability to cater towards the dynamic needs of guests in general. The pandemic gave investors great insight into how Airbnb can function in arguably the worst situation a hospitality business could operate with, and they seemed to have passed with flying colors.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking forward, many would like to tout the risks associated with regulations as one of the main headwinds for Airbnb. Though true, Airbnb&#8217;s organization operates almost as an aggregator of splinter cells, relying on individuals situated across the globe to function. The company attributes no more than a percent (plus or minus a few basis points) of Revenue to more than one city. Therefore, regardless of what the regulatory situation may be in that locale, the outcome is not likely to have substantial impacts on either the company&#8217;s top or bottom lines regardless. Cities have also seemed to switch their tune up regarding Airbnb (spare New York City&#8217;s hard fought battle regarding the nature of short-term rentals that doesn&#8217;t seem to ever want to end). More specifically with the local economic activity of cities faltering during the pandemic as a result of decreased tourism and travel activity, many started to rethink their opinions regarding the presence of Airbnb, especially seeing as how it can bring individuals into regions that would normally not see increased activity from hotels. I am by no means an expert on policy, however, in my opinion, Airbnb operates as a net positive, and I don&#8217;t see opinions surrounding that assertion turning for the worst anytime soon. Lastly, the company has stated that their Active Listings have grown each quarter this year (I wish they would disclose the growth rate), after 2019-2020 Listing numbers remained relatively flat. The number of listings will continue to be one of the biggest risks going forwards, specifically since the phenomenon of demand with their platform is much easier to come across than supply, respectively. As such, transaction economics (i.e. how Airbnb makes most of their money through platform fees charged to guests) will continue to be a direct line between host satisfaction and resultant listing supply. With the majority of the hosts being individuals (close to 90%) this structure is likely to keep them content and with the ability for a side hustle, gig economy role or form of economic empowerment, whatever you would like to call it, available for the taking with hosting on Airbnb, supply should not be an issue, however, this will need to be monitored. </p><p>My closing thoughts are as follows. I do believe Airbnb can sustain meaningful growth going forwards and the company is evidently moving in the right direction with how their business is operating under the hood. Airbnb&#8217;s brand and their existence as the go-to-location for all things unique in the travel realm should continue to exist uninterrupted, especially when judging how Chesky and company are still intertwined with the direction the corporation is headed. Being founder-led is a cliche that we have all come across, however I believe Airbnb&#8217;s management is top notch and is likely to continue executing to the tee. That being said Airbnb is not a company you can set and forget, in my opinion. With approximately half of the GBV of its competitors and a much higher multiple, investors will need to continually monitor execution to ensure valuation compression doesn&#8217;t occur after faltering results. </p><div><hr></div><p><strong>9.0 Conclusion</strong></p><p>In conclusion, there is no doubt that Airbnb has fundamentally altered the very manner in which travel is conducted. Becoming intertwined with pop culture and existing as a verb that transcends generations are all essential ingredients to cult brands, and Airbnb possesses them. Not without risks, I have outlined some key comparative points and discussion items that I believe offer a great starting point for considering Airbnb as an investment, or not.

<em><strong>Increased Need for Organizational Agility</strong></em>. More specifically, a study performed by MIT identified that firms that prioritized agility were able to grow revenues at a 37% higher rate and generate 30% higher profit in comparison to non-agile counterparts <a href="https://www.oliverwyman.com/our-expertise/insights/2018/apr/organizational-agility.html">[4]</a>. In addition, a recent OliverWyman survey determined that despite nearly 90% of CIOs indicating that agility was important, only 26% of these individuals identified their processes as agile themselves. Software is essential to businesses trying to exceed in the modern era, and as such increased adoption of various digital tools is likely to only increase in organizations looking to gain an edge in an everchanging world. Connecting numbers to these assertions, a study performed by SnowSoftware indicates that approximately 73% of the IT Leaders contained within large corporations studied reported that they are now running anywhere from 100 to 1000 SaaS applications across their network, a steady increase over the last 12 months In addition, outside of staffing, IT managers expect to continue to direct a substantial amount of any additional budgets at the SaaS offerings their organizations require to remain functional, highlighting that an <em><strong>Increased Reliance on Software</strong></em> is here to stay:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87fc20be-58e0-4e2e-a6a3-fffe306c92c3_920x638.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87fc20be-58e0-4e2e-a6a3-fffe306c92c3_920x638.png" width="920" height="638" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/87fc20be-58e0-4e2e-a6a3-fffe306c92c3_920x638.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:638,&quot;width&quot;:920,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87fc20be-58e0-4e2e-a6a3-fffe306c92c3_920x638.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87fc20be-58e0-4e2e-a6a3-fffe306c92c3_920x638.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87fc20be-58e0-4e2e-a6a3-fffe306c92c3_920x638.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87fc20be-58e0-4e2e-a6a3-fffe306c92c3_920x638.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Thus, in summary, there is an evident opportunity for Monday to benefit from the increasing digitization of the workforce, the recognition of the importance of agility, as well as the undeniable velocity of software adoption. With these factors in mind, Monday estimates that their 2020 TAM was approximately $56.1B, a value that they anticipate to grow at a CAGR of 12% and reach approximately $87.6B. This estimate spans across Monday&#8217;s use-case markets, of which can be seen summarized below:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Project Management ($4B)</p></li><li><p>Collaborative Applications ($21.7B)</p></li><li><p>Sales Force Productivity Management ($11.5B)</p></li><li><p>Software Change and Process Management ($4.6B)</p></li><li><p>Marketing Campaign Management ($14.3B)</p></li></ul><p>The beauty of Monday&#8217;s software is their ability to serve many verticals. It is therefore not out of the realm of possibilities that the company can expand their reach into new avenues proportionally to time, especially since their software can spur value creation in organizations present within any industry. </p><p>Moving on, it is worth discussing the limitations to current software-based approaches, of which Monday aims to solve with their offerings. Starting off with Software Architecture, these constraints are in essence specifications that enable developers to formalize a set of rules that a piece of software should respect and be designed or manipulated in accordance to. Though important from a design perspective, a lot of project/task management software has been created in order to standardize a repetitive set of workflows, a phenomenon that restricts its ease-of-use as a result, forcing employees to adapt their work flows to match how said software solves problems. Also of note is a complexity tradeoff of sorts that individuals are often faced with, i.e. whether to utilize complex software to cater towards difficult tasks or to leverage a software with a high ease-of-use and fill in the gaps between functionality and desired output with additional tools. We have seen companies such as Palantir have enormous success in the software realm, offering developers tools that are able to connect unthinkable amounts of data and extract value from said data through an easy-to-use platform. Monday aims to have similar success, creating a point of truth that can be used to manage a variety enterprise complexities.&nbsp;</p><p>Almost everyone that has operated within a large corporation understands how disjointed processes can be. Not only is there a separation between the structure and workflows of different departments, there also exists a disparity between the software solutions utilized therein as well. More specifically, software caters towards specific functions ranging from sales to engineering and research and development, and as such leads to the creation of siloes, a phenomenon that essentially represents the inability for cross-department work to occur, seeing as things like data, business intelligence processes etc. are not accessible by all:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8095b1ec-48e6-446e-8035-7b4a7dc7d17a_806x304.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8095b1ec-48e6-446e-8035-7b4a7dc7d17a_806x304.png" width="600" height="226.302729528536" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8095b1ec-48e6-446e-8035-7b4a7dc7d17a_806x304.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:304,&quot;width&quot;:806,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:600,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8095b1ec-48e6-446e-8035-7b4a7dc7d17a_806x304.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8095b1ec-48e6-446e-8035-7b4a7dc7d17a_806x304.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8095b1ec-48e6-446e-8035-7b4a7dc7d17a_806x304.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8095b1ec-48e6-446e-8035-7b4a7dc7d17a_806x304.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Interorganizational Siloes <a href="https://www.adaptive-organizations.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/From-Silos-to-value-chain-1280x640.png">[5]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>As the digitization of processes continued, the stack of technology and the complexity contained therein is only getting growing larger, a phenomenon that is harming workplace communication in the process. New communication tools such as Slack, Zoom, or Facebook Workplace are common avenues where employees can interact, plan out projects etc., however, these platforms are often not where the employees get work done, creating a disparity between execution and collaboration. To represent this numerically, a study performed by Quantified Communications estimates that businesses with more than 100 employees spend more than 17 hours a week clarifying unclear messages, objectives and actions, representing a frequently occurring and costly set of mistakes <a href="https://firstup.io/blog/workplace-communication-its-now-more-important-than-ever/">[6]</a>.&nbsp; As such, software that allows for both communication with team members and the completion of projects/processes therein is essential to the functionality of a healthy team.</p><p>Lastly, modern software solutions fail to cater towards the automation and integration requirements of the modern enterprise. Starting off with the former, software tools often lack the functionality needed to automate repetitive tasks that many face on a daily basis. Monday&#8217;s software aims to automate the boring stuff, allowing workers to focus on higher-level tasks that create more value for their company as a result. Moving on to the latter, modern software often requires code to connect the various point solutions or custom built applications that exist within a company. The technical aptitude required to interconnect these moving pieces creates additional siloes, forcing users to leverage software regardless of whether or not it is an optimal solution. Monday&#8217;s software aims to put no-code/low-code functionality in the hands of all, a prospect that should improve transparency, integration and openness across a company.&nbsp;</p><p>With all of these factors in mind, we are now ready to break down Monday&#8217;s technology and get to the bottom of how they aim to be THE software of an enterprise.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>3.0 Technology&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In order to understand the value proposition of Monday&#8217;s SaaS offering, we must be able to comprehend the different facets of what the company denotes as their Work OS. The Work OS, described simply, relies on an inherent modularity, of which leverages no-code and low-code functionality for individuals to build solutions. With these solutions in place, employees can then create solutions ranging from applications to project management tools, all on top of the aforementioned building blocks, but more on that later. The key components of the Work OS can be seen described in detail below.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Boards:</strong></em> This aspect of the Work OS can be thought of the foundations of the Monday Platform, seeing as they are often where a lot of the product functionality is built on top of. More specifically, a board can be thought of as a schema-less database that allows users to organize tasks, campaigns, schedules and more, as outlined by the following:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a89ac66-00e0-42c1-b693-a75bed4e29b0_1600x917.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a89ac66-00e0-42c1-b693-a75bed4e29b0_1600x917.png" width="1456" height="834" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1a89ac66-00e0-42c1-b693-a75bed4e29b0_1600x917.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:834,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a89ac66-00e0-42c1-b693-a75bed4e29b0_1600x917.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a89ac66-00e0-42c1-b693-a75bed4e29b0_1600x917.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a89ac66-00e0-42c1-b693-a75bed4e29b0_1600x917.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a89ac66-00e0-42c1-b693-a75bed4e29b0_1600x917.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Monday Board Example</figcaption></figure></div><p>A board will consist of two main components, <em>Columns </em>and <em>Items.</em> The former is relatively self-explanatory, representing data points ranging from work assignments, status and priority levels, file attachments and more.

Users have the ability to access Monday&#8217;s Automation Center, of which consists of a series of prebuilt automations that can be applied to boards:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5d39aa3-ecc2-4723-8d31-0d262e3a12c0_1600x880.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5d39aa3-ecc2-4723-8d31-0d262e3a12c0_1600x880.png" width="1456" height="801" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b5d39aa3-ecc2-4723-8d31-0d262e3a12c0_1600x880.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:801,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5d39aa3-ecc2-4723-8d31-0d262e3a12c0_1600x880.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5d39aa3-ecc2-4723-8d31-0d262e3a12c0_1600x880.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5d39aa3-ecc2-4723-8d31-0d262e3a12c0_1600x880.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5d39aa3-ecc2-4723-8d31-0d262e3a12c0_1600x880.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Monday Automation Center <a href="https://support.monday.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001222900-monday-com-Automations">[9]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>The aforementioned goes hand in hand with what Monday denotes as <em>Integrations</em>. More specifically, integrations allow for boards created with the company&#8217;s software to connect directly to external tools, spurring exchanges of data and insights and reducing the prevalence of siloes within an organization as a result. Monday supports integrations with approximately 40 different tools ranging from Microsoft Teams to Excel and Slack. Integrations can also be tied directly into automations. Example use-cases include notifying a user and creating a new item within a board if a Stripe Payment is received, automatically scheduling zoom calls if an action-item is completed and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, Monday is evidently focused on reducing the frictions associated with using their boards through the provision of <em>Ready-Made Templates</em>.

In other words, this metric highlights the company&#8217;s ability to generate more revenue from customers they already have. The change in this value over the last the last few quarters can be seen outlined below:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0537104-fbbd-4d33-b414-7c9673cd1efa_752x452.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0537104-fbbd-4d33-b414-7c9673cd1efa_752x452.png" width="520" height="312.5531914893617" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e0537104-fbbd-4d33-b414-7c9673cd1efa_752x452.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:452,&quot;width&quot;:752,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:520,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0537104-fbbd-4d33-b414-7c9673cd1efa_752x452.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0537104-fbbd-4d33-b414-7c9673cd1efa_752x452.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0537104-fbbd-4d33-b414-7c9673cd1efa_752x452.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0537104-fbbd-4d33-b414-7c9673cd1efa_752x452.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Change in NDRR (&gt; 10 Users)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Focusing on NDRR for clients with more than 10 users is important seeing as the company directs the bulk of their S&amp;M at the acquisition of these clients.

The company was adamant in their most recent conference call that they intend to continue to hire more enterprise-class sales people, an endeavor that they hope will continue to fuel the growth trajectory they have been able to maintain as of right now.

Looking at the success of Excel, this software benefited enormously from the growth of Windows in general, becoming dominant in the late 90s as the OS gained popularity.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c124157-1f2d-4d56-a8d1-222c8a36c3d4_950x239.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c124157-1f2d-4d56-a8d1-222c8a36c3d4_950x239.png" width="950" height="239" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1c124157-1f2d-4d56-a8d1-222c8a36c3d4_950x239.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:239,&quot;width&quot;:950,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c124157-1f2d-4d56-a8d1-222c8a36c3d4_950x239.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c124157-1f2d-4d56-a8d1-222c8a36c3d4_950x239.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c124157-1f2d-4d56-a8d1-222c8a36c3d4_950x239.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c124157-1f2d-4d56-a8d1-222c8a36c3d4_950x239.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>After nearly 40 years, Excel is still a clear leader, an occurrence that isn&#8217;t rooted in the software&#8217;s best-in class features or bells and whistles, but rather, indicative of how Microsoft has taken the world by storm, cementing the Office Suite as the logical first step for almost all processes conducted within the modern workspace. Getting more applicable to our analysis, it makes sense that Teams was the most popular surveyed application given its proximity to other Suite Apps. As of June 2021, there are over 1B users of Microsoft Office Suite, a statistic that I believe points towards Teams continued success in the team management space. To play devil&#8217;s advocate, many will mention the recent release of Workdocs and how this could act further improve the stickiness of Monday&#8217;s platform, giving users more of a reason to conduct almost all of their processes directly within the platform. Though ambitious, I am hesitant to believe this will result in a tangible increase in Monday&#8217;s market share. As an example, Google Suite has over 6 million paying businesses that are reliant on its services/applications, a value that will unlikely experience meaningful churn as a result of customers preferring Monday&#8217;s work docs. Speaking more anecdotally now, in my own short professional experience, I have utilized multiple different software to manage my own and my team&#8217;s workflows, and switching from one to the other (i.e. from Smartsheets to Microsoft teams/planners) was relatively painless and did not leave a void in my day-to-day. This can obviously vary from one person but a little personal flavor doesn&#8217;t hurt here.&nbsp;  In short, I cannot get myself to pay such a high multiple for a SaaS company I feel is largely undifferentiated within their space, no matter how fast they are growing.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>9.0 Conclusion </strong></p><p>In summary, Monday offers itself up as an interesting opportunity. With easy-to-use and functional technology, real-world use-cases that have helped major enterprises improve efficiencies and fast-paced growth, there is a lot to like. On the other hand, the company&#8217;s valuation and their place within a software niche I believe will be difficult to shakeup in a major way will make me stay way from Monday as a portfolio allocation. Regardless, this research offers a starting point for considering Monday as an investment and I hope that it was of use to you.

The company&#8217;s cloud-based, open application programming interface (API) platform allows for card issuing and transaction processing services to be incorporated directly within or on the outskirts of the processes of developers, product managers and entrepreneurs.&nbsp; The company&#8217;s value proposition is simple and easy to digest. More specifically, the company&#8217;s tech helps facilitate a variety of different use-cases within some of the most well-known corporations worldwide. These include the ability for modern card issuing to cater towards Doordash&#8217;s operations, i.e. enabling the transfer of money from the account of the app users to the driver purchasing the food; moving money from an Affirm or Klarna BNPL card directly to the merchant; or modern card issuing for Square&#8217;s Cash App, allowing for peer-to-peer transfers to be directly reflected on user debit cards.</p><p>Now that we have a general understanding of what MQ does and what they offer their clients, let&#8217;s take a look at some key opportunities that the company hopes to use to their advantage within their processes.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>2.0 Opportunity</strong></p><p>According to a 2020 Nilson Report, of which detailed the sheer enormity of network transactions that occur worldwide, approximately 468 billion transactions for goods and services attributable to Global Network Cards occurred that year <a href="https://nilsonreport.com/mention/1428/1link/#:~:text=Visa%2C%20UnionPay%2C%20Mastercard%2C%20American,%2C%20up%206.0%25%20over%202019">[2]</a>. These network transactions are heavily reliant on a complex ecosystem, a statement that doesn&#8217;t sufficiently relay the sheer vastness of parties involved with each transaction. More specifically, a typical transaction has ties to Banks, both of the Issuing and Acquiring variety, Acquirer and Issuer Processors and card networks such as the prominent fintech rails, Mastercard and Visa. A helpful illustrative diagram of the anatomy of a transaction can be seen outlined below:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0706ae26-9d29-48a9-99a6-f0187449bd6a_1600x757.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0706ae26-9d29-48a9-99a6-f0187449bd6a_1600x757.png" width="1456" height="689" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0706ae26-9d29-48a9-99a6-f0187449bd6a_1600x757.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:689,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0706ae26-9d29-48a9-99a6-f0187449bd6a_1600x757.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0706ae26-9d29-48a9-99a6-f0187449bd6a_1600x757.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0706ae26-9d29-48a9-99a6-f0187449bd6a_1600x757.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0706ae26-9d29-48a9-99a6-f0187449bd6a_1600x757.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Anatomy of a Transaction <a href="https://merchantcostconsulting.com/lower-credit-card-processing-fees/acquiring-banks-vs-issuing-banks-in-credit-card-processing/">[3]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>With the functionality of a transaction in mind, it is time we delve deeper into the disparity between the Acquirer and the Issuer sides of the transactions. Over the last decade, there has been noticeable innovation on the Acquirer side of the transaction, however, the same cannot be said about its counterpart. This phenomenon is corroborated when looking at the difference between the presence of acquiring banks and issuer processors, with 300+ acquiring banks existing in the United States but only 200 Issuer Processors present Globally. Issuer Processors, which are essentially entities that connect with networks and an issuing bank to provide a system of record, manage the issuance of cards, communicate with settlement entities and authorize transactions, have seen relatively lackluster amounts of innovation, traditionally existing as legacy operators. MQ aims to change this, simplifying and creating a democratized issuing process that extends its reach beyond the scope of physical card issuance into a realm that facilitates digital commerce, mobile wallets and cross-border transactions. We will delve into the technical specifics of these products in later sections, however, for now, we should focus on some key trends that the company aims to leverage within their operations.

More specifically, there has been an evident <em><strong>Convergence of Software and Payments </strong></em>of late, a prospect that is likely to continue. Put simply, our payment methods have now been intertwined in a seamless manner with many of the applications we use on a regular basis, whether it be with through ride sharing or digital marketplaces, as examples. Historically payments were split between those that were card-based or non-card based (i.e. alternative payments). Card Payments traditionally occurred at a point of sale with a customer paying for goods/services, whereas non-card payments were often used to facilitate bank transfers or cross-border interactions, as examples. In a world that is becoming ever-digitized and ever-complex, software companies are starting to partner with payment companies in order to ensure they are able to cater toward their end-users preferences, i.e. with card or alternative payments. A recent study performed by SafetyPay estimates that over three billion people worldwide do not have access to credit cards and two billion do not have access to bank accounts as well as the fact that 39% of e-commerce transactions occurring in 2020 happening via alternative digital payments <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/businessreporter/2021/01/19/whats-next-for-global-digital-payments-in-2021-video/?sh=24e534733547">[6]</a>.

Secondly, the Gig Economy is changing the manner in which work is being done. I have harped on this at lengths within my Upwork and Fiverr deep-dives, however, with a growing number of individuals engaging in gig work ranging from driving ubers to becoming personal shoppers, traditional bi-weekly payment methods are no longer suitable for these situations. Lastly, whether you like it or not, data is becoming the most valuable commodity in the world and is fundamentally altering archaic industries, enhancing the manner in which business analytics are conducted. Take Upstart for example, a company that leverages millions of data points to do away with the FICO score and underwrite a higher number of loans all while mitigating credit risk, data is useful to say the least. With all of these ramblings in mind, companies require a scalable and reliable platform that is able to meet the growing payment requirements of the modern business.&nbsp;</p><p>To put a stamp on things, Nilson estimates that approximately $6.7T in transaction volume went through US issuers in 2020.

Customers are able to create their card product, set up funding sources, cardholders and cards and then start simulating mock transactions within a sandbox of sorts to truly understand the functionality. Developers can then <em>Configure Cards with open APIs</em>, meaning that they can define the specific attributes of the cards they wish to issue. More specifically, it can be decided whether the cards will be compatible with ATM, point of sale or online use-cases as well as their various verification requirements, whether that be through physical presence, address or postal codes. Options are also given for single-use cards that terminate after the single transaction they are intended for or multi-use cards that expire at a pre-specified date. Clients also have a series of choices with regards to the customization of their cards. These include but are not limited to choosing a custom logo design, carrier, signature and graphics that help convey the desired messaging of the company&#8217;s brand. The components of physical cards can be chosen as well, i.e. whether or not they have a magnetic stripe, are NFC-compatible or Visa/MC chip-enabled. MQ cards are also easily integrated with digital wallets by way of tokenization. Tokenization is essentially where the company de-identifies sensitive cardholder data by converting it into strings of randomly generated numbers known as tokens. This process allows for mobile apps to be integrated with MQ endpoints in order to request, store and provide the ability to store MQ-issued cards in digital wallets ranging from Apple to Google Pay, an exciting prospect when one considers the sheer volume of users of this tech. The MQ platform also allows for the <em>Management of Card Programs</em>, functionality where devs can manage activation, physical card ordering and fulfillment, card suspension and lost/stolen card reporting and much more. All of these features are accessible through the MQ card management dashboard, of which is outlined below:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9f89fbd-d77d-4ab0-8d8a-3f9ac97b4f0d_800x500.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9f89fbd-d77d-4ab0-8d8a-3f9ac97b4f0d_800x500.png" width="800" height="500" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e9f89fbd-d77d-4ab0-8d8a-3f9ac97b4f0d_800x500.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:500,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9f89fbd-d77d-4ab0-8d8a-3f9ac97b4f0d_800x500.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9f89fbd-d77d-4ab0-8d8a-3f9ac97b4f0d_800x500.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9f89fbd-d77d-4ab0-8d8a-3f9ac97b4f0d_800x500.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9f89fbd-d77d-4ab0-8d8a-3f9ac97b4f0d_800x500.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">MQ Dashboard <a href="https://www.marqeta.com/docs/developer-guides/cards-dashboard">[10]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Also of note is how MQ cards can be <em>embedded within customer applications</em>. Normally if a company desired to add this functionality to one of their products they would have had to go through the process of ensuring their tech was compliant to Payment Card Industry Data standards (PCI DSS), a set of guidelines that are in place to ensure that any companies handling payment information maintain a secure environment. With MQ, the company has created widgets that allow cardholders to activate cards and set PINs within web and mobile apps all while embedded sensitive data is kept PCI compliant, a unique value proposition to say the least. Lastly, MQ gives full capabilities to set up primary constituents of card functionality such as Primary Account Numbers, Personal Identification Numbers, CVC codes and more, allowing developers to validate their programs easily before launch. Once ready, cards can be <em>Instantly Issued</em>, attributable to the fact that MQ has a series of bank partnerships and direct integrations with Visa and Mastercard card networks. &nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>MQ Processing and Settlement</strong></em></p><p>A general overview of the MQ&#8217;s processing related features, of which are applicable to payments made with the physical, virtual or tokenized cards they have issued can be seen outlined below:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd7f1fb8-1dfb-4952-b5bd-3e08c0ccedc7_1066x598.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd7f1fb8-1dfb-4952-b5bd-3e08c0ccedc7_1066x598.png" width="1066" height="598" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/dd7f1fb8-1dfb-4952-b5bd-3e08c0ccedc7_1066x598.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:598,&quot;width&quot;:1066,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd7f1fb8-1dfb-4952-b5bd-3e08c0ccedc7_1066x598.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd7f1fb8-1dfb-4952-b5bd-3e08c0ccedc7_1066x598.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd7f1fb8-1dfb-4952-b5bd-3e08c0ccedc7_1066x598.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd7f1fb8-1dfb-4952-b5bd-3e08c0ccedc7_1066x598.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">MQ Processing </figcaption></figure></div><p>Processing transactions in a secure manner is made possible with MQ&#8217;s arsenal of technological capabilities. <em>Secure Authentication</em> for physical cards occurs through either a PIN or signature verification whereas digital card counterparts users are authenticated using either address verification, card verification values or 3D secure methods.

Standard funding models requires the company to preload funds into an individual&#8217;s account and maintain sufficient balances for each cardholder&#8217;s transaction, a tedious process that requires one to be on top of ensuring no accounts or under or over funded. MQ simplifies this process through the provision of <em>JIT (Just-in-Time) Funding,</em> a process that funds an account in real time. Developers can configure an endpoint within their application that receives and responds to JIT funding requests and upon approval (i.e. based upon the aforementioned criteria) MQ will move funds from the client&#8217;s funding source into their customer&#8217;s account. MQ also supports complex transactions. More specifically, if users would like to engage in a dual-message transaction such as giving a server a tip after a meal has been paid for, MQ handles the receipt of clearing files from the associated payment network, processes the transaction and communicates that the transaction has been completed back to the payment network, i.e. <em>Accurate Transaction Clearing.&nbsp;</em></p><p>MQ supports an additional layer of functionality with processing payments through the intertwinement of said processing with <em>Real-Time Notifications. </em>MQ webhooks can be used to relay information to end-users depending on various processing events. Example use-cases include providing customers with a notification once their food delivery has been paid for saying that their order will arrive shortly or setting up notifications on product returns to ensure the client is able to apply credit back to an account in an expedient manner, to name a few. Lastly, MQ ensures their processes are data-analysis/cleaning friendly through the provision of <em>Reconciliation Acceleration</em>. Through a subset of JIT processes, i.e. if a customer is using Gateway JIT for card funding, developers can insert metadata into transactions, such as a booking ids to assist with the creation of transaction records.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<em><strong>MQ Applications&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p>Outside of the general functionality behind issuing cards and processing the payments made with these cards, customers can utilize a series of applications, all contained within the dashboard, to gain a series of insights surrounding all facets of the payment lifecycle.

MQ ensures risk management is a priority and allows customers to tweak the rules of a decisioning engine, of which approves or declines transactions in real-time, providing a layer of <em>Fraud Protection</em>. In the event where transactions that go through need to be disputed or reviewed, MQ provides <em>Case Management</em> through a series of API endpoints that help clients submit and track chargebacks and then send push notifications to the overseer when updates have been received from the card network. Lastly, customers can leverage a series of <em>Compliance and Reporting </em>and <em>Data Intelligence </em>capabilities through the MQ dashboard of which allow individuals to monitor and review reports that are adherent to anti-money laundering and BSA regulations as well use data to gain insights regarding factors ranging from chargebacks to card activities using the transaction data associated with a card program.&nbsp;</p><p>With all of this functionality in mind, we now understand the technological capabilities of MQ&#8217;s platform.

In order to cement what we have discussed in this section, let&#8217;s take a look at how MQ was able to assist DoorDash with their unique payment needs, as an example.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffae11670-fe5c-4452-9bfa-f2587daa50b3_774x295.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffae11670-fe5c-4452-9bfa-f2587daa50b3_774x295.png" width="774" height="295" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fae11670-fe5c-4452-9bfa-f2587daa50b3_774x295.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:295,&quot;width&quot;:774,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffae11670-fe5c-4452-9bfa-f2587daa50b3_774x295.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffae11670-fe5c-4452-9bfa-f2587daa50b3_774x295.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffae11670-fe5c-4452-9bfa-f2587daa50b3_774x295.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffae11670-fe5c-4452-9bfa-f2587daa50b3_774x295.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">DoorDash x MQ <a href="https://www.marqeta.com/blog/2020/04/20/doordash-marqeta-seamless-payments">[12]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>With DoorDash, restaurants are now able to expand their customer base, while the customers themselves are able to choose from a variety of local cuisines, all from one convenient application, simplifying the takeout process by orders of magnitude. These capabilities were made possible by MQ&#8217;s technology, of which allowed for DoorDash to pay restaurants at their POS, all while keeping a firm focus on fraud mitigation. Delving deeper, DoorDash required the quick issuance of &#8220;red cards&#8221;, of which allowed for their drivers to purchase customer&#8217;s food from restaurants in an expedient manner. The company also required a high level of control over each transaction, the ability to manage fraud using JIT transactions, and a reliable card issuance platform that could be used in fast-paced circumstances as DoorDash scaled across the nation. Not only was MQ able to help the company gain insight over transactions and leverage data to help restaurants learn more about their customer&#8217;s delivery preferences, but they were also able to cater towards the time-sensitive nature of purchases and deliveries made on the platform.&nbsp;</p><p>It is quite evident that MQ&#8217;s dynamic technology platform helps fast-moving companies incorporate payments into their processes in a manner that would not be possible using legacy infrastructure.

This diagram, created by James Ho, does a good job of illustrating the different pieces of the pie that are required to conduct an MQ-involved transaction. Moving on, the company also generates revenue from, albeit a much smaller chunk of their total revenue, <em><strong>Processing Services</strong></em> of which include fees charged for processing services, fraud monitoring capabilities, tokenization services, and other &#8220;add-on&#8221; features, for the lack of a better term.&nbsp;</p><p>With all of these facts considered, we can now delve into what I perceive MQ&#8217;s value proposition is to their customers. In essence, MQ offers companies the ability to create unique card programs all while avoiding the need for tedious interactions with a traditional bank. The archaic processes of old would typically see a company interacting with an institution, of which would act as both the card issuer and issuing bank. MQ&#8217;s technology on the other essentially dismantles this entire process, separating the creation of cards and the authentication required in order to create said cards, enabling companies to create complex card programs in an expedient manner.

This value is unlikely to ever become more than 10% of the aforementioned total. Of additional note is how the constituents of Platform Services Revenue has changed.

Total Compensation Benefits includes things like salaries, bonuses and SBC and is likely to remain the largest component of OPEX going forwards, whereas Other Operating Expenses consists of things ranging from technology costs to marketing and advertising costs.

To get a little more speculative, I am excited about MQ&#8217;s relationship with Affirm, especially when looking at the rocket-fueled trajectory the company has been on of late. In a recent conference call, MQ confirmed that they were partnering with Affirm on their Debit+ effort, as seen quote from Jason Gardner, CEO of MQ, from their most recent CC quote below<a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/11/marqeta-inc-mq-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcript/"> [14]</a>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Yeah, I can confirm that we are powering Affirm's Debit+ card. I can't comment any more beyond that until it's in market, but Affirm has been a great partner of Marqeta for many years, and continuing that partnership with the Debit+ card.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>The debit+ will be the first debit card available in the US that has BNPL services tied directly to it, functionality that would not have been possible without MQ&#8217;s tech. Getting more speculative here, Affirm&#8217;s partnerships with the biggest merchants in the world, specifically Amazon may help MQ reduce their Revenue Concentration risk going forwards and offer a serious long term value proposition. More specifically, Amazon announced yesterday that they will stop accepting visa credit cards that have been issued in the UK. If this action, for whatever reason, were to replicate itself in the US, there would be an obvious opportunity for Affirm to fill a very real void in this space, allowing for MQ, by association to issue cards to fill said void. Regardless of whether or not this happens, MQ is acting as a fundamental layer within the BNPL space that cannot be dispensed with. Therefore if you are bullish on BNPL, I would say you are bullish MQ by association.&nbsp;</p><p>Card applications don&#8217;t stop there. We already understand how MQ can help fuel the processes of Experience Economy companies, so now let&#8217;s take a look at another red-hot industry, cryptocurrency. Digging into the technological applications, MQ&#8217;s instant issuance system allows for card programs to be deployed directly into digital wallets with its network integration, direct deposit and ACH functionality, helping foster cryptocurrency-centered digital banking experiences. As of today, MQ has allowed companies such as Coinbase, Bakkt and Shakepay roll out visa debit cards that allow for customers to spend crypto at point of sale. Delving deeper, Coinbase has been gaining noticeable steam and is catching up to Cash App, on a user satisfaction basis in the United States, as outlined below:&nbsp;</p><div

spare you a law-induced nap, the Durbin Amendment, of which is part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Law, is in essence a piece of regulation that lowers the interchange fees that merchants are obligated to pay banks when a purchase is made using a debit card. However, like many regulations, there exists a loophole around said amendment, of which has beenexploited by Fintech companies in full. More specifically, the Durbin Amendment exempts financial institutions with less than $10B in Assets. What this equates to can be best described in basis points, with Durbin-exempt banks being able to charge 80-105bps + $0.15-$0.20 as a transaction fee whereas Banks with more than $10B in assets are restricted to charging 21cents + 5bps per transaction. This loophole resulted in something astonishing, Fintech companies were able to cater towards the payment requirements of areas such as SMBs by partnering with Durbin-exempt banks, extracting more value from these niches than big banks could hope to. MQ is no different, seeing as they only contract Issuing Banks that are exempt, in order to maximize their interchange fees. Say what you want about the US government, but they aren&#8217;t one to let businesses get away with a free lunch so to speak for very long.  Regardless, it is worth noting that this loophole could close at any time, and both MQ and its clients/counterparts Interchange Fees could be materially affected. </p><div><hr></div><p><strong>9.0 Conclusion</strong></p><p>In summary, MQ represents an opportunity to get exposure to all avenues of fast-moving Modern Fintech ranging from BNPL to Crypto as well as to members of the Experience Economy, ranging from DoorDash to Instacart. This company provides an indispensable service within each of these ecosystems and as such should be a consideration if you are a fan modern card issuing solutions in any capacity. Though not without its risks, the company&#8217;s valuation as well as potential regulation surrounding the Durbin Amendment are all headwinds the company will have to navigate with top notch execution. Regardless, MQ is an enticing story and definitely worth having on your watch list.

Matterport&#8217;s classification of their opportunity is no different, however, it is useful to gloss over in order to understand the vastness of the use-cases that their technology can be applied to, as well as where their industry is with respect to complete digitization. Before delving into the specifics, we must first become familiar with what Matterport deems as a &#8220;Space&#8221;. This term, in essence, represents a room, an entire building, or an area contained therein that has been captured by one continuous scan and is then reconstructed digitally, using captured imagery and spatial data <a href="https://investors.matterport.com/static-files/0f8ee0ee-b534-40f8-afaa-99bcb7e7e549">[2]</a>. A Managed Space would then be a Space, as described above, that has been scanned and managed on Matterport&#8217;s platform.&nbsp; As such, the company could theoretically manage an amount of spaces that greatly exceeds the number of buildings situated within their Total Addressable Market. With these definitions in mind, the company estimates, as of March 2021, that their Total Serviceable Market is approximately 1.3B spaces worldwide. With the company having a sub 5% penetration in this area at the moment, i.e. having only converted 5% of available spaces into managed ones, there is evidently room for improvement as the company expands their reach outside of the real estate, travel and hospitality sectors into other end markets that include retail, insurance and repair, facility management and more.&nbsp; Moving on to the Total Addressable Market, the company estimates that with approximately 4 billion buildings and 20 billion associated spaces situated across the globe, resulting in an approximately $240B Market Opportunity. Although the company is evidently amidst stages of infancy, they lack no ambition in extracting as much value as they can from their Target Market.</p><p>Besides the glaring opportunity to increase the rate of digital adoption in archaic industries such as Real Estate and Insurance Claim Analysis (more on how Matterport enables this in later sections) I believe the company&#8217;s technology intersects very well with the activity we have within and surrounding the &#8220;Metaverse&#8221; of late. The Metaverse, a term that has roots within Science Fiction, can be most easily defined as a version of the internet that is, in essence, a manifestation of actual reality. This construct, which many shrugged off years ago is starting to gain traction, particularly with Facebook&#8217;s recent name change to &#8220;Meta&#8221; and Microsoft&#8217;s announcement of their intent to facilitate metaverse interactions within the Microsoft Cloud and Microsoft Teams ecosystems, cementing the fact that some of the world&#8217;s biggest corporations are taking these developments seriously.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c8c09dd-19b2-459e-8577-f35e2fcd5c08_750x500.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c8c09dd-19b2-459e-8577-f35e2fcd5c08_750x500.png" width="520" height="346.6666666666667" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7c8c09dd-19b2-459e-8577-f35e2fcd5c08_750x500.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:500,&quot;width&quot;:750,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:520,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c8c09dd-19b2-459e-8577-f35e2fcd5c08_750x500.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c8c09dd-19b2-459e-8577-f35e2fcd5c08_750x500.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c8c09dd-19b2-459e-8577-f35e2fcd5c08_750x500.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c8c09dd-19b2-459e-8577-f35e2fcd5c08_750x500.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Facebook &#8594;

One can imagine a organic universe that can be tapped into if desired, of which contains digital items, assets, environments and ecosystems ripe for the taking. Matterport and its ability to transform the physical into the digital, turning bricks into bits, will be able to aid in the creation of this vision, a proposition that is likely to result in an enormous opportunity for value creation. This is more than mere speculation, especially considering that Matterport has already partnered with Facebook in the past, working with Facebook AI to combine their spatial data sets with the training of embodied agents. With best-in-class technology, Matterport is likely to assist some of the world&#8217;s largest companies with the creation of digital spaces in an unparalleled manner.&nbsp;</p><p>Matterport isn&#8217;t just able to facilitate to the creation of an increasingly complex digital world, it is also leverages a series of partnerships to maximize their opportunity to cater towards almost every stage of a physical property&#8217;s lifecycle. These stages can be seen outlined in the image below. For the sake of clarity, I broke down an example partnership in each of these avenues to illustrate the wide net of capabilities the company possesses as well as the many streams of organic growth opportunities they&#8217;re exposing themselves to. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F983567dd-49ca-4308-9b8b-bf79e553c88a_1516x838.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F983567dd-49ca-4308-9b8b-bf79e553c88a_1516x838.png" width="1456" height="805" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/983567dd-49ca-4308-9b8b-bf79e553c88a_1516x838.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:805,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F983567dd-49ca-4308-9b8b-bf79e553c88a_1516x838.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F983567dd-49ca-4308-9b8b-bf79e553c88a_1516x838.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F983567dd-49ca-4308-9b8b-bf79e553c88a_1516x838.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F983567dd-49ca-4308-9b8b-bf79e553c88a_1516x838.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Matterport Property Lifecycle Components Graphic</figcaption></figure></div><p><em><strong>Design</strong></em><strong>:</strong> Matterport has partnered with Autodesk in order to integrate with BIM 360, a prospect that will allow teams integrated with the Autodesk ecosystem to access digital twins of their job sites, further enhancing their design capabilities as a result <a href="https://matterport.com/news/matterport-announces-integration-autodesk-bim-360r#:~:text=SUNNYVALE%2C%20Calif">[5]</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Build</strong></em><strong>:</strong> Procore, one of the most used construction software in the world, offers customers a single point of truth to manage construction drawings and associated documentation.

Despite that fact, the company was still dedicated to enabling the 3D capture of the physical world in a manner that had never been done before. Two years into their campaign to greatly increase the ease at which 3D captures of spaces could occur (in comparison to the traditional process of legacy systems that were monotonous to say the least), Oculus, a company that would later be acquired by Facebook and gain notable notoriety across the tech world, released their first laptop-connected virtual reality headset, as outlined below:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33b9d647-a225-47b9-93ad-a0f95b9b2de9_565x372.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33b9d647-a225-47b9-93ad-a0f95b9b2de9_565x372.png" width="565" height="372" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/33b9d647-a225-47b9-93ad-a0f95b9b2de9_565x372.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:372,&quot;width&quot;:565,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33b9d647-a225-47b9-93ad-a0f95b9b2de9_565x372.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33b9d647-a225-47b9-93ad-a0f95b9b2de9_565x372.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33b9d647-a225-47b9-93ad-a0f95b9b2de9_565x372.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33b9d647-a225-47b9-93ad-a0f95b9b2de9_565x372.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">First Oculus Device <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/arvr-2009-2019-my-decade-with-things-on-my-face/">[9]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Matterport, busy with their own ambitions, noticed immediately and decided to get a devkit shortly after the release of the original Oculus. According to Matt Bell, the co-founder of Matterport, this occurrence resulted in an unexpected synergy between their technologies. Matterport had been working to create a technology that would capture the physical world and represent it digitally whereas Oculus had created a technology that allowed for these digital worlds to be viewed in 3D, acting as a teleporter of sorts to the digital realm <a href="http://www.listedsmrt.com/blog/2016/10/8/a-brief-history-of-matterport-and-virtual-reality">[10]</a>. For the sake of illustration, an excerpt of the first demo Matterport created custom-made for VR viewing can be seen outlined below:</p><div id="vimeo-92778987" class="vimeo-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;92778987&quot;,&quot;videoKey&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/92778987?autoplay=0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></div><p>Flash forward a few months and Matterport continued to launch efforts at capturing the VR opportunity, creating their own dedicated team to find an end-to-end process for Matterport digital twins to be seamlessly tailored to VR. This effort was successful, with Matterport designing the ability to turn 3D content into VR content, with the company providing users with free access to these capabilities in between 2016-2017 to encourage adoption. Today, accessing VR capabilities through the Matterport platform has never been easier, with the ability for spaces to be viewed directly through Oculus Web Browsers, as outlined below:</p><div

of what you may think about VR, this technology has real-world use-cases that are just starting to come into fruition within multiple industries and adoption is unlikely to slow down in the coming years. When combining Matterport&#8217;s digital twins with the ability to view them in a completely immersive manner, the company is directing efforts at building a Google for the physical world, or in other words the capabilities for one to search and explore almost any physical location across the Globe seamlessly. It is exciting to say the least.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>4.0 Technology Breakdown</strong></p><p>Put simply, Matterport and their associated technology platform allows for spatial data to be collected from a variety of capture devices in order to take a building that exists in the physical realm and transform it into a digital entity. By creating a navigable, dimensionally accurate and photorealistic digital twin, Matterport subscribers are then able to extract information and insights that were previously unavailable through traditional mediums.

When one thinks about the Real Estate industry in general, visions of blinding technological innovation do not usually come to mind. More specifically, the manner in which some RE operations are usually conducted are archaic to say the least. Before Matterport, if a customer desired to assess their building or space, they would have had to either conduct an in-person site visit, or rely on some form of CAD software that usually leaves much to be desired in terms of the accuracy of the space. With Matterport&#8217;s platform on the other hand things have changed, scrapping the need for site visits or for floor plans or photographs to be used to extract insights. The process of digital incorporation starts simply, with customers scanning their space with different technologies, ranging from LiDar to 3D and 360 degree cameras to smartphones.

To date, the company has captured over 10 billion+ SF (Square Feet) of space, amounting to more than 3 billion unique data points. These data points are then utilized to create amazingly accurate 3D twins, of which exhibit vibrance, dimensional accuracy and the characteristics of the area that would not be visible within a CAD drawing or a photograph. Transforming data into a digital twin is made possible by Matterport Cortex. This AI-powered engine takes in data, of which consists of information regarding geometries, fixtures and conditions etc. and applies Spatial Indexing to different points in order to create the space. More specifically, this process consists of deep-learning, dynamic 3D reconstruction, computer vision and advanced image processing in order to acquire the necessary amount of detail needed for the 3D Twin.&nbsp; Starting off with Deep Learning, Matterport leverages their neural network data architecture in order to compare each 3D model against the millions of datapoints provided by aggregated information obtained from various buildings, spaces and comments from the thousands of subscribers leveraging Matterport&#8217;s platform. These capabilities allow for building configurations and environments to be created with notable consistency. Dynamic 3D reconstruction is the process by where 2D visuals and static images are transformed into a 3D representation of the space. More specifically, real-time spatial alignment algorithms work alongside the company&#8217;s deep learning processes reliant on millions of data points to create a previews of the model in progress, all in real time. Cortex also relies upon computer vision, which in essence leverages a series of features to enhance the value of different digital twins. Features include adding measurements to different objects or components of a room, the creation of custom videos and walkthroughs as well as object and face recognition.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98f4ae50-8192-4a85-b75e-4a791b8de552_1600x1600.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98f4ae50-8192-4a85-b75e-4a791b8de552_1600x1600.png" width="474" height="474" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/98f4ae50-8192-4a85-b75e-4a791b8de552_1600x1600.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1456,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:474,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98f4ae50-8192-4a85-b75e-4a791b8de552_1600x1600.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98f4ae50-8192-4a85-b75e-4a791b8de552_1600x1600.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98f4ae50-8192-4a85-b75e-4a791b8de552_1600x1600.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98f4ae50-8192-4a85-b75e-4a791b8de552_1600x1600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Matterport Dynamic Reconstruction <a href="https://matterport.com/cortex-ai">[14]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Lastly, the company has a series of photography algorithms that ensure the digital twin is not just a computerized model, but is of professional grade quality. These algorithms include dynamic tone mapping, saturation adjustments and more, all allowing for high quality 3D image capture to occur with the press of a button. With all of this functionality in mind, it is evident that these proprietary solutions offer an interesting value proposition to Matterport&#8217;s clients, of which would be difficult to replicate via an in-house development effort. Similar to other AI/ML centered companies, the bigger Matterport&#8217;s dataset gets, the better their technology is likely to become and the more enticing it becomes for both customers and developers to leverage Matterport&#8217;s services and product suite. With all of these factors in mind, we now understand the <em><strong>Matterport Capture </strong></em>offering and the technology behind it.

The company primarily derives value in this area through the sale of their Pro2 camera, of which retails for the price of $2,795 (at the time of writing) <a href="https://matterport.com/cameras/pro2-3D-camera">[19]</a>. In addition, in order to provide optionality to their customers, Matterport sells capture devices manufactured by third parties, marking up the cost of these items accordingly before their sale. <em><strong>Product Revenue </strong></em>is the second largest constituent of Total Revenue following its <em><strong>Subscription Revenue </strong></em>counterpart and is likely to continue to act as a customer acquisition tool of sorts. More specifically, if one is seeking out a capture device, becoming acquainted with the Matterport platform and subscription service as a result is the logical next step.</p><p>Lastly, the company also earns money through the provision of professional services. Although Matterport&#8217;s capture technology and associated ecosystem is straightforward and relatively easy to become accustomed to, some customers, particularly if they are working on a larger project, may require assistance from Matterport. Encompassed within <em><strong>Services Revenue, </strong></em>the company charges clients for scheduling and performing a professional scan of their property. This process is expedient, with a 72-hour gold standard being set for when the customer will receive their finalized 3D digital twin after the scheduled appointment has been completed.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F762fd5b9-1d9a-47ce-b6a6-9d8455033bfa_1500x493.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F762fd5b9-1d9a-47ce-b6a6-9d8455033bfa_1500x493.png" width="1456" height="479" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/762fd5b9-1d9a-47ce-b6a6-9d8455033bfa_1500x493.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:479,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F762fd5b9-1d9a-47ce-b6a6-9d8455033bfa_1500x493.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F762fd5b9-1d9a-47ce-b6a6-9d8455033bfa_1500x493.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F762fd5b9-1d9a-47ce-b6a6-9d8455033bfa_1500x493.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F762fd5b9-1d9a-47ce-b6a6-9d8455033bfa_1500x493.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Matterport Services <a href="https://matterport.com/capture-services">[20]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>In summary, Matterport amalgamates a variety of different revenue sources in order to create a full experiential solution centered around their technology.

With the relatively one-off nature of hardware sales in mind, it is evident that Subscription Revenue will be an important part of Matterport&#8217;s growth going forwards. With these values increasing 36.12% on a YoY basis in comparison to the 4.28% increase in Product Revenue, it is quite evident that the company is executing on this growth plan well and will likely continue to reap the benefits of heightened recurring revenues going forwards. It is also worth noting the behavior of the two less noticeable Revenue sources, License Revenue and Services Revenue and how these values have changed. Starting with License Revenue, this metric decreased approximately 96% on a YoY basis, only accounting for 0.43% of Total Revenues. Matterport&#8217;s management was adamant that this value will likely to remain low in the upcoming quarter, due to the sporadic manner in which these transactions occur/are recognized. Being that as it may, hope in this area is not lost, with the company noting in their ER call that they intend to close a relatively substantial license revenue agreement with a client that is recurring in nature and will thus be recognized in the Subscription segment. Moving on, Services Revenue saw a 41% increase on a YoY basis as a result of heightened activity with in-app purchases and capturing services, accounting for ~12% of Total Revenues for the quarter.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Cost of Revenue&nbsp;</em></p><p>The change in Matterport&#8217;s Cost of Revenue (COR) can be seen outlined by the image below:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e2e2132-07cd-47c2-9633-beb4186fc9d1_480x289.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e2e2132-07cd-47c2-9633-beb4186fc9d1_480x289.png" width="480" height="289" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6e2e2132-07cd-47c2-9633-beb4186fc9d1_480x289.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:289,&quot;width&quot;:480,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e2e2132-07cd-47c2-9633-beb4186fc9d1_480x289.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e2e2132-07cd-47c2-9633-beb4186fc9d1_480x289.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e2e2132-07cd-47c2-9633-beb4186fc9d1_480x289.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e2e2132-07cd-47c2-9633-beb4186fc9d1_480x289.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Change in Total Cost of Revenue</figcaption></figure></div><p>Coming in at approximately $13.5M for the quarter, COR increased approximately 34.6% on a YoY basis in comparison to the ~10.3% YoY increase in Total Revenues.

Net Income and Operating Income both decreased significantly, coming in at $(44)M and $(168)M for the quarter, respectively. The change in Net Income was primarily driven by the change in the fair value of warrants liabilities and contingent earn-out liability, i.e. one-time items associated with the company going public. Moving on, the increase in Operating Loss YoY was a result of previously outlined OPEX increases and should continue to be monitored going forwards. The change in the company&#8217;s Gross Profit, Net Income (adjusted this quarter to account for non-recurring items, all other quarters non-adjusted) and Operating Margins can be seen outlined below:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde572e33-dcae-4971-9cee-054e3eb76903_480x289.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde572e33-dcae-4971-9cee-054e3eb76903_480x289.png" width="480" height="289" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/de572e33-dcae-4971-9cee-054e3eb76903_480x289.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:289,&quot;width&quot;:480,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde572e33-dcae-4971-9cee-054e3eb76903_480x289.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde572e33-dcae-4971-9cee-054e3eb76903_480x289.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde572e33-dcae-4971-9cee-054e3eb76903_480x289.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde572e33-dcae-4971-9cee-054e3eb76903_480x289.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Change in Margins</figcaption></figure></div><p>The company&#8217;s Gross Margins decreased slightly QoQ from the 60% range to ~51%.

Although more data is needed to draw a definitive conclusion on these happenings, it is worrisome given the fact that the company will need to rely on Subscription Revenues to fuel future growth. Not only is generating new subscribers important but extracting more value from existing subs is imperative to Matterport&#8217;s trajectory.

More specifically Matterport announced partnerships with the likes of PTC Vuforia an augmented software offering designed to provide training in immersive 3d environments, SIMLAB a company focused on the digitization of design/construction processes and increased activities with Meta AI Research, which is developing AI systems analyzing the physical/virtual worlds. All of these partnerships are likely to expand the use-cases of Matterport&#8217;s technology as well as help to spur adoption across industries.&nbsp;</p><p>Now to get a little more speculative, I would like to discuss the trajectory of where I think Matterport will end up down the road. More specifically, I find it likely that Matterport ends up as a buy-out candidate, especially when considering the activity that the likes of Google, Facebook and Microsoft are displaying within the metaverse. Meta&#8217;s activity (formerly Facebook) is evidently the most notable, I mean it isn&#8217;t every day a trillion dollar changes the name of their business to encompass a gamble they&#8217;re making on the future trajectory of the world. Matterport would evidently add value here by enabling the creation of of photorealistic spaces within the metaverse. There are a lot of potential directions this could go, but, seeing a deal I would have never envisioned happening yesterday, it affirms my hunch that big corporations are willing to engage in partnerships to make this vision a reality. More specifically, Microsoft and Meta announced that they plan on integrating their enterprise offerings, Teams and Workplace, allowing for individuals to access content from both ecosystems without the need to switch between different apps. If these two behemoths are willing to partner, I see no reason for Matterport not to pay a bigger role in their ambitions going forwards. </p><p>Out of all the aforementioned companies, I believe Google&#8217;s activities in this realm intersect the best with Matterport&#8217;s capabilities.  More specifically, I believe Matterport&#8217;s Digital Spaces mesh perfectly with the company&#8217;s Google Maps offering. This proposition isn&#8217;t too far fetched, especially when considering the amount of AR-related features Google has been launching of late as well as the recent effort on Matterport&#8217;s end to integrate with the Android Ecosystem. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddf6ba56-89a7-4507-a3fa-730e2d5fef6f_660x440.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddf6ba56-89a7-4507-a3fa-730e2d5fef6f_660x440.png" width="660" height="440" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ddf6ba56-89a7-4507-a3fa-730e2d5fef6f_660x440.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:440,&quot;width&quot;:660,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddf6ba56-89a7-4507-a3fa-730e2d5fef6f_660x440.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddf6ba56-89a7-4507-a3fa-730e2d5fef6f_660x440.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddf6ba56-89a7-4507-a3fa-730e2d5fef6f_660x440.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddf6ba56-89a7-4507-a3fa-730e2d5fef6f_660x440.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Google Maps AR</figcaption></figure></div><p>With all of these speculations in mind, I think the assertion that a buyout occurring in the future is not made out of lunacy, but time will if this hunch is corroborated.

In essence, these regions are becoming increasingly important within a more interconnected World. Not only is technology spurring higher rates of engagement between developed and developing countries, it is also giving certain demographics access to goods and services that were previously unavailable to them. For some additional background, the amount of middle class individuals in Emerging Markets greatly trumped those in developed countries, with 679M middle class households measured in the former in comparison to 176M in the latter <a href="https://www.euromonitor.com/article/the-rise-of-a-higher-income-middle-class-in-emerging-markets#:~:text=The%20rise%20of%20a%20new,the%20period%20through%20to%202030">[4]</a>. This demographic has historically been very involved with retail trade and more recently, e-commerce interactions. When coupled with the staggering GDP growth that is anticipated to occur in Emerging Markets vs. Developed Markets, i.e. how their GDP Growth CAGR Forecast for 2020-2025 is anticipated to be 4.9%, almost 3X the size of developed nations CAGR during the same time frame, there is evidently a surplus of value ripe for the taking in the e-commerce realm, as well as for the companies that help facilitate transactions. While that sounds all fine and dandy, there are a series of struggles that exist with offering solutions for the aforementioned individuals. Despite the massive size of Global Network Card systems, of which facilitated approximately $477B in purchase transactions for goods and services in 2020 <a href="https://nilsonreport.com/mention/1428/1link/">[5]</a>, there are key differences in the ability of legacy payment methods to cater towards the shopping habits of those within the US and Europe, and those situated Internationally. For the sake of illustration, it is quite clear that in the US both credit and debit cards are both widely held and utilized. According to a recent Nielsen Report, it was estimated that almost 82.2% and 71.7% of the adult population within the United States held debit or credit cards, respectively <a href="https://dlocal.gcs-web.com/static-files/96c588b5-c033-4b87-bd73-ed32765d6d15">[6]</a>. The companies that provide these instruments, though successful in highly developed regions, have struggled expanding their reach Internationally . This assertion is corroborated further when looking at the fact that banking penetration often falls below 20% in several emerging markets, with inhabitants of these regions preferring to use cash-payment systems, digital wallets or transfers. In other words, members of these regions often leverage local payment methods rather than alternatives with international capabilities/functionality, with over 83% of total e-commerce expenditure in 15 developing regions occurring through the medium of the former, as surveyed by AMI <a href="https://investor.dlocal.com/">[7]</a>.&nbsp; An outline of some interesting payment statistics within global markets, more specifically the sources of aggregate e-commerce payment volumes, can be seen outlined within the table below:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6c055a4-956a-489c-b912-57cb90ef988a_633x241.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6c055a4-956a-489c-b912-57cb90ef988a_633x241.png" width="633" height="241" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a6c055a4-956a-489c-b912-57cb90ef988a_633x241.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:241,&quot;width&quot;:633,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:22051,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6c055a4-956a-489c-b912-57cb90ef988a_633x241.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6c055a4-956a-489c-b912-57cb90ef988a_633x241.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6c055a4-956a-489c-b912-57cb90ef988a_633x241.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6c055a4-956a-489c-b912-57cb90ef988a_633x241.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>With the above values in mind, there is an evident opportunity for solutions that are compatible with local payment methods.

As an example, Brazil shows only 6%  of transactions occurring cross-border, despite having one of the highest e-commerce growth rates in the world. Poor penetration in these areas may be a result of the complexities that arise from making payments in these regions. Associated transactions require strict adherence to challenging frameworks, volatile FX exchange rates, relationships with local institutions, and technological capabilities that facilitate transaction settlements while abiding by different tax and regulatory environments simultaneously. As such, these multi-faceted processes pose real challenge to merchants, evidently presenting themselves as a tedious and difficult task to complete in-house. There are very few businesses that can offer merchants this functionality in an effective and cost-efficient manner, presenting an evident opportunity for dLocal to capitalize on. In summary, with the growth of e-commerce, increasing rate of individuals who desire to interact with merchants and bolstering fast growth in certain regions around the world, there exists a real need for payment systems to be able to function within these environments. dLocal and its technology aims to be the company that benefits from these tailwinds, building solutions that cater towards both local and cross-border payment needs and building themselves a very impressive moat while doing it.&nbsp;</p><p>With all of these happenings in mind, let&#8217;s take a closer look at what exactly dLocal&#8217;s products offer clients.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>3.0 What dLocal Offers Merchants</strong></p><p>dLocal targets businesses through what they denote as their <em><strong>&#8220;One D-Local&#8221; </strong></em>model. In essence, this  represents the company&#8217;s go-to-market strategy, and contains their associated technology, intellectual property, and a variety of business functionality/capabilities. Clients can gain access to all of this functionality, encompassed within the dLocal platform, through the use of a single API and are billed for its use through a single contract, but more on that later. In order to understand what dLocal offers their clients, which in the company&#8217;s case are Global Enterprise Merchants, we must first split their offerings into those centered around the facilitation of <em><strong>Pay-in</strong></em> and <em><strong>Pay-out </strong></em>and <em><strong>Marketplace </strong></em>processes. These processes represent, in my opinion, the bulk of dLocal&#8217;s technology value proposition and as such should be the primary focus of analysis. All other functionality can be thought of as icing on top of the company&#8217;s proverbial cake, and will be broken down in the latter parts of this section. <em><strong>Pay-In </strong></em>processes can be loosely defined as a instances by where dLocal assists Global Merchants with getting paid whereas <em><strong>Pay-Out </strong></em>processes on the other hand sees dLocal assisting merchants with making payments online in a safe and expedient manner. <em><strong>Marketplace </strong></em>allows for marketplace sellers, of which are intertwined with an ecommerce platform/company&#8217;s network, to accept local cards and payment methods directly through their platform.<em><strong>&nbsp; </strong></em>The technological enablement of these processes is centered around dLocal being able to navigate a complex environment of regulations and decipher a complex web of systems that lacks uniformity when moving from region to region. Being that dLocal facilitates interaction between consumer and merchant in approximately 30 different countries, the company&#8217;s technology allows merchants to rest easy on the fact that their platform:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Adheres to local regulatory and tax requirements</p></li><li><p>Focuses on offering end-user transparency and security</p></li><li><p>Mitigates inherent fraud risk&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Provides the ability to leverage transaction data to gain valuable insights</p></li><li><p>Provides the opportunity for the interaction between Global Merchant and local emerging market partners&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>With this functionality in mind, let&#8217;s take a closer look at the <em><strong>Pay Ins,</strong></em> <em><strong>Pay Outs</strong></em> and <em><strong>Marketplace</strong></em> processes, respectively.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Pay-In</strong></em></p><p>dLocal assists Global Merchants with accepting payments in different emerging countries, supporting local payment methods commonly used within each region. These methods include but are not limited to both international and local credit cards, bank transfers, cash payments, direct debit and the use of different e-wallets. <em><strong>Pay-In </strong></em>functionality, as provided by dLocal&#8217;s API, can be split into three main segments, each of which can be seen outlined in further detail below.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Credit Card Payments</em></p><p>dLocal allows companies to accept credit cards, both of the international and local variety all while maintaining a focus on PCI compliance. This compliance standard is mandated by credit card companies in order to uphold a high degree of security within transactions <a href="https://www.controlcase.com/what-are-the-12-requirements-of-pci-dss-compliance/">[8].</a> In order to reduce the friction associated with Merchants accepting credit cards, merchants can either interact with dLocal on exchange payment on a server to server basis, or, if they are not PCI compliant, they can leverage the company&#8217;s Smart Field technology. More specifically, Smart Fields are essentially an iframe that can be incorporated with a merchant&#8217;s website that is adherent to PCI standards.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F459441d3-e892-41e0-8a84-7fd5801f4e57_1600x834.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F459441d3-e892-41e0-8a84-7fd5801f4e57_1600x834.png" width="1456" height="759" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/459441d3-e892-41e0-8a84-7fd5801f4e57_1600x834.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:759,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F459441d3-e892-41e0-8a84-7fd5801f4e57_1600x834.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F459441d3-e892-41e0-8a84-7fd5801f4e57_1600x834.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F459441d3-e892-41e0-8a84-7fd5801f4e57_1600x834.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F459441d3-e892-41e0-8a84-7fd5801f4e57_1600x834.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">dLocal Smart Field iFrame Example <a href="https://docs.dlocal.com/products/smart-fields">[9]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Installments</em></p><p>Merchants also have the option of accepting payments with installments. Similar to BNPL functionality I have outlined in-depth in previous deep-dives, the Merchant receives the full amount they are owed at settlement (from dLocal) and then dLocal will be responsible for ensuring they are repaid in full from the consumer. This no-risk process (for Merchants) has benefits ranging from boosting average order value, decreasing purchasing friction and much more.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Alternate Payment Methods</em></p><p>As previously mentioned, APM dLocal supports transaction methods that range from Bank Transfers to Cash Payments.

These extra titbits of functionality can be listed as follows: <em><strong>Fraud Prevention, Direct Issuing </strong></em>and<em><strong> Integration</strong></em>, each of which can be seen outlined below.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Fraud Prevention</strong></em></p><p>dLocal offers a holistic approach to risk and fraud management, providing flexible solutions that can be incorporated with the aforementioned payment functionalities outlined above. The company offers merchants three solutions to select from, of which cater towards different needs. These solutions are <em>Smart Defense, Defense Manager </em>and <em>Chargeback Guarantee.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Smart Defense&nbsp;</em></p><p>dLocal provides merchants access to a host of AI/ML models that are able to track and score payment transactions. AI/ML models leverage a multitude of data points, i.e. the millions of transactions that occur within dLocal&#8217;s network and across merchants situated across various industries. As such, merchants that utilize <em>Smart Defense</em> are then able to pinpoint suspicious transactions, improving their ability to detect fraud and increase approval rates as a result, essentially automating fraud protection as a result.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Defense Manager</em></p><p>This <em><strong>Fraud Prevention</strong></em> constituent is aimed at merchants that already have their own fraud prevention in-house. This segment can essentially be thought of as an extension of <em>Smart Defense</em>, i.e. rather than automating the majority of the fraud recognition merchants are provided access to an intuitive administrator dashboard, of which gives greater control over transaction approval and rejection.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Chargeback Guarantee</em></p><p>Through <em>Chargeback Guarantee, </em>dLocal provides merchants a completely managed fraud prevention system, in exchange for a fixed rate. The company absorbs all of the headaches and problems associated with risk management processes, guaranteeing merchants free fraudulent chargebacks if they arise during transactions.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Direct Issuing</strong></em></p><p>With dLocal&#8217;s <em><strong>Direct Issuing</strong></em> functionality, merchants are able to create e-wallets that behave similarly to bank accounts for their consumers as well as issue prepaid cards that are associated with their brand. With both physical and virtual brand-related cards able to be issued, associated users will then be able to spend the funds on services, products, groceries, withdrawal funds from ATMs, pay their bills and even send money to their peers, all in their locally denominated currency. Similarly to previously outlined technological capabilities, all of this can be done utilizing dLocal&#8217;s API. Additional functionality includes the ability for merchants to re-issue cards when expired or block their use if stolen and instantly credit funds to branded cards (in comparison to dreadfully long traditional settlement times). If you think about the variety of instances that require merchants to pay their supply-side user base such as drivers and freelancers in local currency, this functionality definitely has wide use-cases associated with it.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Integration&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p>Lastly, and arguably an interesting addition to the company&#8217;s value proposition, dLocal supports integration with merchant ecosystems that include <em>Shopify</em>, <em>Lightspeed </em>(for Mexican Merchants), and <em>Tienda Nube</em> (Argentinian-based SME SaaS platform). When considering the sheer size GMV that occurs within each of these ecosystems, dLocal evidently will be able to generate substantial amounts of LTV through this functionality. In addition, dLocal is able to be integrated with merchants that support <em>Google Pay </em>on their platform. Though second tier to Apple Pay, <em>Google Pay </em>has approximately 150M users worldwide <a href="https://www.livemint.com/technology/apps/google-pay-users-in-us-can-now-transfer-money-to-india-singapore-11620749882168.html">[11]</a>, and dLocal&#8217;s compatibility with this payment method will be another spurring factor for reducing friction associated with merchants conducting global e-commerce processes.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eabbea9-ad9b-45b2-b430-7221de6c0aa9_798x588.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eabbea9-ad9b-45b2-b430-7221de6c0aa9_798x588.png" width="440" height="324.2105263157895" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1eabbea9-ad9b-45b2-b430-7221de6c0aa9_798x588.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:588,&quot;width&quot;:798,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:440,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eabbea9-ad9b-45b2-b430-7221de6c0aa9_798x588.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eabbea9-ad9b-45b2-b430-7221de6c0aa9_798x588.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eabbea9-ad9b-45b2-b430-7221de6c0aa9_798x588.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1eabbea9-ad9b-45b2-b430-7221de6c0aa9_798x588.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">dLocal Google Pay Support <a href="https://docs.dlocal.com/guides/google-pay">[12]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Now that we have a better understanding of what dLocal offers merchants, let&#8217;s take a look at how exactly they make money from it.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>4.0 How dLocal makes $$$</strong></p><p>As previously mentioned, the company prides itself on having created an easily digestible business model, which the company denotes as the <em>&#8220;One dLocal model&#8221;</em>.

This simplicity is corroborated when digging deeper into how a merchant creates a relationship with the company. More specifically when a merchant is looking to leverage dLocal&#8217;s technology, the primary route of contact will be to reach out to the company&#8217;s sales team, detail certain aspects of their business, both operational and otherwise, as well as specify the solution they wish to use (pay-ins, pay-outs or direct issuing).

In addition, the company charges FX conversion service fees for cross-border payments. Lastly, dLocal charges Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) fees to customers for any services they provide, these include fees for leveraging the company&#8217;s fraud/risk-mitigation and tax/regulatory abidance functionality as well as processing and settlement fees, to name a few.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Now that we have a better understanding of how dLocal makes money, let&#8217;s take a look at some key milestones that the company can bolster across their relatively short lifespan so far, since I believe it is indicative of potential early stages of hypergrowth.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>5.0 Trajectory of the Company (So Far)&nbsp;</strong></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff27cfa93-b84e-4ad6-877f-f49f0e30f814_641x745.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff27cfa93-b84e-4ad6-877f-f49f0e30f814_641x745.png" width="545" height="633.424336973479" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f27cfa93-b84e-4ad6-877f-f49f0e30f814_641x745.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:745,&quot;width&quot;:641,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:545,&quot;bytes&quot;:153089,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff27cfa93-b84e-4ad6-877f-f49f0e30f814_641x745.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff27cfa93-b84e-4ad6-877f-f49f0e30f814_641x745.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff27cfa93-b84e-4ad6-877f-f49f0e30f814_641x745.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff27cfa93-b84e-4ad6-877f-f49f0e30f814_641x745.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Key Company Milestones <a href="https://dlocal.gcs-web.com/static-files/45f57198-f64f-4d93-8353-c3de4d085f25">[14]</a></figcaption></figure></div><div><hr></div><p><strong>6.0 Financial Analysis&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In order to get a better understanding of where the company is at financially, I will be analyzing their Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement up to and including Q2&#8217;21.

Regardless, with NRR expected to come in for Q3&#8217;21 in the 170-180% range, showcasing the likely stability in revenue generation to be expected in quarters to come as well as overall customer contentment.&nbsp;Lastly, it is worth noting the geographic concentration in the company&#8217;s revenue.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e7c9b0a-fde8-4a3e-808c-30b9aedbc347_480x289.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e7c9b0a-fde8-4a3e-808c-30b9aedbc347_480x289.png" width="480" height="289" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3e7c9b0a-fde8-4a3e-808c-30b9aedbc347_480x289.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:289,&quot;width&quot;:480,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e7c9b0a-fde8-4a3e-808c-30b9aedbc347_480x289.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e7c9b0a-fde8-4a3e-808c-30b9aedbc347_480x289.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e7c9b0a-fde8-4a3e-808c-30b9aedbc347_480x289.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e7c9b0a-fde8-4a3e-808c-30b9aedbc347_480x289.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Geographic Revenue Concentration - Q2&#8217;21</figcaption></figure></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc5dc11a-63bd-4e00-97ce-d701c8031b47_480x289.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc5dc11a-63bd-4e00-97ce-d701c8031b47_480x289.png" width="480" height="289" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/dc5dc11a-63bd-4e00-97ce-d701c8031b47_480x289.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:289,&quot;width&quot;:480,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc5dc11a-63bd-4e00-97ce-d701c8031b47_480x289.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc5dc11a-63bd-4e00-97ce-d701c8031b47_480x289.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc5dc11a-63bd-4e00-97ce-d701c8031b47_480x289.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc5dc11a-63bd-4e00-97ce-d701c8031b47_480x289.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Geographic Revenue Concentration - Q2&#8217;20</figcaption></figure></div><p>As the above figures illustrate, LatAm Revenue has become a larger constituent of Total Revenue YoY, increasing from 84% of Revenues to 91%.

This 405% YoY increase was a result, primarily, of costs associated with the company&#8217;s secondary portion of their IPO as well as an increase in salaries due to the fact that they doubled their headcount YoY. In Q2&#8217;20 G&amp;A expenses were approximately 13% of Total Revenues in comparison to 23% in Q2&#8217;21. It is reasonable to conclude that Total OPEX is likely to approach sub 20% of Total Revenues as the company&#8217;s operations continue to hone and as one-off expenses are removed from the sum of the whole, however, for now, the increase in Total OPEX is not problematic and is occurring a result of an increase in business scale and going public.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Margins and Profitability</em></p><p>In order to gauge the company&#8217;s profitability, let&#8217;s take a look at dLocal&#8217;s Gross Profit and Net Income and how these values have changed over the last few quarters:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd208b0ea-fdc2-414f-98eb-cac7fb87bb98_480x289.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd208b0ea-fdc2-414f-98eb-cac7fb87bb98_480x289.png" width="480" height="289" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d208b0ea-fdc2-414f-98eb-cac7fb87bb98_480x289.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:289,&quot;width&quot;:480,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd208b0ea-fdc2-414f-98eb-cac7fb87bb98_480x289.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd208b0ea-fdc2-414f-98eb-cac7fb87bb98_480x289.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd208b0ea-fdc2-414f-98eb-cac7fb87bb98_480x289.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd208b0ea-fdc2-414f-98eb-cac7fb87bb98_480x289.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Change in Profitability Measures (Thousands)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Gross Profit increased 193% on a YoY basis, compared to the 142% and 139% increases in Operating Profit and Net Income, respectively.

You may be asking yourself why this has been decreasing slightly over the last few quarters. One must understand the fact that the company has pricing tiers set with their largest merchants. What this means is that as the merchants transact at higher volumes in emerging markets, take rate will usually decrease as per the agreement between dLocal and merchant. As such, when looking at dLocal&#8217;s high NRR, take rate is likely to remain in the high 3% to low 4% range for the near future given where their large merchant partners are with respect to their contracts. When comparing this take rate with typical credit card companies (upper end of their processing fee ranges), dLocal obviously extracts more value from their GMV, an encouraging fact given the infancy of the company&#8217;s growth trajectory:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3795f3c-bf75-451f-b628-ee60b783bdd2_481x289.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3795f3c-bf75-451f-b628-ee60b783bdd2_481x289.png" width="481" height="289" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a3795f3c-bf75-451f-b628-ee60b783bdd2_481x289.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:289,&quot;width&quot;:481,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3795f3c-bf75-451f-b628-ee60b783bdd2_481x289.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3795f3c-bf75-451f-b628-ee60b783bdd2_481x289.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3795f3c-bf75-451f-b628-ee60b783bdd2_481x289.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3795f3c-bf75-451f-b628-ee60b783bdd2_481x289.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Take Rate Comparison - dLocal and Credit Card Companies</figcaption></figure></div><p>Lastly, it is important to understand the company&#8217;s NRR and just how high this value is relative to its peers.

GLBE, similarly to dLocal, is focused on helping merchants expand into and conduct e-commerce processes in emerging markets. However, GLBE, unlike dLocal, attempts to cast a wider net over this opportunity and suffers as a result, in my opinion. More specifically, GLBE generates Revenue from two business segments, Service Fees and Fulfillment Revenue. Service Fees, much like dLocal, are fees generated as a percentage of GMV, charged to merchants as compensation for processing payments/transactions in different locales. Fulfillment Revenue on the other hand is generated through the company&#8217;s offerings of shipping and handling services for merchants in various emerging markets. As outlined below, the company derives a large part of their Revenue from Fulfillment Services, with 63% of Total Revenues being attributable to this source in 2020.

In a world that is becoming ever inter-connected, the sheer volume of the growth in certain emerging markets, and the ability for dLocal&#8217;s products to reduce the difficulties associated with expanding e-commerce operations into locations that are vastly different from the west, I believe there is an undeniable value proposition here. I have been wanting exposure to LatAm e-commerce for a while now and I believe this business intersects well with my newfound knowledge of the payment tech industry as well as my desire to increase my allocations toward businesses in high-growth stages quite perfectly. When viewing the fact that dLocal derives the majority of their revenues from activity in the LatAm region, as well as the continued growth that is expected to occur over the next few years, I believe dLocal will be able to leverage their existing relationships with merchants new and old, and conduct higher rates of payment volumes as these entities look to increase their exposure to this region.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cd7631b-b347-4c6a-a6d5-33528438958f_638x237.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cd7631b-b347-4c6a-a6d5-33528438958f_638x237.png" width="638" height="237" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5cd7631b-b347-4c6a-a6d5-33528438958f_638x237.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:237,&quot;width&quot;:638,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:13435,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cd7631b-b347-4c6a-a6d5-33528438958f_638x237.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cd7631b-b347-4c6a-a6d5-33528438958f_638x237.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cd7631b-b347-4c6a-a6d5-33528438958f_638x237.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cd7631b-b347-4c6a-a6d5-33528438958f_638x237.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>With Latin America bolstering the highest growth of any region (beating out the APAC region for the first time since 2010) as well as the fact that total LatAm e-commerce sales are expected to reach $160B by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 17.15% between the 2021-2025 forecast period, I believe dLocal is well set up to capitalize on the increased payment activity that is likely to need facilitating in the area as a result. With the fact that the company just recently completed a secondary offering at $52/share, as well as their evident and consistent profitability, a rare phenomenon in the fintech industry as a whole, I believe the risk/reward is great here for an excellent company.&nbsp;Lastly, the company has been and will likely continue to be active with expansion into new emerging markets. Yesterday the company, announced that they had entered into Thailand, El Salvador, an effort that will see them reach 93M new consumers, of which had a combined 2020 e-commerce revenue of $26B, as well as offer merchants another reason to expand their e-commerce operations with the help of dLocal&#8217;s payment API. </p><p>I acknowledge this allocation is not without its risks. The first risk that investors should be aware of is the lockup period that is due to expire&nbsp; on 11/30/2021. This expiration period usually results in some downwards selling pressure on the stock in the short-term. This phenomenon can be viewed with many high-profile IPOs, with the example of Uber outlined below:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa918ba68-99ba-4c8c-95bd-3f230ff61b00_896x551.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa918ba68-99ba-4c8c-95bd-3f230ff61b00_896x551.png" width="896" height="551" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a918ba68-99ba-4c8c-95bd-3f230ff61b00_896x551.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:551,&quot;width&quot;:896,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa918ba68-99ba-4c8c-95bd-3f230ff61b00_896x551.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa918ba68-99ba-4c8c-95bd-3f230ff61b00_896x551.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa918ba68-99ba-4c8c-95bd-3f230ff61b00_896x551.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa918ba68-99ba-4c8c-95bd-3f230ff61b00_896x551.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">UBER Price Action After Lockup Example</figcaption></figure></div><p> Plenty of other examples can be found on the web if you are curious. Although this doesn&#8217;t guarantee negative price-action of any kind, it is worth keeping on eye on if you&#8217;re looking to start a position in the near term.  Lastly, I will be focused on monitoring two additional risks. The first and evidently the most glaring is the valuation of dLocal. With the EV/S multiple like dLocal&#8217;s there is usually not a lot of room for error with management&#8217;s execution. The company has been doing a great job as of late but regardless any misstep will likely result in multiple compression. The second will be the macroeconomic situations of all the emerging markets that the company is exposed to, particularly LatAm, of which could negatively impact the ability for merchants to conduct business successfully in these regions. As such, I will be continually monitoring all of these factors and changing my thesis if new data points suggest a call for action.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>10.0 Conclusion </strong></p><p>Businesses that turn chaos into order are some of my favorite to invest it. Whether it be corporations that turn their companies complex web of data into something tangible that can have value extracted from it, such as Palantir, to companies that that are changing the status quo of how payments are conducted, like Square and Affirm, companies that fulfill a real and untapped need are extremely valuable. With some of the world&#8217;s largest merchants and businesses looking to expand their reach across the Globe, many have encountered hindrance as a result of complexities of payment infrastructure in emerging markets. dLocal&#8217;s easy-to-use technology, of which can accessed simply from one API, allows merchants to navigate new waters in a way that would have not been possible previously. dLocal is coasting along on some of the largest tailwinds the world has ever seen, i.e. the change in the very fabric of the way retail trade is conducted, via e-commerce, as well as increased Globalization that would not be possible without humanity&#8217;s technological prowess, and I will gladly join this company on a potentially fantastic trajectory.

Molnar showed an early affinity for business growth, starting to sell jewelry throughout his time as a university student, as a side-hustle so to speak, eventually becoming the largest seller of jewelry on eBay in Australia. With ambitions to make a name for himself in the finance world,&nbsp; Molnar sought out to become an analyst within a private equity firm. However, as legend has it, he was encouraged to pursue the jewelry business with the full extent of his time  once his then boss found out how successful his endeavors were <a href="https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/why-fashion-is-key-to-afterpay-s-staggering-success-20210211-p571jp">[3]</a>. With this blessing in mind, Nick decided to launch an Australian web-presence for ice.com, a leading jeweler in America <a href="https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/why-fashion-is-key-to-afterpay-s-staggering-success-20210211-p571jp">[4]</a>, an endeavor that proved to be challenging given the fundamental disconnects that existed between conducting sales for luxury items in-person in comparison to through online mediums. According to Nick, the online front he had created was struggling with conversions, only able to turn one of every 100 website visitors into an actual paying customer <a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/nick-molnar-478a642a">[5]</a>. Leveraging his customer demographic&#8217;s distrust for credit cards, as well as the ever-growing trend of technologically-enabled instant gratification behavior (Uber, Food Delivery Services, Netflix etc.), Molnar and his then-neighbor Anthony Eisen (co-founder of Afterpay) stumbled upon the idea that is now Afterpay in 2014. The pair moved fast, with 2015 seeing the company enter into a joint venture agreement with Touchcorp, a digital payments system company, obtain their first customer by way of Fashion Group Princess Polly and raise $8M in private equity investment, which would be their only round of private funding. Their first business partner saw immediate success with the company&#8217;s BNPL payment methods, bumping their Average Order Value by A$44 and lifting their revenues as a whole by 15% <a href="https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/key-moments-in-the-afterpay-story-from-zero-to-39b-20210802-p58f6n">[6]</a>. It was evident that their business model worked and as such, the company decided to go public, listing on the ASX at $1 Per share. Growth efforts continued, eventually resulting in the company hitting 1M customers and over 7,200 merchants by 2017. Since then, the company has expanded into New Zealand, the UK, the US, Canada and currently has plans to expand further into Europe, Spain and Italy <a href="https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/key-moments-in-the-afterpay-story-from-zero-to-39b-20210802-p58f6n">[7]</a>. This tale, of which has many similarities to the origin story of Square, highlights a common theme that exists within successful entrepreneurial endeavors, i.e. founders creating a solution to a problem they&#8217;ve faced in your own life. Outlined within the Innovation Stack by James McKelvey, the idea for Square, which would inevitably become the company destined to acquire Afterpay, was spurred by a problem McKelvey faced as a small merchant himself. More specifically, when James was trying to sell his hand-made glass project to a customer he was unable to accept credit cards as a form of payment. Capitalizing upon the fact that existing payment systems did not cater towards merchants with small GMVs, McKelvey turned this $2000 lost sale into a $100B+ company by creating payment solutions that were cost-effective, transparent, elegantly designed and easy to use, all aimed at small merchants. Afterpay falls under the same umbrella, solving an issue that Molnar was having with poor sales and capitalizing upon the fact that existing payment methods did not cater towards the spending/financial habits of younger generations (main user cohort of BNPL) in an all-encompassing manner. With both Square and Afterpay connecting merchants and consumers, I couldn&#8217;t think of a better addition to the company&#8217;s roster, but more on that later.&nbsp;</p><p>For now, let&#8217;s take a look at some key trends and happenings that the company intends to benefit from as well as the main demographics they will be catering towards with their product offerings.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>3.0 Opportunity and Demographics</strong></p><p>Afterpay undoubtedly has an enormous opportunity in front of them, mainly as a result of the staggering activity that we have seen in the Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) space. This opportunity, in my opinion, has arisen as a result of the following phenomenon: the rise of e-commerce, an increasing disregard/acceptance of traditional credit card payment systems as well as an associated and proportional increase in trust that many are placing in new-age financial institutions.&nbsp;</p><p>Starting with the rise of e-commerce, there is no doubt that pandemic-induced tailwinds help to spur the adoption of this shopping medium globally. Despite that fact, these trends don&#8217;t appear to be going anywhere anytime soon. By 2026 Total Retail Commerce Sales are expected to reach a staggering $6.388T, with the total percentage of retail sales occurring through e-commerce mediums being exacerbated proportionally as a result, expected to reach 21.8%, respectively.

A report conducted by WorldPay, one of the largest payment technology companies in the world, paints a telling picture of where the payment method landscape may end up. More specifically, BNPL was estimated to be the payment method behind approximately 2% of all associated transactions in 2020, and is expected to reach approximately 4% by the end of 2023 <a href="https://worldpay.globalpaymentsreport.com/en/">[9]</a>. You may be wondering why exactly BNPL has seen such rapid growth, and why it is not anticipated to slow down anytime soon. First-off there has been an ever-increasing prevalence of individuals trusting intermediaries with their financial data, and thus leveraging non-legacy banking systems to cater towards their financial needs. This phenomenon and the change in the relationship between consumer and associated institution, i.e. an open banking systems, can be seen outlined by the image below:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af095b8-7215-41ec-8453-ae376ded8e59_862x459.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af095b8-7215-41ec-8453-ae376ded8e59_862x459.png" width="862" height="459" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3af095b8-7215-41ec-8453-ae376ded8e59_862x459.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:459,&quot;width&quot;:862,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af095b8-7215-41ec-8453-ae376ded8e59_862x459.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af095b8-7215-41ec-8453-ae376ded8e59_862x459.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af095b8-7215-41ec-8453-ae376ded8e59_862x459.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3af095b8-7215-41ec-8453-ae376ded8e59_862x459.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Diagram illustrating the change in traditional bank-consumer relationships <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/prediction-the-future-of-cx">[10]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>As such, the Fintech Companies and other institutions providing payment methods that would&#8217;ve otherwise not been possible decades prior have seen increases in user engagement activity. Secondly, a growing distrust of credit cards may be another spurring factor behind previous and future BNPL growth. With the average credit card debt in the United States coming in at approximately $6,270 <a href="https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-credit-card-debt">[11]</a>&nbsp; as well as an ever increasing knowledge of the potentially disastrous effects that compounding can have when it acts against you, many are seeking out alternative means of purchasing goods/services that they feel are more transparent. Not only a phenomenon in the United States, this assertion is corroborated further when looking at credit card behavior in Australia, the birthplace of the company and the geographic region that will likely continue to be a large part of Afterpay&#8217;s success.

With the company&#8217;s strong focus on partnering with trendy brands ranging from Revolve to Fenty and Asos, as well as their understanding of the disregard these individuals have for traditional credit systems, Afterpay appears to be poised to capitalize on both these spending and demographic trends, particularly of their young customers. The final factor that is worth discussing is the income mix of the constituents that frequent BNPL services. More specifically, the most common BNPL users in the United States are those with Incomes less than $25,000 (24% of their cohort) and those within the $25,000-$50,000 range (40% of their cohort), respectively <a href="https://www.cardify.ai/reports/buy-now-pay-later">[16]</a>. As such, Afterpay will need to cater towards the spending habits of these individuals. In order to maximize GMV generation the company will most likely need to ensure frequent and repeat spending with reasonably small Average Order Values (AOV). In summary, Afterpay is poised to capitalize on the aforementioned tailwinds above and will need to maintain a steady focus on expanding into new verticals (i.e. new products/services BNPL can be used for) and catering towards the above demographics in order to create as much LTV as possible for shareholders. </p><p>Now that we have a better understanding of what opportunities, trends and individuals Afterpay aims to capitalize upon and cater towards, let&#8217;s take a look at the company offers both consumers and merchants. </p><div><hr></div><p><strong>4.0 What Afterpay Offers Consumers and Merchants</strong></p><p>In order to understand Afterpay&#8217;s business we must first split their product and services offerings into two unique and distinct components, those directed at Consumers and others directed at Merchants. The company has a unique value proposition aimed at each of these parties, of which allows for the creation and maintenance of a thriving ecosystem containing both buyers and sellers.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Consumers&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p>Put simply, consumers are able to extract value from Afterpay by leveraging the following functionality: <em>convenient payment method, spending tracking and budgeting, </em>and <em>online marketplace</em>. Each of these components creates a sticky customer experience and brand recognition that stands out within the BNPL space, of which can be seen broken down in further detail below.</p><p><em>Convenient Payment Method</em></p><p>The first and arguably one of the most important pieces of the Afterpay Consumer story is how convenient paying with the platform is. More specifically, consumers can execute a payment with Afterpay either through the merchant&#8217;s platform as follows <a href="https://dayhype.com/pages/how-afterpay-works">[17]</a>:</p><ol><li><p>Add the product you wish to purchase to your cart</p></li><li><p>Select Afterpay as the payment method at checkout</p></li><li><p>Login/create your Afterpay account, of which is approved instantly</p></li><li><p>Complete Purchase.

More specifically, the manner in which the company provides consumers with access to credit is impressive to say the least. Traditional means of obtaining credit are usually littered with FICO scores, i.e. a rating system&nbsp; that has been used traditionally to gauge whether credit should be provided to an individual. The FICO system measures how much credit a consumer has, how much of said credit is being used and how often they&#8217;ve been able to pay what they owe on time. Therefore, associated application processes are usually tedious. It is therefore evident that Afterpay, as a credit-based payment method, reduces the friction associated with a transaction as a whole in quite a tangible manner. On a side note, Afterpay mitigates some of their credit risk concerns by limiting the amount of credit they issue a consumer on each purchase. More specifically, total credit provided to consumers is usually less than $3000. As an example, when I signed up for Afterpay for the sake of due diligence, I was allotted approximately $600 to be able to spend. The rate at which the total credit made available to me would then increase as time goes on, contingent on my ability to pay back past purchases. The transparency of repayment is a notable spurring factor to creating repeat customers. The four stage process occurs as follows: One instalment at the time of purchase and 3 installments spread across every two weeks of the 6 week term <a href="https://www.afterpay.com/en-AU/how-it-works">[19]</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Spending Tracking and Budgeting&nbsp;</em></p><p>Afterpay&#8217;s consumer-directed functionality is focused on maintaining a high degree of freedom and flexibility. More specifically, through the company&#8217;s website or app consumers can:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Check their spend limit</p></li><li><p>Reschedule their payments (Afterpay allows for customers to reschedule up to three payment dates per year, shifting them up to five days with each update)</p></li><li><p>Choose how much they pay (although the company has a typical four-instalment repayment process, customers can choose to pay off more or all of their outstanding purchase balance ahead of schedule)</p></li></ul><p>Afterpay&#8217;s platform also organizes all purchases under the payment schedule app. An example of this dashboard, from my makeshift Afterpay account, can be seen outlined below:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5243bcb0-01c9-4054-a42a-794998f3a34b_1310x303.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5243bcb0-01c9-4054-a42a-794998f3a34b_1310x303.png" width="1310" height="303" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5243bcb0-01c9-4054-a42a-794998f3a34b_1310x303.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:303,&quot;width&quot;:1310,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5243bcb0-01c9-4054-a42a-794998f3a34b_1310x303.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5243bcb0-01c9-4054-a42a-794998f3a34b_1310x303.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5243bcb0-01c9-4054-a42a-794998f3a34b_1310x303.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5243bcb0-01c9-4054-a42a-794998f3a34b_1310x303.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Example Afterpay Dashboard <a href="https://portal.afterpay.com/ca/payment-schedule?sort=dueDate&amp;direction=ascending&amp;page=1">[20]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Online Marketplace</em></p><p>Afterpay is also focused on providing a unique shopping experience to their consumers.

More specifically, companies that partner with the service get paid upfront, i.e. they don&#8217;t have to wait for the BNPL loan to get repaid before they receive what they are owed for each purchase. In addition, Afterpay takes on the transaction risk, i.e. the risks associated with chargebacks and fraud, aimed at helping merchants focus on essential business processes rather than the minute details. Lastly, merchants can leverage a series of reporting functionality such as receiving daily settlement reports, where the transactional data contained within can be used to verify orders etc.&nbsp;</p><p>Important is the fact that the integration with Afterpay is seamless. Getting the ball rolling is as simple as filling out a form on Afterpay&#8217;s website, as outlined below. Also of note is the fact that Afterpay supports a host of e-commerce and POS providers. The company also offers bespoke solutions for businesses that are equipped with their own developers, indicative of the fact that the company is focused on reducing friction of the integration

Unlike credit cards with their deceptive late fees and charges, Afterpay&#8217;s late fees are crystal clear, with customers being charged $10 if their payment is not processed on or before the due date, and a further $7 being charged subsequently for each week that the balance continues to go unpaid.

As previously outlined in discussions regarding how Afterpay makes money, Afterpay Revenue is primarily derived from payment processing fees, i.e. the difference between what consumers pay for an item and what the merchant receives from Afterpay. Afterpay also sees slight contributions to their Revenues from late fees, of which is recognized by the Other Revenues metric. Pay Now Revenue is essentially revenue the company generates from facilitating transactions from existing consumers to different forms service model providers. Put simply, this Revenue source can essentially be thought of as referral fees generated through Afterpay&#8217;s connections to different entities.

Pay Now revenue as a percentage of Total Revenue has been steadily declining over the last few years. This fact is further corroborated when looking at the fact that management stopped operating their European e-services business unit last year. Therefore, this phenomenon is likely to continue in the coming years as Afterpay continues to focus on their main business strengths. An important revenue-related metric that investors should continue to monitor is Late Fees as a percentage of Afterpay Revenue.

The growth in both Active Customers and Active Merchants is important, however, being that the company derives the majority of their Revenues from fees charged to merchants for payment processing, as well as the fact that having more Merchants available to take Afterpay as a payment method should increase customer experience as a result, continued merchant acquisition efforts will be imperative to LTV creation. If Afterpay were to be viewed like a traditional payment processing company, the value proposition for merchants becomes very clear. In order to make a clear comparison, I created my own metric, Payment Processing Take Rate. This was calculated by dividing the company&#8217;s Afterpay Revenue Less the effects of Late Fees by Total GMV. As such, this allows for the effect of Revenue only generated from Merchants to be examined with respect to GMV.

GMV is primarily attributable to North America and APAC (Australia). Secondly, the majority of the company&#8217;s Active Customers are from North America, followed by Australia, however there have been some noticeable growth in customers in the UK (Clearpay) over the last two Fiscal Years. Lastly, as expected given the fact that Afterpay has its roots down under, the majority of the company&#8217;s merchants are in Australia, followed by respectable growth in the US and UK. With these factors in mind, we can take a look at the competition that Afterpay will likely face, specifically from Klarna and Affirm, its two most noticeable peers, in my opinion, as measured by GMV, Active Customers and Merchants:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa384acae-abc3-45e3-bd03-94a1ee9a3a26_637x335.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa384acae-abc3-45e3-bd03-94a1ee9a3a26_637x335.png" width="637" height="335" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a384acae-abc3-45e3-bd03-94a1ee9a3a26_637x335.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:335,&quot;width&quot;:637,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:25104,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa384acae-abc3-45e3-bd03-94a1ee9a3a26_637x335.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa384acae-abc3-45e3-bd03-94a1ee9a3a26_637x335.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa384acae-abc3-45e3-bd03-94a1ee9a3a26_637x335.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa384acae-abc3-45e3-bd03-94a1ee9a3a26_637x335.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Starting off with Klarna, this powerhouse is likely to remain the biggest source of competition for Afterpay.

United Kingdom</figcaption></figure></div><p>With Affirm, although this company is leveraging a combination of retail hype and partnerships with some of the biggest merchants in the United States, Afterpay is likely to remain ahead in this regard. My reasoning for this is based upon the fact that Afterpay will be introduced into the Square/Cash App ecosystem in the near future, of which will undoubtedly bring more eyes onto the platform, particularly since Square has such a loyal consumer base in the US. In addition, although Affirm is leveraging connections and excitement to their advantage, Afterpay still managed to grow FY&#8217;21 GMV at a faster rate on a YoY basis (90% vs 79%), despite having almost 2x the GMV to begin with. When viewed alongside the key geographic distributions of Afterpay&#8217;s GMV, merchants and consumers, I believe that the best route for success is for Afterpay to maintain their competitive advantage in both the US and Australia. With the company&#8217;s best-in class brand recognition I do not anticipate that this will be a hard feat to accomplish:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9a9064c-4645-4103-9630-85a226112a8a_1080x414.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9a9064c-4645-4103-9630-85a226112a8a_1080x414.png" width="1080" height="414" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f9a9064c-4645-4103-9630-85a226112a8a_1080x414.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:414,&quot;width&quot;:1080,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9a9064c-4645-4103-9630-85a226112a8a_1080x414.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9a9064c-4645-4103-9630-85a226112a8a_1080x414.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9a9064c-4645-4103-9630-85a226112a8a_1080x414.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9a9064c-4645-4103-9630-85a226112a8a_1080x414.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Cardify Brand Recognition <a href="https://www.cardify.ai/reports/bnpl-trend-report">[28]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Lastly, it is important for shareholders to monitor the amount of credit losses the company incurs. This metric, reported by Afterpay as Gross Loss, highlights Afterpay&#8217;s ability to scale while not becoming fragile as an expense in the face of looming credit risk. The fact that the company was able to maintain steady Gross Loss as % of Total Revenue and GMV while expanding more heavily into the US and UK (less mature markets than Australia) is impressive to say the least. The improvement in these values evidently benefit from the current macroeconomic environment, i.e. low interest rates usually lead to less credit defaults all around, therefore it is worth watching this value alongside macroeconomic happenings in the future Fiscal Years to assess Afterpay&#8217;s overall health:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08db4e78-ab9a-44d0-8b19-73a3aafb49c0_481x288.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08db4e78-ab9a-44d0-8b19-73a3aafb49c0_481x288.png" width="481" height="288" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/08db4e78-ab9a-44d0-8b19-73a3aafb49c0_481x288.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:288,&quot;width&quot;:481,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08db4e78-ab9a-44d0-8b19-73a3aafb49c0_481x288.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08db4e78-ab9a-44d0-8b19-73a3aafb49c0_481x288.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08db4e78-ab9a-44d0-8b19-73a3aafb49c0_481x288.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08db4e78-ab9a-44d0-8b19-73a3aafb49c0_481x288.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Change in Gross Loss as a % of GMV</figcaption></figure></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa65dddb1-fc4c-4516-9463-8d28ce83e34b_481x288.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa65dddb1-fc4c-4516-9463-8d28ce83e34b_481x288.png" width="481" height="288" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a65dddb1-fc4c-4516-9463-8d28ce83e34b_481x288.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:288,&quot;width&quot;:481,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa65dddb1-fc4c-4516-9463-8d28ce83e34b_481x288.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa65dddb1-fc4c-4516-9463-8d28ce83e34b_481x288.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa65dddb1-fc4c-4516-9463-8d28ce83e34b_481x288.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa65dddb1-fc4c-4516-9463-8d28ce83e34b_481x288.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Change in Gross Loss as a % of Total Revenues</figcaption></figure></div><div><hr></div><p><strong>8.0 What Afterpay adds to Square</strong></p><p>When completing research on Square, I came across an interesting article, one that discusses the tale of Square Wallet, a failed venture in the company&#8217;s past that many are not aware of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-DGB-35030">[29]</a>.&nbsp;

This is where the idea of a closed loop payment system comes in. Loosely defined as a transaction that occurs between the buyer and the seller, with no other middle part involved, this system is a holy grail of sorts within the Fintech industry. Open-loop payment systems, of which most of us interact with on a frequent basis, operate in an opposite manner, facilitating the interaction between consumer and merchant, distributing small percentages of the total transaction by way of fees to different intermediaries.

The first is Cash App Pay, a new app feature that will allow for consumers to utilize their Cash App accounts to pay for goods/services at select Square Sellers. This process doesn't require the intermediary payment processing rails to speak (i.e. Mastercard, Visa) and thus is a closed-loop payment system of sorts. The second effort, of which has been the subject of this report, is Square&#8217;s metaphorical adoption of Afterpay. To me this represents an obvious way for Square to connect consumers and merchants together in a way that would not be possible before the acquisition, with the dynamics of a BNPL network resulting in spurious and increased interactions between each party. When combined with Cash App, one can ponder the directions that Square is likely to push the app towards alongside Afterpay. The most obvious in my opinion is the intertwinement of Afterpay with Cash App. More specifically, in order to strengthen the engagement with the Square ecosystem as a whole, I see no reason for the company not to allow for repayments of BNPL loans to occur using Cash App. With Cash App having over 40M monthly transacting users and Afterpay having close to 12M Active Consumers and 70,000+ Merchants to shop from, it is exciting to think about the growth increased adoption that will occur when Afterpay&#8217;s Network combines with Cash App&#8217;s ecosystem. These efforts, when combined, will allow for Afterpay to generate revenue from Afterpay-related Cash App usage, i.e. the repayment of a BNPL loan with Cash App and from transaction fees paid by merchants for each Afterpay transaction. Many have stated that Square may have overpaid for this acquisition, however, when I think about the organic growth that this partnership will cause, I see unfathomable value here.</p><p>The second reason that I think this acquisition will have tangible effects on Square&#8217;s growth is international expansion. When looking at International Revenue as a % of Total Net Revenue (for Square), this value has managed to remain under 5% over the last few quarters, as outlined below:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe61e1dc3-2b78-492b-b8fa-3b7cac01f8cf_480x288.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe61e1dc3-2b78-492b-b8fa-3b7cac01f8cf_480x288.png" width="480" height="288" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e61e1dc3-2b78-492b-b8fa-3b7cac01f8cf_480x288.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:288,&quot;width&quot;:480,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe61e1dc3-2b78-492b-b8fa-3b7cac01f8cf_480x288.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe61e1dc3-2b78-492b-b8fa-3b7cac01f8cf_480x288.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe61e1dc3-2b78-492b-b8fa-3b7cac01f8cf_480x288.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe61e1dc3-2b78-492b-b8fa-3b7cac01f8cf_480x288.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Change in Square&#8217;s International Revenue as a % of Total Net Revenue</figcaption></figure></div><p>When looking at Afterpay&#8217;s GMV on the other hand, the company derives approximately 90% of Total GMV, approximately 45% each, from the US and Australia, followed by approximately 10% from the UK. When the two ecosystems intersect it is likely to have a twofold effect. The first will be strengthening Square&#8217;s stronghold on the United States. We know from previous discussions that the company trumps both Klarna and Affirm in the US but it is also worth noting that Cash App overshadows its close competitor, Paypal&#8217;s Venmo, as corroborated by Google Search Interest below:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76e0072d-1650-460f-9f26-d68e81e688eb_1144x551.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76e0072d-1650-460f-9f26-d68e81e688eb_1144x551.png" width="1144" height="551" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/76e0072d-1650-460f-9f26-d68e81e688eb_1144x551.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:551,&quot;width&quot;:1144,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76e0072d-1650-460f-9f26-d68e81e688eb_1144x551.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76e0072d-1650-460f-9f26-d68e81e688eb_1144x551.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76e0072d-1650-460f-9f26-d68e81e688eb_1144x551.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76e0072d-1650-460f-9f26-d68e81e688eb_1144x551.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The combination of the two is likely to create an interesting payment-technology landscape in the US. Secondly, Afterpay&#8217;s incorporation with the Square ecosystem is likely to further the company&#8217;s international efforts, particularly in Australia (since Klarna largely overshadows the presence of Clearpay in the UK this acquisition may have marginal effects in that region). In summary I believe the Afterpay acquisition has a twofold effect on Square as a whole. First, they will be able to leverage the strong Network Effects of Afterpay to gorilla glue their two business segments together. Second, they will be able to expedite International Expansion while also increasing the distance between competitors, both within the BNPL space and beyond within the US. I am truly a fan of this decision to acquire Afterpay. </p><div><hr></div><p><strong>9.0 Conclusion</strong></p><p>In summary, Square is a behemoth of a business that has only been made stronger with the addition of Afterpay into its ecosystem. With a Seller-focused segment that has yet to experience serious competition, Cash App bolstering strong customer adoption and sticky associated use-cases (P2P money transfer, investing and spending) and Afterpay cementing Square as a bank of the future with its exposure to a fast-moving payment method that is taking the world by storm, it is quite easy to be a Square shareholder. So concludes the second part of my Square research. I hope you learned as much about each of its components reading these two pieces as I did writing them. Thank you for reading. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ffaf222-8cf1-4f12-be5d-2c621b9931e3_1555x1284.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ffaf222-8cf1-4f12-be5d-2c621b9931e3_1555x1284.jpeg" width="1456" height="1202" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7ffaf222-8cf1-4f12-be5d-2c621b9931e3_1555x1284.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1202,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;I&amp;#39;m a too late for the jack dorsey memes?: memes&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="I&amp;#39;m a too late for the jack dorsey memes?: memes" title="I&amp;#39;m a too late for the jack dorsey memes?: memes" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ffaf222-8cf1-4f12-be5d-2c621b9931e3_1555x1284.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ffaf222-8cf1-4f12-be5d-2c621b9931e3_1555x1284.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ffaf222-8cf1-4f12-be5d-2c621b9931e3_1555x1284.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ffaf222-8cf1-4f12-be5d-2c621b9931e3_1555x1284.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Meme of the Day</figcaption></figure></div><p>If you enjoyed this research piece, please give it a like, comment below and share!</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://mtcapital.substack.com/p/square-inc-sq?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyMzI2NTg2MCwicG9zdF9pZCI6NDE5NjU1NDUsImlhdCI6MTYzMzU2MTgwMCwiaXNzIjoicHViLTM0NzkwNyIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.FPrGyQ-CH4_WGLv77iniCD6iFkcSlqQ6yj2IRCuq3sM&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://mtcapital.substack.com/p/square-inc-sq?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyMzI2NTg2MCwicG9zdF9pZCI6NDE5NjU1NDUsImlhdCI6MTYzMzU2MTgwMCwiaXNzIjoicHViLTM0NzkwNyIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.FPrGyQ-CH4_WGLv77iniCD6iFkcSlqQ6yj2IRCuq3sM"><span>Share</span></a></p><p>If you want to see more frequent investing-related content, give me a follow on twitter @MT_Capital1.

A report conducted by Insider Intelligence highlights the sheer breadth of global e-commerce, with the 2021 global retail e-commerce sales expected to come in at approximately $4.9T, as outlined below:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e313b99-ca23-415a-9dfc-f794eaec10d4_470x460.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e313b99-ca23-415a-9dfc-f794eaec10d4_470x460.png" width="470" height="460" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1e313b99-ca23-415a-9dfc-f794eaec10d4_470x460.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:460,&quot;width&quot;:470,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e313b99-ca23-415a-9dfc-f794eaec10d4_470x460.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e313b99-ca23-415a-9dfc-f794eaec10d4_470x460.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e313b99-ca23-415a-9dfc-f794eaec10d4_470x460.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e313b99-ca23-415a-9dfc-f794eaec10d4_470x460.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">E-Commerce Opportunity <a href="https://www.shopify.ca/enterprise/global-ecommerce-statistics#:~:text=The%20global%20ecommerce%20market%20is%20expected%20to%20total%20%244.89%20trillion%20in%202021.&amp;text=Today%2C%20that%20number%20is%20expected,increase%20in%20just%20five%20years">[2]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Despite this value&#8217;s enormity, when looked at from the perspective of a % of total retail sales, e-commerce is still only anticipated to account for 20% of all retail sales transactions. Despite having accelerated at a breakneck pace from 2019 to 2020, these values, to me, are illustrative of a continued opportunity for growth. With almost every business starting or maintaining an e-commerce presence, combined with some key demographic happenings and behaviours, continued growth appears to be inevitable. In 2021 alone it was estimated that cohorts within younger generations, particularly Gen Z and Millennials, conduct almost 65% of their total shopping online, with 34% of their total purchases being conducted through mobile-app mediums. In short, the future looks bright for products that facilitate and encourage e-commerce purchases.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone who has followed the Fintech industry as of late understands the activity we have seen in the Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) space. BNPL can be defined, loosely, as POS instalment loans that allow customers to purchase products and then pay for them at a later date. Customers typically make an upfront payment towards the item and then pay for the rest of the balance in an equal number of predetermined instalments <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/buy-now-pay-later-5182291">[3]</a>. This payment method is expanding rapidly, a happening which intersects perfectly with the rapid rise of e-commerce. Of the total global e-commerce transactions, 2.1% were estimated to be attributable to BNPL sources, with this value expected to reach 4% by 2024 <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/21/how-buy-now-pay-later-became-a-100-billion-industry.html#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20report%20from,by%202024%2C%20according%20to%20Worldpay">[4]</a>.&nbsp; When considering the sheer magnitude of the GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume) that would result from 2-4% of global e-commerce transactions occurring via BNPL mediums, this is an exciting prospect.</p><p>Affirm also aims to capitalize on the lack of transparency within the financial services and payment industry. This effort, to me, aligns very well with some of the core lessons that were prevalent within the Innovation Stack by James McKelvey. The book, though largely a tale centered around the rise of Square Inc., one of the largest Fintech companies in the world, told a similar tale of the lack of transparency within the aforementioned industries. More specifically, a large part of Square&#8217;s success can be attributed to their product offerings catering to underserved individuals, those of which were largely overlooked by some of the largest corporations in the world. By building products that had no hidden fees, pleasant user experiences and were not associated with strict terms, conditions or lock-in periods/contracts, Square excelled. Moving back to Affirm, the company aims to capitalize on similar issues and accelerate their business accordingly.&nbsp; Differing is the fact that the company is trying to repair the issues that consumers have with standard debit and credit cards. To put things into perspective, in the latter half of 2020 it was estimated that consumers had paid $104B in late charges for the Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) a value that had increased 11% from 2018 and almost 29% from 2013 <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/19/consumers-paying-104-billion-in-credit-card-interest-and-fees.html">[5]</a>.&nbsp; In addition, it was estimated that Americans owe nearly $806B in credit card debt across 500M unique credit cards <a href="http://valuepenguin.com/average-credit-card-debt#:~:text=Overall%2C%20Americans%20owe%20%24807%20billion%20across%20almost%20506%20million%20card%20accounts">[6]</a>. With the nature of credit cards in general, and how there is almost an incentivization of sorts to let debt compound against you by way of only making minimum payments, there exists an evident need for payment methods that don&#8217;t generate revenue at the expense of the individual&#8217;s financial wellbeing.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27fa6d95-024a-465a-bbaa-1f92875fb6b2_1200x872.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27fa6d95-024a-465a-bbaa-1f92875fb6b2_1200x872.png" width="466" height="338.62666666666667" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/27fa6d95-024a-465a-bbaa-1f92875fb6b2_1200x872.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:872,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:466,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27fa6d95-024a-465a-bbaa-1f92875fb6b2_1200x872.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27fa6d95-024a-465a-bbaa-1f92875fb6b2_1200x872.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27fa6d95-024a-465a-bbaa-1f92875fb6b2_1200x872.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27fa6d95-024a-465a-bbaa-1f92875fb6b2_1200x872.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Credit Card Debt Transaction <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/credit-cards/debt-snowball-vs-debt-avalanche-the-best-way-to-pay-off-credit-card-debt/">[7]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>A telling survey paints a potential picture for the direction the Financial Services Industry may be heading. More specifically, a 2020 Fintech study performed by PWC showcased the increasing rate at which Americans are trusting technology companies with their financial data, as well as the fact that individuals are more likely than ever to purchase financial products from said technology companies instead of legacy financial institutions <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/financial-services/assets/pdf/technology2020-and-beyond.pdf">[8]</a>. Lastly, the merchant is often left out of the payment solution equation. With the cost of customer acquisitions increasing on all ends, and retention being a nightmare of sorts that merchants commonly try to solve with promotions, aggressive sales, and expensive digital marketing campaigns, there is an untapped avenue for solutions that help merchants direct an influx of new customers their way. As such, tech companies that are able to provide sustainable, scalable and fair financial solutions to underserved consumers and merchants may be at the forefront of an enormous revolution in the payments space.

Despite, to many, seeming only like a company that facilitates alternative payment methods or loans, Affirm labels themselves first and foremost technology company. As a technology company, Affirm has engineered a solution that sets themselves apart from traditional credit underwriting models, allowing them to support an ever growing GMV, originating loans at a breakneck pace while also ensuring they are not becoming fragile in exposure to ever-looming credit default risk. All of this functionality is achieved through their inherent risk model. More specifically, this model, of which relies on a sea of data points, operates at the transaction level rather than relying on standard and outdated credit scores. As such, the company is able to offer attractive financing rates to customers that would have otherwise been turned away by legacy lending systems, while also decreasing the prevalence of delinquencies. In summary, Affirm&#8217;s risk model facilitates more loans all while negating risk in the process. And the best part is, the more data points the company receives the better this model will behave, theoretically.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Merchants&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p>Despite evidently catering towards their customer base well,  Affirm&#8217;s platform offers a series of benefits to merchants as well as a seamless onboarding process, of which can be seen outlined below:</p><ul><li><p><em>Choose a Customized Solution: </em>Merchants have the option to choose which BNPL payment option works best for their business. More specifically merchants can choose whether consumers can purchase products with either 0% APR or payment plans with fixed interest installments each month.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><em>Support a variety of Process Mediums: </em>Whether a merchant would like to conduct business via e-commerce, in-store or through tele-sales mediums, Affirm supports these business decisions. Affirm allows for the easy integration within an e-commerce site, encourages signage/displays to be placed in brick and mortar environments that catch the eye of customers and allows for consumers to be served over the phone without the need for the handling of confidential data, respectively.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><em>Mitigate Risk: </em>Affirm helps reduce the risks associated with conducting business. More specifically, the company helps reduce the prevalence of chargebacks and frauds and also ensures that merchants receive payments within 1-3 days of conducting purchases. In other words, despite the merchant offering customers BNPL options, Affirm takes on the risks associated with those transactions, ensuring merchants get paid no matter what.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Once merchants have been integrated with the Affirm ecosystem, they&#8217;re offered a series of technological capabilities that ensure stickiness is maintained to the umpteenth degree.

More specifically, Affirm earns interest income on the loans they direct at their customers, of which are originated by their bank partners, Cross River Bank and Celtic Bank, FDIC-insured banks located in the state of New Jersey and Utah, respectively <a href="https://investors.affirm.com/static-files/b85853cf-b293-46f8-a6e9-e63c0287e6f1">[17]</a>.&nbsp; In essence, the company purchases the loan from their originator banks, paying a fee that is equal to the principal interest of the loan, a fee for each loan purchase and any accrued interest, i.e. the amount of loan interest that has already occurred since inception but that has not been paid back to the borrower. In addition, the originating banks also receive a small performance fee from Affirm when the loan has been fully repaid by the customer. Therefore, put simply, Affirm earns money from the interest generated on these loans, less the accrued expenses, a fee for the loan purchase and the performance fee due upon loan payback. Also worth noting is the fact that Affirm is capable of originating their own loans using associated licenses in both Canada and the United States. This process, although it avoids the aforementioned costs, has only accounted for a small portion of total loans issued over the last few years and is likely to stay that way in the near future.&nbsp;</p><p>Affirm also earns money from consumers through the Virtual Cards segment of their business. More specifically, the company keeps a portion of the interchange fee that occurs whenever a customer utilizes one of these cards in a transaction. In order to fully understand the extent of the company&#8217;s moving pieces, how Affirm makes money from Virtual Cards should prove sufficient. Within a Virtual Card transaction, Affirm will underwrite a loan, set the terms (i.e. payback period, APR % etc.). The company will then obtain revenue from a portion of the interchange fee that occurs as a result of the transaction. Affirm will then leverage their connection to an origination bank in order to send a loan to the consumer, which results in Affirm having to purchase said loan from the bank as well as pay the institution an origination fee. The merchant will receive the sum from the bank in the amount of the total purchase value less the fee that Affirm charges merchants per transaction. In addition, Affirm will then collect any interest from the loan depending on what the APR terms are.</p><p><em><strong>Merchants</strong></em></p><p>Affirm earns Revenue in this segment by charging merchants for every transaction that their network, and by association their product/services, helps facilitate. The company doesn&#8217;t mention what these fees work out to be in terms as a % of the total transaction value, however, in my opinion, an educated guess would land somewhere in the 2-4% range.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>5.0 Financial Analysis - Q4 FY&#8217;21 Earnings</strong></p><p>The highlights of Affirm&#8217;s Q4 FY&#8217;21 earnings will be analyzed from this point onwards.

With this metric improving on a QoQ basis over the last four quarters as well as the 125% increase YoY, Affirm&#8217;s business is evidently accelerating, as outlined below:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb423b124-0213-4089-947f-21343ff7f84a_481x289.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb423b124-0213-4089-947f-21343ff7f84a_481x289.png" width="481" height="289" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b423b124-0213-4089-947f-21343ff7f84a_481x289.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:289,&quot;width&quot;:481,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb423b124-0213-4089-947f-21343ff7f84a_481x289.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb423b124-0213-4089-947f-21343ff7f84a_481x289.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb423b124-0213-4089-947f-21343ff7f84a_481x289.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb423b124-0213-4089-947f-21343ff7f84a_481x289.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Change in GMV</figcaption></figure></div><p>The growth in the company&#8217;s consumer base can also be honed in on by way of the total number of Active Consumers (consumer with at least one transaction on the platform in the TTM).&nbsp; The change in this value over the last few quarters can be seen below:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7254245d-b81a-4b51-b63a-6b5a2d15bd9a_481x289.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7254245d-b81a-4b51-b63a-6b5a2d15bd9a_481x289.png" width="481" height="289" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7254245d-b81a-4b51-b63a-6b5a2d15bd9a_481x289.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:289,&quot;width&quot;:481,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7254245d-b81a-4b51-b63a-6b5a2d15bd9a_481x289.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7254245d-b81a-4b51-b63a-6b5a2d15bd9a_481x289.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7254245d-b81a-4b51-b63a-6b5a2d15bd9a_481x289.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7254245d-b81a-4b51-b63a-6b5a2d15bd9a_481x289.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Change in Active Consumers</figcaption></figure></div><p>Increasing 97% on a YoY basis, Affirm is evidently bolstering strong consumer engagement.

Returnly treats returns as a transaction of sorts, allowing these occurrences to be processed instantly, providing consumers with quick access to merchant credit in the case where they were not satisfied with the original purchase.&nbsp; This acquisition not only brought new technological capabilities into the Affirm ecosystem, but brought new consumers and merchants with it, being that Returnly, as of May, serves over 1,800 merchants and has been used by 8M shoppers <a href="https://www.affirm.com/press/releases/affirm-completes-acquisition-of-returnly">[20]</a>. In December of 2020, Affirm announced their intent to acquire PayBright, one of Canada&#8217;s premier BNPL companies. This acquisition not only represents a great opportunity for Affirm to extend its reach outside of the US but also gives Affirm access to some of the biggest merchants in the world. More specifically, customers have access, through Paybright, to BNPL transactions at Apple, Wayfair, Sephora and more. Although these acquisitions, as of right now have only accounted for an additional 1.85% in GMV as of the end of FY&#8217;21, these acquisitions in my eyes are important for two reasons. Firstly, via Returnly, the company increases the stickiness of their ecosystems and reduces the friction associated with making purchases on their platform. There is nothing worse than returning products in the traditional sense of the deed, therefore, customers knowing that purchasing products has now been made risk-free and painless, should help GMV and Total Network Revenue going forwards. Secondly, PayBright is most exciting to me because of their connection to Apple. This tech mega-company is intertwined with almost all of our lives (as I type on this my mac) and the incorporation of BNPL with Apple as a merchant creates an interesting value proposition. With this partnership existing in Canada, one can only imagine the GMV growth that would occur if this partnership were to extend into the US as well. Smart acquisitions like this make a lot of sense for Affirm and it highlights the fact the company is willing to acquire in order to climb higher up the totem pole, so to speak.&nbsp;</p><p>Moving on to some internal developments, the company is evidently working on rolling out products that increase the activity in their ecosystem and stickiness overall. Starting of with the Affirm debit+ card. Customers will be able to use the physical debit card to pay online or in stores.  Affirm will them notify the consumer after the transaction has been completed if they are eligible to have said purchase split up and paid back over time. This card operates with a Consumer&#8217;s existing checking account, and reduces friction as a result of customers not needing to alter their existing bank relationships. This poses an interesting value proposition to consumers as it has no fees to open or maintain, can split bigger purchases into smaller ones, and can be used anywhere (not just affirm approved merchants), thus penetrating its way into consumer&#8217;s everyday in-store spending habits. For merchants, this offers the opportunity to tailor-fit deals and promotions to customers based upon associated purchasing data.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F133ce4de-365b-41c4-a963-6e2e4be1bf9c_1280x960.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F133ce4de-365b-41c4-a963-6e2e4be1bf9c_1280x960.png" width="480" height="360" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/133ce4de-365b-41c4-a963-6e2e4be1bf9c_1280x960.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:480,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F133ce4de-365b-41c4-a963-6e2e4be1bf9c_1280x960.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F133ce4de-365b-41c4-a963-6e2e4be1bf9c_1280x960.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F133ce4de-365b-41c4-a963-6e2e4be1bf9c_1280x960.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F133ce4de-365b-41c4-a963-6e2e4be1bf9c_1280x960.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Affrim Debit+ <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/affirms-super-app-ambitions-win-praise-as-company-plots-debit-crypto-moves-11632949669">[21]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Moving over to crypto, customers will soon have the ability to purchase different digital currencies utilizing the Affirm app.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8bb26189-4e8c-4142-8cee-3138c66c834a_907x511.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8bb26189-4e8c-4142-8cee-3138c66c834a_907x511.png" width="907" height="511" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8bb26189-4e8c-4142-8cee-3138c66c834a_907x511.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:511,&quot;width&quot;:907,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8bb26189-4e8c-4142-8cee-3138c66c834a_907x511.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8bb26189-4e8c-4142-8cee-3138c66c834a_907x511.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8bb26189-4e8c-4142-8cee-3138c66c834a_907x511.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8bb26189-4e8c-4142-8cee-3138c66c834a_907x511.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Affirm Crypto <a href="https://investors.affirm.com/static-files/097f3211-8ea5-4a6d-9b86-6dfa969bbe8a">[22]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>These new product/feature roll-outs most definitely create the feeling that the company is working on building a &#8220;Super App&#8221;.

href="https://www.affirm.com/press/releases/affirm-to-power-shopify-shop-pay-installments">[25]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Initiated in July of 2020, the Shopify x Affirm partnership allowed for the e-commerce giant&#8217;s merchants to offer BNPL payment options to their consumers, if they desired. Of Affirm&#8217;s Active Merchant Base, thousands are attributable to Shopify&#8217;s merchants. Not only has this already increased Total Network Revenue and GMV, but when combined with the eventual Affirm Debit+, the company will have made some notable progress on spurring shopping behavior associated with higher frequency and lower AOVs in comparison to the majority of purchases made within their ecosystem today.&nbsp;</p><p>With respect to Amazon, Affirm announced that they had entered into a partnership with the Giant in order to provide customers access to BNPL payment options for orders of more than $50. This partnership, though in its initial stages and only being made available to select customers at the moment, will be an undeniable source of growth for the company. By focusing on higher ticket purchases, Affirm will be able to leverage Amazon&#8217;s millions of customers in conjunction with reasonably high AOV to generate large magnitudes of value.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, although Affirm had already been partners with Walmart since 2019, there were a series of headways that have been made with respect to the magnitude of this arrangement. More specifically, in the latter half of September, Walmart announced that they had done away with their layaway program, replacing it with a BNPL payment option provided by Affirm <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-layaway-canceled-affirm-finance-buy-now-pay-later-2021-9">[26]</a>. The activity that Affirm will see in their ecosystem as a results of these two partnership is sure to generate LTV and a nice bump in their numbers. With Amazon and Walmart possessing a large share of total consumer retail spending by quarter, as well as the fact that BNPL drives higher instances of repeat buying in comparison to spending with a traditional credit card, it is easy to see why so many are excited about Affirm&#8217;s growth trajectory.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a16becb-3ab3-4005-b379-19b1175e176d_624x270.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a16becb-3ab3-4005-b379-19b1175e176d_624x270.png" width="624" height="270" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4a16becb-3ab3-4005-b379-19b1175e176d_624x270.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:270,&quot;width&quot;:624,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a16becb-3ab3-4005-b379-19b1175e176d_624x270.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a16becb-3ab3-4005-b379-19b1175e176d_624x270.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a16becb-3ab3-4005-b379-19b1175e176d_624x270.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a16becb-3ab3-4005-b379-19b1175e176d_624x270.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Change in Consumer Retail Spending <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/buy-now-pay-later/2021/with-walmart-and-amazon-now-on-board-with-affirm-bnpl-gains-critical-mass-to-take-on-big-credit/">[27]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Of additional note, Affirm announced yesterday that their BNPL services will be offered by Target to consumers in time for this holiday season.

Although the company is aiming to address this risk with all of their growth initiatives, shareholders should continue to monitor some key metrics.

With the tremendous growth in the GMV of these ecosystems, it is worth worrying whether or not these ecosystems will fold in the face of fragility, of which occurs as a result of an an inflationary environment, i.e. an environment where credit defaults tend to rise.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, it is worth noting the concentration risk in Affirm&#8217;s merchant base, and thus by association their Total Net Revenue. More specifically, at the end of FY&#8217;21 20% of the company&#8217;s revenue was attributable to Peloton and 25% of its Total Net Revenue was attributable to its Top 10 merchants <a href="https://www.creditkarma.com/about/commentary/buy-now-pay-later-surges-throughout-pandemic-consumers-credit-takes-a-hit">[34]</a>. Although the company has been mitigating the prevalence of this risk through new partnerships, the company is fragile in relation to consumer attitudes towards these merchants, and will face deteriorating financials if its merchants were incur decreased activities. Something to keep in mind at the very least.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>9.0 Conclusion </strong></p><p>Affirm&#8217;s efforts to build a Super App are noteworthy, to put it lightly. When combined with their relationships with top e-commerce retailers, sustained growth and great management, I can see why so many people are long this company. On the other side of the coin, there are risks, mainly with competition and a possible contraction that may occur in both tech multiples and BNPL activity in general. I am neither long nor short (mainly because of my allegiance with Square and Afterpay) however Affirm is a company, in my opinion that is definitely worth the attention. So concludes my research, I hope you learned as much as I did writing it. Thank you for reading. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6d4cd0b-77f1-4611-85a7-44d8e1085c59_764x627.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6d4cd0b-77f1-4611-85a7-44d8e1085c59_764x627.jpeg" width="606" height="497.3324607329843" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e6d4cd0b-77f1-4611-85a7-44d8e1085c59_764x627.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:627,&quot;width&quot;:764,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:606,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Blaine on Twitter: &amp;quot;$AFRM and $SQ through $AFTPY merger.

The company designs and sells various hardware products that include but are not limited to the Magstripe Reader, a device that allows for payments to occur with magnetic stripe cards; Square Stand, a device that allows for iPads to be effortlessly converted into a POS solution; and Square terminal, a device that replaces all the functionality of traditional keypad terminals, to name a few. The company also offers software and services ranging from Square Appointments, Square for Retail, Square Online and Square Online Checkout, etc. Of additional note is the fact that the company owns and operates Cash App, a mobile payment service that facilitates P2P (peer-to-peer) transactions, stock and crypto trading, the purchase of goods and services and much more. </p><p>Now that we know a bit more about what Square does and what they offer their customers, let&#8217;s take a look at the opportunity the company is facing and how they hope to capitalize on it going forwards, both in the coming quarters and years.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>2.0 Opportunity&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Square&#8217;s success, as of right now, has been directly reliant on the operation of two unique ecosystems, one surrounding Sellers, and the other surrounding Individuals (the users of Cash App to be more specific).&nbsp; Even with the recent acquisition of Afterpay, in my opinion, these will remain the company&#8217;s two primary focuses, being that BNPL efforts, in my eyes, represent an excellent opportunity for Square to grow Cash App and its associated user base in an expedient and organic manner.</p><p>Starting with the <em><strong>Seller Ecosystem Opportunity</strong></em>, Square estimates that the total opportunity in this segment is approximately $85B. This estimate, of which is directly reliant on estimated 20M businesses and $6T in Gross Receipts (business sales that form a basis for taxation), can be split into four distinct and unique sub-categories, of which can be seen outlined below <a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/311240100/files/doc_presentations/2021/03/Square-Investor-Presentation%E2%80%94December-2020.pdf">[2]</a>:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5fbee88-52b9-4a90-9bab-ca5439d41c9a_1085x606.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5fbee88-52b9-4a90-9bab-ca5439d41c9a_1085x606.png" width="1085" height="606" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c5fbee88-52b9-4a90-9bab-ca5439d41c9a_1085x606.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:606,&quot;width&quot;:1085,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5fbee88-52b9-4a90-9bab-ca5439d41c9a_1085x606.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5fbee88-52b9-4a90-9bab-ca5439d41c9a_1085x606.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5fbee88-52b9-4a90-9bab-ca5439d41c9a_1085x606.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5fbee88-52b9-4a90-9bab-ca5439d41c9a_1085x606.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Seller Ecosystem Market Opportunity, by Segment</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Transaction Profit</em>: This value was determined based upon the previously outlined value of $6T in Gross Receipts, multiplying by 0.65 (assuming that 65% of all of these payments were made with credit cards) and then multiplying that value by 0.01 (assuming a 1% transaction margin with respect to total Gross Payment Volume (GPV)).</p><p><em>Software</em>: This value was estimated by selecting targetable businesses reporting less than $100M in Annual Gross Receipts, within applicable industries, and multiplying this value by Square&#8217;s annualized software revenue per existing seller by product (three months ending January 2020).</p><p><em>Square Capital:</em> This value was determined by multiplying the total number of small business loans outstanding as of 2019 by the standard revenue rate on these loans of approximately 4-6%.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Financial Services:</em> This value exists as the combination of Transfer and Square Card opportunities. The Transfer subcomponent was determined by multiplying the Instant Transfer Volume per seller, estimated in 2H '19,&nbsp; by the 1.5% pricing on volume that Square uses for businesses with less than $250k in Gross Receipts. The Square Card Opportunity was determined by multiplying a multi-faceted estimate for average spend of targetable businesses, multiplied by the number of businesses with less than $20M in Gross Receipts, multiplied by estimated Mastercard Interchange Rates (fee that merchant is required to pay for every transaction).</p><p>Square aims to turn this total US Revenue Opportunity of $85B into a $100B counterpart by focusing on medium and long-term strategies. The former includes expansion into international markets as well as the creation/roll-out of new product use-cases, whereas the latter is heavily contingent on an up-market expansion, i.e. the targeting of mid-market and large US Sellers that offer trillions of untapped potential.</p><p> The second opportunity that Square must focus on is the <em><strong>Cash App Ecosystem</strong></em>. With $9T in volume the company hopes to address, the three-fold Cash-App opportunity can be seen outlined below:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ee20cd8-e7a1-41d1-b6b3-6cd635b0e78f_1085x606.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ee20cd8-e7a1-41d1-b6b3-6cd635b0e78f_1085x606.png" width="1085" height="606" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3ee20cd8-e7a1-41d1-b6b3-6cd635b0e78f_1085x606.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:606,&quot;width&quot;:1085,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ee20cd8-e7a1-41d1-b6b3-6cd635b0e78f_1085x606.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ee20cd8-e7a1-41d1-b6b3-6cd635b0e78f_1085x606.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ee20cd8-e7a1-41d1-b6b3-6cd635b0e78f_1085x606.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ee20cd8-e7a1-41d1-b6b3-6cd635b0e78f_1085x606.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Cash App Opportunity, by Segment</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Sending:</em> This opportunity is the sum of P2P and micro-merchant volume estimates.

Before we delve into each product, it is of paramount importance to understand how Square behaves within transactions occurring within their ecosystem. More specifically, Square acts as a merchant of record, a term commonly used in the payments industry to describe the party in the sales transaction whom the cardholder believes they are making a purchase from, and the party in which said cardholder is liable for payment <a href="https://www.venable.com/insights/publications/2019/05/will-the-real-merchant-of-record-please-stand-up#:~:text=Merchant%20Status,to%20describe%20their%20payment%20services.&amp;text=The%20merchant%20in%20a%20sales,cardholder%20is%20liable%20for%20payment">[8]</a>.&nbsp; This role allows for more efficient onboarding of sellers, the provision of transaction data analytics and other useful features. Square has also partnered with transaction processing services, card networks and issuing banks in order to provide sellers with the most expedient and reasonable terms possible. Associated Financial Services can be seen below:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Square Card: The money that a business makes and that goes into a seller&#8217;s checking account can be spent directly using the Square Prepaid Debit Card.</p></li><li><p>Instant Transfer: Transfers of up to $10,000 can be initiated and executed from the Square App or Dashboard.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Managed Payments: In exchange for a fee, Sellers can receive payments from customer&#8217;s cards via swipe, tap or through online mediums, as examples.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Risk Manager: Square provides customers with access to algorithms that are designed to analyze, spot and block payment fraud and secure business processes as a result.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Of additional note is the Financial Services that are provided through Square Capital. More specifically, Square Capital provides small business loans to interested parties, of which are sped up and made more pleasant in comparison to traditional loans through the use of their risk management processes, of which helps to facilitate both loan collections and the underwriting itself.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddcf4c68-3cf5-4b6c-8692-2308abccfe97_1200x630.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddcf4c68-3cf5-4b6c-8692-2308abccfe97_1200x630.png" width="1200" height="630" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ddcf4c68-3cf5-4b6c-8692-2308abccfe97_1200x630.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:630,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddcf4c68-3cf5-4b6c-8692-2308abccfe97_1200x630.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddcf4c68-3cf5-4b6c-8692-2308abccfe97_1200x630.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddcf4c68-3cf5-4b6c-8692-2308abccfe97_1200x630.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddcf4c68-3cf5-4b6c-8692-2308abccfe97_1200x630.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Square Capital Homepage <a href="https://www.cardfellow.com/blog/square-capital-upserve/">[9]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>In order to make this process even more efficient, in March of this year, Square announced that their industrial bank, Square Financial Services had completed its charter approval process and was FDIC approved to begin operations.

Regardless, this again offers another opportunity for customers to remain fully engaged within the full realm of financial capabilities contained within the Cash App ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that we have a better understanding of the full realm of products and services offers their customers, both within the Seller and Cash App ecosystems respectively, let&#8217;s take a look at how exactly Square makes money from it.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>4.0 How Square Makes $$$</strong></p><p><em><strong>Seller Ecosystem&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p>Square&#8217;s Seller Revenue can be split into three constituents: Transactions, Services and Subscriptions as well as Hardware. The main manner in which the company makes money from each of these categories can be seen outlined below.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Transactions</em></p><p>Revenue extracted from Transactions is primarily attributable to Square&#8217;s POS and Online software. For Square&#8217;s POS-related Software, of which contains Square POS, Retail, Restaurant and Appointment specifically, the company charges sellers a 2.65% fee per in person transaction (in relation to total purchase value) for all major credit cards and a 10 cent fee for every INTERAC chip and pin or tap use <a href="https://squareup.com/ca/en/point-of-sale">[18]</a>.&nbsp; Square&#8217;s Online-related Software (Square Online, Square Online Checkout, Square Invoices) makes money slightly differently, charging sellers a 2.9% + 10 cent fee per transaction, as previously outlined.&nbsp; Square Virtual Terminal turns seller&#8217;s computers into fully functional payment terminals capable of accepting both credit and debit cards, with the associated fee structure catering towards both remote in-person use-cases as such. For remote situations (i.e. typed-in transactions) sellers are charged 3.4% + 15 cents per transaction) whereas in-person processing has an identical fee structure to the traditional POS software <a href="https://squareup.com/ca/en/payments/virtual-terminal">[19]</a>.&nbsp; It should be noted that Square gives sellers a custom-pricing option if and only if their Revenues exceed $250K. Additionally, all transaction-related services utilized within custom-built applications via APIs / SDKs will have identical cost-structures to those of the counterparts outlined above.</p><p><em>Services and Subscriptions&nbsp;</em></p><p>Starting off with Square POS Software, these products generate Subscription revenue in addition to their transaction fee revenue counterpart. The associated pricing of each of these products is outlined below:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Square Retail: $60/location.</p></li><li><p>Square Restaurant: Free for one location, $60/month per device per location and $40/month for each additional POS device added.</p></li><li><p>Square Appointment: Free for 1 user, $50/month for 2-5 users, $90/month for 6-11 users.</p></li></ul><p>Although Square&#8217;s Online Dashboard is offered to sellers for free, Square Team Management contained within requires a subscription in order to be used to the extent of its capabilities (i.e. to access advanced data analytics etc.). More specifically, the plus tier of Square Team Management costs $35/month/location <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/point-of-sale/team-management">[20]</a>. </p><p>The products contained underneath the Financial Services umbrella, of which charge sellers for their use can be seen outlined and described below.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Square Instant Transfer: transfers of up to $10,000 cost 1.5% for each transfer.</p></li><li><p>Square Risk Manager: 6 cents per online transaction monitored.</p></li><li><p>Square Capital: Loans extended to qualified sellers are paid back by Square taking a fixed percentage of each sale the business makes <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001512673/c7b05bfa-5bb8-43b7-9580-9de362ef1e83.pdf">[21]</a>.</p></li></ul><p><em>Hardware&nbsp;</em></p><p>Square charges sellers a fixed fee for the purchase of each hardware device.

Cash App charges customers a small fee when they complete a bitcoin trade and being that there is usually a price difference between bitcoin exchanges are quoting and what individuals pay for bitcoin, the company generates additional revenue on the exchange it facilitates <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/company-insights/090916/how-square-cash-works-and-makes-money-sq.asp">[25]</a>.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>5.0 Financial Analysis - Q2&#8217;21 Earnings</strong></p><p>Square reported their Q2&#8217;21 earnings on August 2nd. Some of the company&#8217;s high level highlights, both financial and operational, can be seen outlined below:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Gross Profit of $1.14B, a 91% increase on a YoY basis, with Cash App generating $546M in Gross Profit and the Seller Ecosystem generating $585M, a 91% and 94% YoY increase, respectively.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Adjusted EBITDA of $360M, a 53% increase YoY.</p></li><li><p>Net Income of $204M.</p></li><li><p>A majority stake ownership in Tidal was completed in April.</p></li><li><p>Company announced intention to acquire Afterpay, a deal that is anticipated to close in the early part of 2022.</p></li><li><p>Launched Square Banking in July, an effort aimed at improving the ease at which businesses can manage their cash flows and get more out of their money.</p></li></ul><p>With these highlights in mind, let&#8217;s dig a little deeper.</p><p><em><strong>Income Statement&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p><em>Revenue</em></p><p>Square&#8217;s Revenue for the quarter came in at ~$4.68B, a value that has been hard pressed to decelerate over the last few years. Looking at how Total Revenue has changed on a YoY basis is in my opinion, misleading, mainly due to the constituents this value includes. More specifically, Total Revenue includes the sum of the value of all of the Bitcoin Transactions completed on the platform. As such, in order to better reflect how Square&#8217;s business is actually performing, let&#8217;s take a look at how Total Revenue, less bitcoin has changed over the last few quarters:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a480779-f3bd-4751-9388-d423b3f04ff9_586x304.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a480779-f3bd-4751-9388-d423b3f04ff9_586x304.png" width="586" height="304" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9a480779-f3bd-4751-9388-d423b3f04ff9_586x304.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:304,&quot;width&quot;:586,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a480779-f3bd-4751-9388-d423b3f04ff9_586x304.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a480779-f3bd-4751-9388-d423b3f04ff9_586x304.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a480779-f3bd-4751-9388-d423b3f04ff9_586x304.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a480779-f3bd-4751-9388-d423b3f04ff9_586x304.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Change in Total Revenue, Less Bitcoin</figcaption></figure></div><p>Important is the fact that Square&#8217;s business is accelerating regardless of their hard-pressed adoption of cryptocurrencies, particularly within the Cash App Ecosystem.

I am most excited about the improvements in the Subscription/Services Revenue attributable to Cash App, of which is attributable to transaction fees for the Cash Card and associated instant deposit. Cash App acting as a closed loop payment system represents an enormous value proposition and the more users that leverage the app as such, the better. Lastly, although the Bitcoin Revenue viewed as Revenue in the traditional sense is misleading, it offers a useful insight into the potential organic growth effects it may have (i.e. people sending bitcoin, buying bitcoin and becoming familiar with the ecosystem etc.). Despite a 211% increase on a YoY basis, there was a noticeable dip QoQ in Bitcoin Revenue. This value is largely correlated with activity in the crypto space, rising and falling in a proportional manner to overall crypto trading volume. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2145408d-c256-4bce-a4a7-f145e67aaf22_480x288.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2145408d-c256-4bce-a4a7-f145e67aaf22_480x288.png" width="480" height="288" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2145408d-c256-4bce-a4a7-f145e67aaf22_480x288.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:288,&quot;width&quot;:480,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2145408d-c256-4bce-a4a7-f145e67aaf22_480x288.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2145408d-c256-4bce-a4a7-f145e67aaf22_480x288.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2145408d-c256-4bce-a4a7-f145e67aaf22_480x288.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2145408d-c256-4bce-a4a7-f145e67aaf22_480x288.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Change in Cash App BTC Revenue</figcaption></figure></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3cc88eb-55ae-4bc2-a396-db68315d7328_1516x679.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3cc88eb-55ae-4bc2-a396-db68315d7328_1516x679.png" width="1456" height="652" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c3cc88eb-55ae-4bc2-a396-db68315d7328_1516x679.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:652,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:111918,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3cc88eb-55ae-4bc2-a396-db68315d7328_1516x679.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3cc88eb-55ae-4bc2-a396-db68315d7328_1516x679.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3cc88eb-55ae-4bc2-a396-db68315d7328_1516x679.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3cc88eb-55ae-4bc2-a396-db68315d7328_1516x679.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Bitcoin 3 yr Chart, Peaking in Q1 similar to Cash App BTC Revenue - Koyfin</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Gross Profit</em></p><p>In comparison to Revenue, Gross Profit may offer a better insight into how Square&#8217;s business is performing.

Square&#8217;s marketing efforts as well as the organic growth that the ecosystem sees with continued user activity should continue to drive this further in the coming quarters.

During my research I came across a CNN Article  with Jim McKelvey, the co-founder of Square, wherein he discussed how Square was able to survive Amazon&#8217;s competitive onslaught in the early 2010s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/10/tech/square-amazon-jim-mckelvey/index.html">[28]</a>. He stated that the companies that were able to innovate the entire stack were the ones that were the most difficult to unseat. The stack, in a software engineering sense of the word, contains everything ranging from the databases to the front-end of the software that makes things pleasant to look at and interact with. In the payment-processing world, this refers to catering towards the full realm of experience, from the card-reader to the POS software that is associated with it, and much more.&nbsp;Square&#8217;s seller ecosystem, i.e. the beautifully simple UX and capabilities of its software as well as the ease at which it can be integrated with associated hardware, makes Square hard to unseat. Although many would like to tout the looming competition offered by entities like Toast, or Lightspeed, I don&#8217;t believe these companies are serious threats against Square. They may have a product that tailors better towards a particular customer segment, however, they lack the fully integrated nature of Square&#8217;s ecosystem. In my opinion, this is only made stronger with the recent activities of Square Capital. Creating the financial tools to serve Square&#8217;s customers when they need them will only improve stickiness and I am excited to see where the future takes this part of Square&#8217;s business.&nbsp;</p><p>Organic Marketing, though typically associated with the Cash App brand, is making its way over to the seller ecosystem as a result of recent company efforts. More specifically, the TikTok x Square partnership announced on Tuesday of this week, represents a huge opportunity to continue to drive GPV and adoption growth in the Seller business segment. Allowing creators to send TikTok users directly to their Square store, the company will be able to leverage the fact that nearly 50% of TikTok&#8217;s 1 Billion Active Users have purchased a product after seeing it advertised within the application <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/square-tiktok-51632861008">[29]</a>.&nbsp; Undoubtedly this partnership will result in both higher adoption of Square&#8217;s software, but will also offer an unfathomable amount of eyes on their offerings by way of network effects.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F038238a7-119c-4ebf-b530-6f1ffd5098ac_1280x720.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F038238a7-119c-4ebf-b530-6f1ffd5098ac_1280x720.png" width="1280" height="720" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/038238a7-119c-4ebf-b530-6f1ffd5098ac_1280x720.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:720,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Canada Takes Over TikTok: Canadian Tiktokers to Follow in 2021 - View the  VIBE Toronto&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Canada Takes Over TikTok: Canadian Tiktokers to Follow in 2021 - View the  VIBE Toronto" title="Canada Takes Over TikTok: Canadian Tiktokers to Follow in 2021 - View the  VIBE Toronto" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F038238a7-119c-4ebf-b530-6f1ffd5098ac_1280x720.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F038238a7-119c-4ebf-b530-6f1ffd5098ac_1280x720.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F038238a7-119c-4ebf-b530-6f1ffd5098ac_1280x720.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F038238a7-119c-4ebf-b530-6f1ffd5098ac_1280x720.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Tik Tok Logo <a href="https://viewthevibe.com/canada-takes-over-tiktok-canadian-tiktokers-to-follow-in-2021/">[30]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Moving on to the Cash App, I believe the acquisition of Tidal is illustrative of the overall strategy I see Square taking with this business segment, and how I believe this will translate into the creation of Long Term Value. On May 4th it was announced that Square had acquired a majority ownership in Tidal, a subscription-based music and video streaming service <a href="https://squareup.com/ca/en/press/tidal">[31]</a>. To many this was a head-scratcher, did Square really want to test its luck in the music industry? To me, this acquisition made perfect sense, given the obscene amounts of organic marketing and resultant Cash App user-base growth this deal will result in. Cash App has not been shy about its S&amp;M efforts, particularly within the pop-culture realm. More specifically, the likes of Cardi B, Lil Nas X and Megan Thee Stallion have all partnered with Cash App in the past, offering individuals the chance to win cash prizes if they were registered within the app ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0afcad2d-a5c9-4bdc-b409-6d2bd9195fa1_510x566.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0afcad2d-a5c9-4bdc-b409-6d2bd9195fa1_510x566.png" width="510" height="566" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0afcad2d-a5c9-4bdc-b409-6d2bd9195fa1_510x566.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:566,&quot;width&quot;:510,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0afcad2d-a5c9-4bdc-b409-6d2bd9195fa1_510x566.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0afcad2d-a5c9-4bdc-b409-6d2bd9195fa1_510x566.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0afcad2d-a5c9-4bdc-b409-6d2bd9195fa1_510x566.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0afcad2d-a5c9-4bdc-b409-6d2bd9195fa1_510x566.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Celebrity Cash App Shotuouts <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/cardi-b-lil-nas-x-megan-thee-stallion-money-to-fans/">[32]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>With this go-to-market strategy, Square is leveraging the power of social media to get more views on the Cash app product and ecosystem as a whole. When taking into consideration the fact that hip hop industry most definitely has a love affair with the product, with 200+ hip hop songs from varieties of artists mentioning Cash App somewhere within their songs, the Tidal acquisition starts to make a lot of sense <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/korihale/2021/05/04/what-squares-350-million-tidal-acquisition-means-for-its-music-industry-ambitions/?sh=5fc7c982172a">[33]</a>. The artist base on the platform, which are a form of business entities in themselves, can both use the product, which Square can obviously benefit from, and then leverage these artists in sales and marketing campaigns in an organically exponential manner that would not be possible with traditional customer acquisition strategies.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, the efforts that Square is directing at the closed-loop payment space are, in my opinion, something to be excited about. An open-loop payment system is essentially one that runs on the rails so to speak, i.e. has a functionality that is directly reliant on the card providers, Mastercard and Visa. Reliance requires a share of the pie and as such Square has to direct a percentage of the fee they charge for payment processing back at the rails after processing payments. In a closed-loop system, i.e. the one that Square is trying to build with Cash App, this middle step is skipped altogether, with Square being able to keep the full processing fee pie for themselves when the cardholder and seller exchange funds directly.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08dbd986-f4c0-4638-bfb3-3a1a5b86773b_2048x1365.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08dbd986-f4c0-4638-bfb3-3a1a5b86773b_2048x1365.png" width="1456" height="970" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/08dbd986-f4c0-4638-bfb3-3a1a5b86773b_2048x1365.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:970,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08dbd986-f4c0-4638-bfb3-3a1a5b86773b_2048x1365.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08dbd986-f4c0-4638-bfb3-3a1a5b86773b_2048x1365.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08dbd986-f4c0-4638-bfb3-3a1a5b86773b_2048x1365.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08dbd986-f4c0-4638-bfb3-3a1a5b86773b_2048x1365.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/cash-app-pay">[34]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>For the sake of further illustration, as recently announced, Cash App Pay will allow consumers to pay with their Cash App accounts at participating Square Sellers.

These services are contained within an all-encompassing platform, of which can be classified as a PaaS, or Platform as a Service. Snowflake&#8217;s platform, or the Data Cloud so to speak, is an ecosystem that enables customers to aggregate and consolidate data into one single source, of which can then be used as a foundation to complete business analytics processes, create custom-built applications, facilitate artificial intelligence and machine learning insights, and share data and results in a cross-organizational manner. Snowflake&#8217;s platform is utilized by entities that are both big and small, as well as situated across various Geographic locations and industries&nbsp; <a href="https://finviz.com/">[2]</a>.</p><p>We now have a rough understanding of what Snowflake does and what they offer their customers. With this general overview in mind, let&#8217;s take a look at the opportunity that Snowflake has in front of it, of which they aim to capitalize upon both with in current operations and within future growth initiatives.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>2.0 Opportunity&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Although citing the Total Big Data Market Size as Snowflake&#8217;s Total Addressable Market is misleading, it is still of analytical importance as it allows for comparisons to be made between current Big Data activity and associated projections. More specifically, in 2020, it was estimated that the Total Global Big Data Market in 2020 was approximately $130.7B, a value which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.2% in between the 2020 and 2026 forecast periods, reaching a Total Value of $234.6B <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-big-data-market-to-reach-234-6-billion-by-2026--301322252.html">[3]</a>. More company-specific, the size of the global data warehousing market was valued at $21.2B in 2019 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.7% up until 2028, reaching a value of $52.2B . With Snowflake catering towards approximately 5,000 customers as of Q2&#8217;21, of which consist of approximately 42.4% of the Fortune 500, it is evident that there is a current demand for Snowflake&#8217;s services, especially from some of the world&#8217;s biggest corporate spenders <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001640147/8c2ff724-a272-4a7d-a758-81f439784e7e.pdf">[4]</a>, of which is likely to translate into future demand within the coming quarters and years.&nbsp;</p><p>Snowflake&#8217;s opportunity stems from a series of inter-organizational and multi-industry trends that have arisen alongside the ever growing societal, cultural and corporate prevalence of technology and data in general. Centuries ago, the Industrial Revolution transported individuals away from the farmstead and instead placed them in factories. The widespread mechanization of mankind laid the foundations for the second Industrial Revolution and the inevitable reliance on oil and fossil fuels that came with it. Since then, many would argue that the Knowledge Revolution has been well underway, shifting jobs out of factories into office environments. The technological improvements that made this change possible shuffled the role of the world&#8217;s most important commodity away from oil, crowning data in its place. As such, the need for organizations to properly leverage their data has never been greater. This commodity is at the heart of almost every modern process improvement and innovation, with the transformation of data from a fragmented entity into KPIs, insights and precursors for decision making being of undoubtable importance.&nbsp;</p><p>The magnitude of the Big Data opportunity is evident, however, there are a series of additional technological trends that will need to be paid attention to in order for Snowflake to constantly cater towards the infrastructure and consumption habits of the modern enterprise. Firstly, the cloud has arguably become one of the most important components of a corporation&#8217;s infrastructure. In 2020, a study performed by Gartner estimated that approximately 83% of Enterprise Workloads were in the cloud, 94% of US enterprises have used or are already using a cloud service, and an estimated 30% of surveyed businesses&#8217; IT budgets are being directed at cloud computing-related expenditures <a href="https://hostingtribunal.com/blog/cloud-adoption-statistics/#gref">[5]</a>.&nbsp; Secondly, the manner in which technology is being consumed has changed. Gone are the days where rigid licenses or packages can cater towards an organization&#8217;s multifaceted needs. This is where the rise of SaaS comes into play, with a utility model of software provision having an evident popularity over the last decade, and for good reason, seeing as it caters towards a business in a fully customizable and unique manner. These trends, when applied to the Big Data industry are quite simple, essentially equating to a need for data warehouse solutions that are compatible with modern cloud infrastructure, as well as customizable in a manner similar to SaaS counterparts.&nbsp;</p><p>With Snowflake&#8217;s Cloud-based PaaS business model, the company aims to leverage the aforementioned occurrences to become one of the world&#8217;s most valuable companies.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>3.0 Value Proposition&nbsp;</strong></p><p>With opportunity comes challenges. Current Data Technologies on the market leave much to be desired, struggling to extract value from current architecture and legacy databases. A 2020 study performed by the Harvard Business Review, by where C-level technology and business executives were surveyed, ranging from those situated at American Express to Johnson and Johnson, yielded some astonishing results. More specifically, 72% of these executives stated they were struggling to build a data-driven culture, 53% stated they were not yet leveraging data as a business asset and 52% said they were falling behind on the data and analytics front <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/02/companies-are-failing-in-their-efforts-to-become-data-driven">[6]</a>. These results are evidently stunning, but where exactly do these data challenges arise from and what do current technologies leave to be desired?&nbsp;</p><p>The main issues that current data warehouse solutions run into, in my opinion, can be stated as follows:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Lack of support for Data Volume and Diversity</p></li><li><p>Poor Cost and Time Effectiveness in both Implementation and Maintenance</p></li><li><p>Burdensome UX</p></li><li><p>Inability to cater towards Geographically diverse Enterprises</p></li></ul><p>The first issue is of extreme importance. Modern enterprises struggle with storing and maintaining massive amounts of data, often suffering from the presence of fragmented data lakes and silos that are not accessible across all corners of an organization. Disparate solutions are often accompanied by data duplication and inefficient processes. This lack of structure becomes a real issue when an organization tries to extract value from large datasets, with disjointed architecture reducing the feasibility of executing time-effective queries. Secondly, trying to develop and maintain data solutions in-house are both capital and time-intensive, resulting in a stagnation of a company&#8217;s data efforts as a result.&nbsp; Lastly, traditional legacy database and big data architecture are often difficult to work with from a user experience standpoint, and do not cater towards the ever-changing geographic residency and data sharing requirements of modern corporations. When coupled with the fact that most institutions' legacy data systems are intertwined with cloud providers in a constrained manner, i.e. only able to run in specific regions, a series of challenges arise when attempting to distribute data and insights across organizations with presence in various locations.&nbsp;</p><p>Snowflake aims to solve all of these aforementioned issues, leveraging their Data Cloud solution in order to reduce the presence of Data Silos, i.e. the presence of data repositories that can only be controlled and accessed by one department, isolated from the rest of an organization. By providing solutions that support data diversity and scalability, bolster a high performance relative to the price paid for the PaaS, and focus on ease-of-use and multi-faceted geographic/cloud requirements, Snowflake&#8217;s customers yield a series of benefits, as outlined by the image below:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb408670c-0b1c-410f-b957-b910c5183731_1521x844.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb408670c-0b1c-410f-b957-b910c5183731_1521x844.png" width="1456" height="808" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b408670c-0b1c-410f-b957-b910c5183731_1521x844.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:808,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb408670c-0b1c-410f-b957-b910c5183731_1521x844.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb408670c-0b1c-410f-b957-b910c5183731_1521x844.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb408670c-0b1c-410f-b957-b910c5183731_1521x844.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb408670c-0b1c-410f-b957-b910c5183731_1521x844.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Customer Benefits</figcaption></figure></div><p>Now that we have an understanding of the value proposition Snowflake directs at their clients, let&#8217;s roll up our sleeves and try to dissect the company&#8217;s product.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>4.0 Product Breakdown&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In simple terms, Snowflake&#8217;s product is essentially a fully managed cloud data warehouse.&nbsp; In order to understand how this product functions, we must first understand how it intersects with a businesses&#8217; processes.

This data, whether it be structured or semi-structured (Snowflake supports both of these well), originates from sources ranging from sensors and legacy databases to APIs and standard files. Data from these aforementioned example sources are then absorbed via ETL or ELT processes. Standing for Extract, Transform, Load or Extract, Load, Transform, respectively, these methods differ in the fact that the former is extracted from data sources, deposited in a staging area and then loaded into a data warehouse whereas the latter transforms the data after it has been loaded. Once the data has been ingested into the Snowflake Lakehouse (contains both Data Warehouses or Data Lakes depending on the transformation process that data has been put through) Data Consumers can execute queries to then derive some sort of operational value from said data, ranging from things such as analytics reporting and custom-built machine learning applications to secure data pooling.</p><p>The Snowflake intermediary outlined in the flow diagram above, essentially exists in three unique and distinct layers, of which result in the platform&#8217;s distinct functionality: centralized storage, multi-cluster compute and cloud services. The first layer is the company&#8217;s cloud storage layer, of which allows clients to store data of both structured and unstructured varieties. Being that this layer is run separately from the compute layer, there is an inherent scalability that would not be possible utilizing typical legacy data storage methods (one can think about the capital expenditures required to purchase and maintain a host of new servers). Within this layer, data ingestion, compression and storage are all fully managed by Snowflake, accessible to users via SQL queries. The second layer, multi-cluster compute, leverages the power of the cloud in order to both execute queries expediently and manage resources effectively. Being that these requests are executed in a massively parallel processing manner, query results are fast and also give clients the option to partition virtual data warehouses in a manner that aligns with their various departments (i.e. virtual data warehouses for accounting, finance etc.). Also important is the fact that users of snowflake can choose how much compute they require (associated with a particular cost) before performing any sort of analysis, leading to cost effectiveness. Lastly, cloud services act as the grease within the cogs of Snowflake's ever-complex machinery, performing tasks ranging from authentication and access control to metadata and infrastructure management.&nbsp;</p><p>All of these features tie into a truly unique product, of which offers a host of benefits to the customers that decide to leverage its power. In order to truly grasp the use-cases, it is imperative that one understands the value proposition of a fully managed data warehouse solution. Corporations, on average, direct extensive amounts of time and capital at the design/creation and management of legacy databases. Snowflake&#8217;s PaaS, is a fully managed service and allow for a company&#8217;s roster of Data Engineers to re-focus their efforts on higher level tasks and analysis instead of spending a large part of their time on rudimentary and monotonous data warehouse maintenance work. In addition, Data Engineers can also rest assured at the fact that Snowflake&#8217;s platform components are spread across multiple data centers in order to ensure availability, ACID compliant, i.e. solutions align with database transactions standards that ensure validity and reduce the prevalence of errors and fail-safe, i.e. data deletions and modifications are fully reversible and modifiable for a period of seven days. These factors, when considered from the perspective of a corporation, lead to an inherent stickiness, i.e. a recognition that the same capabilities and functionality would be difficult to duplicate in-house with similar effectiveness.&nbsp;</p><p>Another factor to consider,&nbsp;is the manner in which Snowflake stays cloud-agnostic. Not only does this lead to Snowflake&#8217;s platform being able to exist as an entity that is not overwhelmed by competitive forces, but it also leads to a very developer friendly experience. With support&nbsp;for Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, Snowflake aligns themselves with the cloud consumption habits of the modern enterprise. Flexera&#8217;s 2021 State of the Cloud report corroborate this fact further, finding that 92% of surveyed enterprises leverage a multi-cloud strategy (combination of public cloud services)&nbsp; whereas 80% utilize a hybrid cloud strategy (mix of on-premises, private cloud and public cloud services) <a href="https://www.cmswire.com/information-management/why-enterprises-are-bringing-their-workloads-to-multi-cloud-environments/">[8]</a>. The fact that Snowflake&#8217;s product tailors towards these use-cases should continue to aid with their rate of adoption in the near future.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that we have a better understanding of

These units of measure are Snowflake&#8217;s way of maintaining their inherent cost efficiency, allowing for customers to only pay for the resources they require for their various workflows. The Compute layer of Snowflake&#8217;s service utilizes credits and differs depending on the size of the chosen data warehouse. The size of the data warehouses can effectively be thought of as the size of the compute engine that powers query execution, evidently speeding up as the size of the virtual data warehouse increases. A table of the credits consumed per hour (CCPH), based upon the virtual warehouse size can be seen outlined below:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F692e352b-4956-465c-8b65-25305f75000e_640x78.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F692e352b-4956-465c-8b65-25305f75000e_640x78.png" width="640" height="78" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/692e352b-4956-465c-8b65-25305f75000e_640x78.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:78,&quot;width&quot;:640,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:6723,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F692e352b-4956-465c-8b65-25305f75000e_640x78.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F692e352b-4956-465c-8b65-25305f75000e_640x78.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F692e352b-4956-465c-8b65-25305f75000e_640x78.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F692e352b-4956-465c-8b65-25305f75000e_640x78.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Compute, on average, costs $0.00056 per second, per credit. As an example, if a customer were to leverage a 4XL sized data warehouse for the span of an hour, it would cost approximately $258.05 (3600s x $0.00056 credit/second x 128 credit consumed/hr). As previously mentioned, Snowflake focuses on cost efficiency. By allowing customers to place virtual warehouses on sleep mode, they don&#8217;t incur costs when they&#8217;re not in use, in comparison to traditional legacy database systems.

The total is split into a cost for data storage requirements and the Snowflake Credits that will be required for Compute and Cloud Services-related processes.

Though useful to get a general sense of what to expect from Snowflake in the periods to come, one must remember that customer consumption doesn&#8217;t occur on a fixed basis, differing on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Total Customers:</strong></em> Relatively self-explanatory, total customers reflect the number of unique contracts that Snowflake has on the go. This value doesn&#8217;t include the entities that utilize Snowflake in on-demand capacity.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Net Revenue Retention:</strong></em> Based upon a trailing two measurement period (2 years up to and including the most recent reporting period), this value is calculated by first determining the customers that utilized the platform in the first month of the first year of the measurement period, then dividing the Year Two Product Revenues attributable to these customers by the Year One Product Revenues attributable to the same customers. This value is not only indicative of future prospects but also reflective of the overall satisfaction of Snowflake&#8217;s current customer base, being that it gauges whether or not long-form customers are engaging with the platform in a more meaningful manner over time.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Customers with TTM Revenue &gt; $1M</strong></em><strong>:</strong> This value is self explanatory and highlights the relative success at which Snowflake is both scaling their business and obtaining important levels of operating leverage.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>7.0 Financial Analysis - Q2 FY&#8217;22 Earnings&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It should be noted that all dollar values mentioned from this point onwards will be in USD.&nbsp;</p><p>Snowflake reported their Q2 FY&#8217;22 earnings on August 25th.&nbsp; The company&#8217;s main highlights from the quarter, both financial and operational, can be seen outlined below:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Product Revenue of ~$255M, a 103% increase YoY&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Remaining Performance Obligations of $1.5B, a 122% YoY increase</p></li><li><p>4,990 Total Customers&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>169% Net Revenue Retention Rate</p></li><li><p>On a TTM (Trailing Twelve Month) basis 116 customers had Product Revenues greater than $1M&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Snowflake chairman and CEO Frank Slootman made the following comments regarding the company&#8217;s Q2 FY&#8217;22 performance <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001640147/b4be1de3-93fe-4e49-b2f0-cfad01dbb035.pdf">[15]</a>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Snowflake saw continued momentum in Q2 with triple-digit growth in product revenue, reflecting strength in customer consumption.

Although the company&#8217;s Gross Margins are high, this may be one of the main points of weakness when comparing Snowflake to other Data/SaaS companies that are able to boast values in the 70%+ range. Being that Snowflake is reliant on third-party cloud providers, i.e. AWS, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud, the company must sacrifice a small % of these margins in order for their product to be functional. Regardless, these values have improved over the years, seeing as in 2019 they were reported in the 40% range. Management directed significant effort at obtaining discounts per volume usage of third-party cloud providers, thus ensuring that Gross Margins should stay in the 60% range for the near future.&nbsp; Net Income, EBITDA and EBIT margins were all relatively similar, coming in for the quarter at (69.7)%, (71.6)% and (73.5)% respectively, and indicative of the company&#8217;s lack of profitability.

With Cloud Software being one of the fastest growing Business Avenues in the world today, Snowflake is undoubtedly standing out amongst the pack, showing why the market has valued it so highly. On a side note, one can speculate as to the root cause of Snowflake&#8217;s high Net Revenue Retention Rate, however, in my opinion, it can be described based upon the following phenomena. First, the company&#8217;s product is inherently &#8220;sticky&#8221;. That word gets tossed around quite a bit within the investment world but I believe it applies undoubtedly to Snowflake&#8217;s product. As a company&#8217;s data becomes more voluminous, as more data science, reporting, ML/AI and other solutions get built around the Snowflake&#8217;s lakehouse software, it becomes harder and harder for customers to obtain the same technological capabilities with other platforms, either developed in-house, or offered by competitors. Secondly, the time commitment required to become fully integrated with Snowflake&#8217;s software is no joke. Within the company&#8217;s Q1 FY&#8217;21 Investor Presentation, the Average Time from Start Date to Contract Consumption was approximately 212 days <a href="https://s26.q4cdn.com/463892824/files/doc_presentations/2021/06/Snowflake-Investor-Day-(External-for-Website)_vFINAL.pdf">[22]</a>. With company&#8217;s having to spend two thirds of a year patiently waiting to extract the full value capabilities of Snowflake&#8217;s platform, it becomes almost irresponsible for customers to leave the platform once they have been fully integrated with it. Although Snowflake&#8217;s team is currently working on decreasing the time-to-value of their platform, I do think this phenomenon will continue to maintain a high Net Revenue Retention Rate for the quarters to come, especially when coupled with the customer satisfaction of the product as a whole.&nbsp;</p><p>Of additional note is the activity of Snowflake&#8217;s Product Development team. More specifically, I believe the Financial Services Data Cloud product that they announced recently could be a big win for the company. This idea stemmed from a partnership with Blackrock&#8217;s Aladdin, resulting in the Financial Services Data cloud launch by where financial services firms can combine data in order to gain heightened insights and technological capabilities. This product, though in its infancy, highlights the power of Snowflake&#8217;s data sharing efforts and can, at the very least, be used as a source of learnings, of which can be applied to other industries and future company efforts.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8915df4b-0857-4fe6-ae17-570aed58c65a_1163x685.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8915df4b-0857-4fe6-ae17-570aed58c65a_1163x685.png" width="1163" height="685" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8915df4b-0857-4fe6-ae17-570aed58c65a_1163x685.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:685,&quot;width&quot;:1163,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8915df4b-0857-4fe6-ae17-570aed58c65a_1163x685.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8915df4b-0857-4fe6-ae17-570aed58c65a_1163x685.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8915df4b-0857-4fe6-ae17-570aed58c65a_1163x685.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8915df4b-0857-4fe6-ae17-570aed58c65a_1163x685.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/snowflake-launches-financial-services-data-cloud-touts-big-customer-wins/">[23]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>A last factor I believe is worth pondering is how Snowflake acts as a Switzerland within the data realm so to speak. Snowflake, embodying the spirit of a country that has remained neutral in many a conflict throughout history, utilizes this strategy to wane competitive forces within a rapid-paced industry. This theory can be corroborated when viewing Snowflake&#8217;s agnostic approach to third-party cloud providers, showing no preferential treatment to Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services, ensuring their clients are not suffering from vendor lockup when they decided to use their platform. Snowflake seems more likely to engage in partnerships with data companies rather than engage in competitive warfare, as can be seen when viewing a host of cloud, technology, data and service provider products they have up for display through a directory on their website.  Regardless, taking the partner rather than compete route will help Snowflake keep up with new Data trends and ensures customers never have to make a one or the other kind of decision.   </p><div><hr></div><p><strong>10.0 Risk Factors</strong> </p><p>Although Snowflake is one of the very best within the Data Warehousing Space the industry as a whole does not lack competition, of which, in my opinion, is one of the greatest risks that Snowflake faces with regards to the near future.

Although their technological capabilities are lacking when compared to those of Snowflake&#8217;s, it is well worth the worry when considering the resources of Amazon and the shear breadth of their customer base with regards to AWS. More specifically, as of Q2&#8217;21, it was estimated that 31% of the Cloud Infrastructure Market was controlled by AWS, followed by Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud with 22% and 8% respectively <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/967365/worldwide-cloud-infrastructure-services-market-share-vendor/">[25]</a>. One can only imagine the ease at which Redshift would be able to obtain customers if their product had similar capabilities given the fact so many entities are reliant on their tech. </p><p>Although Snowflake&#8217;s management is top-notch, their compensation, particularly within their IPO year was extremely high and is most definitely worth mentioning. For the sake of comparison, I took some of the fastest growing cloud companies and compared the total compensation (i.e. salary, option awards and bonuses) for the top three highest paid executives within the company during&nbsp;the year they went public.

The euphemism that value is expensive most definitely applies here and one must be completely sure that the company will be executing to the tee in the coming quarters. When looking at the company&#8217;s past there is a high chance the company&#8217;s vision comes into fruition, however, in a world full of uncertainty the valuation outlined above will be the first thing to be chopped down with any sign of material weakness or if execution ever falters. </p><div><hr></div><p><strong>11.0 Conclusion&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In a world with ever-increasing reams of data and an equally large need for solutions that allow customers to work with, manage, and extract value from said data, Snowflake stands out amongst its peers. Bolstering strong growth and optionality, an impressive and intuitive product, stellar management and evident customer satisfaction and engagement, there is a lot to like here. Being that as it may, a competitive landscape, Snowflake&#8217;s high compensation habits and evidently immense valuation multiples stand out to me as evident risks. With these facts considered, I believe Snowflake is definitely something I will be looking to gain exposure to in the near future. The opportunity and their growth is best-in-class and as such is difficult to ignore. I hope this research offered a starting point for one of the biggest players in the Data Cloud industry today.

The company operates through three unique and distinct segments, Lending, Financial Services and Technology. The Lending Arm has capabilities ranging from student loan refinancing, personal loans used for debt consolidations, loans for construction projects and home loans, to name a few. SoFi&#8217;s Financial Services Arm provides customers with borrowing, savings, spending, protection and investing related services.  The Technology side of the company&#8217;s business is rooted in the operation of Galileo, a platform that offers services to financial entities and other fintech operators. The company also bolsters Apex, a platform that is centered around brokerage and custody services <a href="https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=sofi">[2]</a> . Each of these business segments will be broken down in-depth in later sections of this report, but now, since we know a little bit more about what SoFi does, let&#8217;s take a look at the opportunities SoFi aims to capitalize upon.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>2.0 Opportunity </strong></p><p>Since the early 2000s, the number of FDIC-Insured Financial Institutions has decreased steadily, with approximately 8000 unique operators in existence at the beginning of the century, and only 4978 entities operating today <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/quarterly-banking-profile/statistics-at-a-glance/2021mar/industry.pdf">[3]</a>.   The FDIC is one of the two agencies that provides deposit insurance to depositors in the US, which essentially equates to a protection guarantee of sorts for up to $250,000 of an individual&#8217;s total deposits. This insurance is an intrinsic protection so to speak, giving people the confidence to trust their money with a Financial Institution. Although the number of approved institutions has decreased, the concentration of accounts has funneled its way into a group of Large Banks. SoFi estimates that there are over 500M US Accounts in FDIC insured banks, with over 50% of these accounts being associated with the largest 15 US Banks. Oftentimes, the larger the institution, the more rigid their operations and products offerings. Banks are no different, and this phenomenon has led to individuals seeking out the financial services they need from multiple locations, with over 50% of Americans interacting with more than one bank on a regular basis. It appears as if, now more than ever, there is a real need for a single platform capable of offering customers services and solutions for all of their financial needs. With the Financial Services Market in the US valued at approximately $2T (Trillion) at the end of 2020 <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001818874/d620cfd7-1889-47a5-99ca-e35e0f80caf2.pdf">[4]</a> and the Global Financial Services Market expected to reach a value of $22.9T by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 6% between the 2021-2025 forecast period <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/31/2202641/0/en/Financial-Services-Global-Market-Report-2021-COVID-19-Impact-And-Recovery-To-2030.html">[5]</a>, there is an evidently compelling opportunity that appears ready for SoFi&#8217;s taking.   </p><div><hr></div><p><strong>3.0 Value Proposition&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em><strong>Financial Services:&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p>SoFi aims its products and services at affluent users of financial services, of whom, by association, usually have both steady income flows and good credit scores to boot. This sounds fine and dandy, but you may be asking yourself how exactly the company aims to spur users to leave their current Financial Institutions and bring their business over with them. Banks today often suffer from the phenomenon of product and service fragmentation. In other words, the root cause of friction in the Financial Services sector is almost solely attributable to a disconnected product experience, of which leaves consumers trying to piece together a makeshift experience across many different entities on their own. SoFi, from inception, has focused on differentiating themselves from its peers by offering a digitized suite of products that cater towards any and all of a consumer&#8217;s financial needs. These products focus on four key differentiating factors, of which can be seen outlined below <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001818874/d620cfd7-1889-47a5-99ca-e35e0f80caf2.pdf">[6]</a>: </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5190d75-af4c-49bb-8fa2-874b08558154_1074x598.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5190d75-af4c-49bb-8fa2-874b08558154_1074x598.png" width="1074" height="598" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b5190d75-af4c-49bb-8fa2-874b08558154_1074x598.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:598,&quot;width&quot;:1074,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5190d75-af4c-49bb-8fa2-874b08558154_1074x598.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5190d75-af4c-49bb-8fa2-874b08558154_1074x598.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5190d75-af4c-49bb-8fa2-874b08558154_1074x598.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5190d75-af4c-49bb-8fa2-874b08558154_1074x598.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Four Differentiating Factors</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Fast: </em>SoFi is headfast on becoming the go-to location for expedient services. More specifically, they aim to offer speedy loan application processes and associated funding, account openings, stock purchase/sale settlements and more. Being that the company&#8217;s products are digitized, they not only facilitate ease-of-use, but also leverage a continuous feedback loop of data to spur iterative improvements within their inherent processes.</p><p><em>Selection: </em>The company&#8217;s technological capabilities and focus on the consistent betterment of customer experiences, leads to continuous additions being made to SoFi&#8217;s product roster. As of right now, SoFi offers customers different selections ranging from commission-less stock purchases, fractional shares, exclusive traded funds and a host of different cryptocurrencies. Going forwards, SoFi will continue to work on offering customers unique products that are sparse elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Content:</em> Despite the prowess of Educational Institutions, there exists a noticeable lack of financial knowledge within members of the general public. SoFi directs substantial effort at creating useful educational content, tools, consultations and directions that customers can use to alter their financial wellbeing for the better. The company incentivizes customers to engage with these offerings, through their inherent points/rewards system, of which are bestowed upon individuals for reaching content completions/milestones, and can then be redeemed within other sections of the company&#8217;s platform.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Convenience:</em> Like most tech companies, UX is a primary focus of all of SoFi&#8217;s offerings. Products cease to be great if they are not coupled with equally abundant and readily available support and service, thus the company is adamant on providing 24/7 access to assistance, if needed, in comparison to the dreaded 9-5 availability of the financial services industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>These four differentiating factors all work towards creating life-long relationships, of which possess an inherent long-form abundance of value. By exposing individuals to different products, all with a pleasant and responsive UX, SoFi believes customers are more likely to seek out additional assistance from their platform. What this results in is a Unit Economics Nirvana, i.e. the Average Revenue Per Customer (ARPC) increases across the total customer lifespan while total customer acquisition costs decrease as a result. This behavior ties into what SoFi labels as the Financial Services Productivity Loop, as seen outlined below, which the company believes they are in the early innings of cementing <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001818874/d620cfd7-1889-47a5-99ca-e35e0f80caf2.pdf">[7]</a>. &nbsp; </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1fb378aa-fad4-4000-a87b-a9159dc00573_1070x597.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1fb378aa-fad4-4000-a87b-a9159dc00573_1070x597.png" width="1070" height="597" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1fb378aa-fad4-4000-a87b-a9159dc00573_1070x597.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:597,&quot;width&quot;:1070,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1fb378aa-fad4-4000-a87b-a9159dc00573_1070x597.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1fb378aa-fad4-4000-a87b-a9159dc00573_1070x597.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1fb378aa-fad4-4000-a87b-a9159dc00573_1070x597.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1fb378aa-fad4-4000-a87b-a9159dc00573_1070x597.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">SoFi&#8217;s Financial Services Productivity Loop</figcaption></figure></div><p><em><strong>Bank Charter:&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p>Of equal importance to SoFi&#8217;s Growth is the fact that the company is directing substantial efforts at opening their own National Bank Charter. This process was started in 2020, with SoFi submitting an application to open a De Novo National Bank. The term De Novo essentially refers to a newly chartered bank that has not been acquired via purchase <a href="https://discover.jackhenry.com/new-banks#:~:text=A%20de%20novo%20bank%20is,or%20thrift%20bank%20and%20others">[8]</a>. Flashing forward to October of 2020, SoFi was granted a preliminary and conditional approval by the OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) for their De Novo Application. Since then, the company has been directing capital and other resources at building out the infrastructure required to adequately abide by regulations. This process is not a short one by any means. Applicants are subject to intense scrutiny from both the OCC (the regulatory body that oversees National Banks) and the Federal Reserve. Regulatory reviews primarily consist of compliance checks regarding the institution&#8217;s managerial, financial and capital adequacy. Before granting the go-ahead to open the Bank itself, both the OCC and the Federal Reserve must be comfortable with the institution&#8217;s business plan and profitability trajectory, amount of capital raised in order to sustain operations and ability to cater towards the financial needs of the demographics they will be targeting.&nbsp; SoFi switched gears slightly In March of this year,&nbsp; announcing that they had acquired Golden Pacific Bancorp for approximately $22.3M <a href="https://www.sofi.com/press/sofi-announces-agreement-acquire-golden-pacific-bancorp-inc/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_xvUM_vJ_x0jLtSye8_Uu0Ds_pzVDNJQyLj016C0c4_k-1630535636-0-gqNtZGzNAmWjcnBszQjR">[9]</a> and would be changing their current De Novo Application to that of a Change of Control Application. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2aa60240-89e6-4924-84b9-6d7f1151ad30_760x400.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2aa60240-89e6-4924-84b9-6d7f1151ad30_760x400.png" width="760" height="400" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2aa60240-89e6-4924-84b9-6d7f1151ad30_760x400.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:400,&quot;width&quot;:760,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2aa60240-89e6-4924-84b9-6d7f1151ad30_760x400.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2aa60240-89e6-4924-84b9-6d7f1151ad30_760x400.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2aa60240-89e6-4924-84b9-6d7f1151ad30_760x400.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2aa60240-89e6-4924-84b9-6d7f1151ad30_760x400.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Bank Charter <a href="https://www.atmmarketplace.com/news/sofi-fintech-acquires-golden-pacific-bancorp/">[10]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>This application process, although it required an updated business plan to be submitted, is of relatively similar structure to that of the De Novo, and builds upon the existing relationships SoFi had with the OCC and the Federal Reserve. The company plans to operate Golden Pacific Bank&#8217;s existing three-location footprint while also directing ~$750M at developing an associated digital ecosystem. Although there is no definitive date as to when one should expect this process to be completed, management was adamant within their most recent earnings call that the process was going smoothly, and they were abiding by all of the regulatory ad-hoc requests that had been coming their way <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4449012-sofi-technologies-inc-sofi-ceo-anthony-noto-on-q2-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript">[11]</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>You may be wondering what this means for customers, and how exactly directing copious amounts of capital at creating Bank Charter will improve SoFi&#8217;s value proposition. Let&#8217;s use an oversimplified description of SoFi&#8217;s loan process to take this point home. The cash SoFi provides their customers for a loan is cash they have obtained from a bank themselves in the form of a loan, of which they have to pay somewhere along the lines of 2-3% interest on. If SoFi were to open a Bank Charter on the other hand, they would only be paying 10-20bps on the funds, and would thus be able to provide customers with better rates or increase profits/margins if so desired. The company would also be able to FDIC insure any deposited funds, a safety blanket of sorts that most definitely allows customers to feel more secure with where they are holding their money. This process is of undoubtable importance and would greatly improve the capabilities of SoFi as a corporation. </p><div><hr></div><p><strong>4.0 Business Breakdown - Products and Services Offering</strong></p><p>As previously mentioned, the three main segments of SoFi&#8217;s business can be partitioned as follows: <em>Lending, Financial Services and Technology</em>.

Otherwise, the company offers 1% cash-back when redemptions are made towards a customer&#8217;s credit card statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>SoFi At Work</em></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4daf2240-1d75-49af-bae1-a3ebf46a8914_1071x534.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4daf2240-1d75-49af-bae1-a3ebf46a8914_1071x534.png" width="1071" height="534" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4daf2240-1d75-49af-bae1-a3ebf46a8914_1071x534.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:534,&quot;width&quot;:1071,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4daf2240-1d75-49af-bae1-a3ebf46a8914_1071x534.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4daf2240-1d75-49af-bae1-a3ebf46a8914_1071x534.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4daf2240-1d75-49af-bae1-a3ebf46a8914_1071x534.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4daf2240-1d75-49af-bae1-a3ebf46a8914_1071x534.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">SoFi At Work Homepage</figcaption></figure></div><p>This offering can be essentially be thought of as a comprehensive platform, of which employers can leverage in order to provide their employees access to SoFi-branded benefits plans, financial planning and tracking, student loan and 529 education plan contributions as well as a host of different educational resources.

More specifically, Galileo offers turnkey B2B (business to business) and B2C (business to consumer) solutions that allow for the easy integration of complex payment card programs and digital banking capabilities within a Corporation. This business can be thought of as a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), with Galileo&#8217;s API powering functionality ranging from account set-up and funding, ACH transfers, early paycheck direct deposit, point of sale authorizations and much more <a href="https://www.sofi.com/press/sofi-to-acquire-galileo?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_13pnxQ_dxB9U88j2Zq41eihyxD526_8zUhsAO2vvYWI-1630677432-0-gqNtZGzNAjujcnBszRP9">[23]</a>.&nbsp; As a result, Galileo&#8217;s value proposition is unique and undeniable within the Fintech space. Similar in essence to what SaaS companies offer their customers, Galileo offers Fintech Companies the backbone of which they can build their operations off of. The capital and time resources that would be required to build similar functionality in-house are enormous, making it much easier for businesses to turn to Galileo than to their own developers for obtaining the digital banking mechanisms.

be the main source of future growth in my opinion. I would not be surprised to see Technology as the primary constituent of Total Net Revenue in the future. The YoY and QoQ change in the number of Galileo accounts is testament to the industry-wide recognition of the platform&#8217;s power. When coupled with inherent stickiness, i.e. the lack of feasibility for developer teams to build similar digital banking solutions in-house, it is understandable why many are excited about this past acquisition&#8217;s value proposition.&nbsp;</p><p>Of equal analytical importance is how the disaggregated components of each reportable business segment have been functioning of late.

Macroeconomic conditions should drive a continued uptrend Personal Loans in the quarters to come. Although Lending Revenue is obviously the main driver behind the numbers SoFi has been posting, it is worth noting the resilient nature of SoFi&#8217;s business in relation to the macroeconomic environment. In high interest rate scenarios, personal loans perform really well whereas in low interest rate environments, home loan and student loan refinancing pick up the slack. Management attributed the Personal Loan success in the quarter to the rising rate environment of Q2.&nbsp;</p><p> The Revenue activity of the Financial Services business segment, and the YoY change can be seen outlined below: </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8fd82bb-981a-47ef-aae1-1707f834c15d_480x288.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8fd82bb-981a-47ef-aae1-1707f834c15d_480x288.png" width="480" height="288" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d8fd82bb-981a-47ef-aae1-1707f834c15d_480x288.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:288,&quot;width&quot;:480,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8fd82bb-981a-47ef-aae1-1707f834c15d_480x288.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8fd82bb-981a-47ef-aae1-1707f834c15d_480x288.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8fd82bb-981a-47ef-aae1-1707f834c15d_480x288.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8fd82bb-981a-47ef-aae1-1707f834c15d_480x288.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Financial Services Revenue Per Segment</figcaption></figure></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28c505af-6c18-4c11-86bf-0a1c0cd889dc_638x205.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28c505af-6c18-4c11-86bf-0a1c0cd889dc_638x205.png" width="638" height="205" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/28c505af-6c18-4c11-86bf-0a1c0cd889dc_638x205.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:205,&quot;width&quot;:638,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:10559,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28c505af-6c18-4c11-86bf-0a1c0cd889dc_638x205.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28c505af-6c18-4c11-86bf-0a1c0cd889dc_638x205.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28c505af-6c18-4c11-86bf-0a1c0cd889dc_638x205.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28c505af-6c18-4c11-86bf-0a1c0cd889dc_638x205.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">YoY Change in Financial Services Revenue Per Segment</figcaption></figure></div><p>The growth in the company&#8217;s Brokerage Revenue can be attributed to the heightened retail trading activity we have seen throughout the entirety of this speculative investment environment.

This act essentially suspended the repayment of and the accrual of interest on federal student loans. Being that many were not required to pay back their loans, SoFi&#8217;s revenue attributable to Student Loan Refinancing obviously took a hit. This Act was anticipated to come to an end at the end of this month (September 30th), however, the moratorium ended up being extended to January 31st, 2022. As a result, SoFi anticipates that they will see a $40M reduction in Student Loan Refinancing Revenue. Despite this fact, SoFi was able to maintain the Full Year Guidance they had previously given, made possible by the acceleration of SoFi&#8217;s other business segments.&nbsp;</p><p>Of equal importance to SoFi&#8217;s future success is the National Bank Charter; they are currently in the midst of attempting to open/run, as a result of their Change of Control Application. As previously insinuated, having a Bank Charter will allow for SoFi to greatly improve their Unit Economics. By cutting out the middle-man in the loan process so to speak, (i.e. another bank), as illustrated in the over-simplified lending process diagram below, the company will be able to improve the rates they offer their customers.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2b9a7cc-e281-430f-a180-5039edac762c_752x303.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2b9a7cc-e281-430f-a180-5039edac762c_752x303.png" width="752" height="303" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e2b9a7cc-e281-430f-a180-5039edac762c_752x303.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:303,&quot;width&quot;:752,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2b9a7cc-e281-430f-a180-5039edac762c_752x303.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2b9a7cc-e281-430f-a180-5039edac762c_752x303.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2b9a7cc-e281-430f-a180-5039edac762c_752x303.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2b9a7cc-e281-430f-a180-5039edac762c_752x303.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>As a result, spurious improvements in the company&#8217;s previously discussed feedback loop should occur, the company&#8217;s customer acquisition costs should decrease (low rates require less marketing etc. to sell) and when coupled with the Lending Segments inherently high contribution margins and profit, the company should experience a sudden influx of value.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, the company&#8217;s Galileo Platform, in my opinion, should be one of the main drivers in SoFi&#8217;s future success. Galileo, to me, isn&#8217;t a competitor within the FinTech Industry, it is the Fintech Industry. Directed at customers ranging from Neo Banks to Startups, Galileo provides services that are both in-demand (as corroborated by the addition of 22 new partners in 1H&#8217;21),&nbsp; jam packed with inherent stickiness (costs to reverse-engineer similar services in-house would be disastrous) and like other data players, the more data they get from a customer the deeper their teeth sink in, as a result of ever-improving models and algorithms. The Total Number of Accounts, at the moment, shows no signs of slowing down, with a ~119% increase YoY and 13% increase QoQ, and should continue pace into the coming quarters. When combined with the 28-30% Contribution Margin range that the Technology Platform seems to be settling into, Galileo should both drive Income generation in the future and with volume, hopefully reduce the concentration risk in SoFi&#8217;s Net Revenue that is apparent as a result of strong lending operations. </p><div><hr></div><p><em><strong>9.0 Risk Factors</strong></em></p><p>A topic of much discussion last week were the remarks Gensler (chair of SEC) made regarding payment for order flow practices.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0807621e-c03c-4f69-ad84-bca0243197b7_2048x1373.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0807621e-c03c-4f69-ad84-bca0243197b7_2048x1373.png" width="1456" height="976" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0807621e-c03c-4f69-ad84-bca0243197b7_2048x1373.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:976,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0807621e-c03c-4f69-ad84-bca0243197b7_2048x1373.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0807621e-c03c-4f69-ad84-bca0243197b7_2048x1373.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0807621e-c03c-4f69-ad84-bca0243197b7_2048x1373.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0807621e-c03c-4f69-ad84-bca0243197b7_2048x1373.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">SEC Chair Gensler <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/27/sec-steps-up-research-into-gamification-of-trading-with-online-brokers-gary-gensler-says.html  ">[29]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>&nbsp;More specifically, in an interview with Barron&#8217;s, Gensler raised the possibility that the SEC could ban PFOF, reasoning that it had created an evident conflict of interest and reduction in the clarity and fairness of market mechanisms <a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=11e3fc5e-8c12-479f-adc9-4c7933c76f33">[30]</a> . Although this decision, if enacted, would most likely have disastrous consequences on market functionality (volume for example), similar laws have been made official in Countries ranging from Canada to Australia. Therefore, to me it doesn&#8217;t seem out of the question. This risk, though not pertaining to the most recent news occurrence, was mentioned in SoFi&#8217;s most recent 10-Q, confirming the fact that the company is evidently aware of the negative impact this would have on their business. If this risk were to come into fruition, revenue associated with SoFi Invest, and thus the Financial Services Business segment, would be materially affected.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite attempting to be unique on many different avenues, SoFi evidently suffers from a host of competition. Whether it be from the likes of fast-paced companies like Upstart and Robinhood (on the loan and trading fronts respectively), payment facilitators such as Stripe and Paypal and other crowd-favourites like Square, there is no doubt that SoFi has competition.&nbsp;To me, in order for one to be long SoFi, they must have the utmost belief that SoFi&#8217;s products are unique enough when compared with competitors in order to stomach this playing field. In my own opinion, Galileo is the distinguishing factor between SoFi and its counterparts, and the addition of its Bank Charter may prove to be a competitive advantage with some of its lending and financial service products. As of right now, I would prefer to wait to see the continuation of growth in Galileo&#8217;s customer base, how the Bank Charter application plays out and how the company&#8217;s refinancing business recovers once the CARES act ends before going long.&nbsp;</p><p>The company&#8217;s Enterprise Value at the time of writing and valuation metrics based upon the company&#8217;s high end of FY&#8217;21 projections for Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Revenue can be seen outlined below: </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0409196-0761-4bde-adeb-e458be8c5ada_654x101.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0409196-0761-4bde-adeb-e458be8c5ada_654x101.png" width="654" height="101" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b0409196-0761-4bde-adeb-e458be8c5ada_654x101.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:101,&quot;width&quot;:654,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:6288,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0409196-0761-4bde-adeb-e458be8c5ada_654x101.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0409196-0761-4bde-adeb-e458be8c5ada_654x101.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0409196-0761-4bde-adeb-e458be8c5ada_654x101.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0409196-0761-4bde-adeb-e458be8c5ada_654x101.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>In my opinion SoFi is valued richly based upon these forward and idealized metrics (since they are adjusted values) and has a lot of grunt work/execution to do to settle into their EV.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, it is worth touching on the fact that SoFi may fall victim to their association with their SPAC counterparts and Chamath. Earlier this year SoFi went public via reverse merger with Social Capital Hedosophia V, a deal that then valued the company at ~$8.7B. With only approximately 20% of the companies that went public via SPAC merger trading above their $10 IPO price, SoFi may be one of the few that has escaped unscathed, however this may factor into in to investors not considering SoFi as a potential source of capital allocation regardless. </p><div><hr></div><p><em><strong>10.0 Conclusion&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p>In summary, SoFi is a strong player within the FinTech Industry. With Lending Operations that are leveraged by a host of customers, Financial Services that make SoFi a one-stop-shop so to speak, and Galileo, of which is the backbone of an enormous amount of companies within the FinTech space, there is a lot to like. Being that as it may, there are a host of risks ranging from potential PFOF bans to steep valuations and evident market saturation. I am neither long nor short the company but will be watching closely in the next few quarters to see if the company&#8217;s ambitions come to fruition.

The company offers two unique products, Foundry and Gotham, of which are connected by Apollo, Palantir&#8217;s Continuous Delivery System <a href="https://www.palantir.com/platforms/apollo/">[2]</a>. Gotham, the company&#8217;s product offering geared at Government entities, aims to comb through massive datasets, ranging from those provided by sensors to intelligence sources to informants, in order to provide and identify useful patterns, insights and information. The platform also aims to expedite and simplify the handoff process between analysts and operational entities, allowing for individuals to launch responses to threats identified by the software. Palantir Foundry, the product offering aimed at Corporate Individuals, simply stated, is a central OS for a company&#8217;s data, which allows for the easy integration and analysis of data in one, easy-to-access location <a href="https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=pltr&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d">[3]</a>. </p><p>Now that we have a rough understanding of what the company does, let&#8217;s look at the opportunity Palantir has in front of it and aims to target and leverage within their day-to-day operations and growth initiatives.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>2.0 Opportunity&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Big Data, defined as voluminous amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data that is collected over time, of which possesses an inherent velocity, complexity and diversity, represents an enormous opportunity for Palantir to capitalize on going forwards.

A description of each can be seen outlined below. It should be noted that I applied a very conservative 5% CAGR to the company&#8217;s 2020 TAM projections in order to be more reflective of the current landscape Palantir aims to address in 2021. </p><p><em><strong>Commercial</strong>: </em>The modified estimate of the TAM for the Commercial Sector is ~$59B. This projection is based upon a broad approximation of approximately 6,000 companies with more than $500M in yearly revenue as well as an assumed annual contract value for potential customers. Palantir Foundry has a wide range of capabilities and applications including but not limited to data management, application development, security, supply chain management and artificial intelligence etc. <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001321655/896d430c-206d-49a4-9ffb-b83d9bf6f758.pdf">[6]</a>, and thus a wide arsenal of potential clients.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Government:</strong></em> The modified estimate of the TAM in the government sector is ~$66B. This projection is based upon estimates surrounding total federal and state expenditures, with 5% of these total budgets being allocated towards software-based spend. The entities contained within this TAM are United States government agencies as well as its allies and other customers that align with liberal democracies <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001321655/896d430c-206d-49a4-9ffb-b83d9bf6f758.pdf">[7]</a>.&nbsp; To date, the company has worked with the US Army, Navy and Air Force, US Special Operations Command, Centers for Disease Control, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and many other high profile organizations. Palantir&#8217;s penetration in the military sector would not be where it is today if it were not for a 2016 lawsuit, by which Palantir sued the US Army for an unlawful procurement solicitation of the service&#8217;s next iteration of DCGS-A that shut the company&#8217;s commercial offering out of competition <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/03/29/palantir-who-successfully-sued-the-army-just-won-a-major-army-contract/">[8]</a>. The judge ruled in favor of Palantir based upon the fact that the federal government is obligated to consider choosing commercially available software before considering building their own functionality in-house. Revenue attributable to the Army has increased noticeably since. Also of note is the manner in which Palantir chooses their Government clients. If potential customers do not align with the idealisms of the United States or Palantir&#8217;s culture and mission, such as the Chinese Communist Party for example, they will not be considered. Although this decreases the breadth of the company&#8217;s TAM, I believe this will increase the depth and length of contracts with existing Government clients going forwards.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>3.0 Value Proposition&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As stated above, Big Data provides an astonishing opportunity for organizations to better their processes, operations and decision-making as a whole. However, the sheer breadth/size of datasets often appears in conjunction with a host of difficulties that companies will have to dampen in order to derive any meaningful value from their data. The structure of many company&#8217;s legacy data systems are disparate to say the least, commonly existing as unique point solutions (i.e. solutions designed to tackle a single problem) or custom applications built on top of fragmented data lakes <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/big-data/datalakes-and-analytics/what-is-a-data-lake/">[9]</a>. These ever-present phenomena often lead to the creation of data silos, i.e. a collection of data that is isolated from and not accessible by other components of a corporation, which is a serious roadblock in front of an entity&#8217;s data-driven decision making <a href="https://www.stitchdata.com/resources/data-silos/">[10]</a>. This is where Palantir comes in, separating itself from its data broker and data aggregator competitors and cementing its uniqueness in the form of a software company.&nbsp; More specifically, Palantir creates digital infrastructure for data-driven operations and decision making. Their products, simply put, can be thought of as connective-tissue of sorts, facilitating the intertwinement of an organization&#8217;s data, analytics and execution <a href="https://blog.palantir.com/palantir-is-not-a-data-company-palantir-explained-1-a6fcf8b3e4cb">[11]</a>.

Each of these cohorts will be analyzed within this section of this report.&nbsp;</p><p>Palantir&#8217;s two software products, Foundry and Gotham, are full-stack (i.e. with a back-end, front-end (graphical user interfaces with a firm focus on UX) and associated interconnectedness ) solutions that focus on aggregating and integrating data and providing frameworks to build knowledge systems. These systems maintain focus on collaboration and spur easy access to hosts of information and analysis. With this simplified description of the software&#8217;s&#8217; functionality in mind, let&#8217;s dig deeper into Foundry and Gotham.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Foundry</strong></em></p><p>Simply put, Foundry is data analytics software geared at Palantir&#8217;s corporate clients. This software exists in a series of distinct layers, all of which connect to each other and result in Palantir&#8217;s unique functionality. The first is the automated data connection layer. In essence it connects the various fragmented, disparate data sources of different structured and unstructured natures into a common, organized arrangement and provides the foundations for which the second and arguably the most important layer, the Ontology, is built upon. An example of hypothetical use case by where a manufacturing company&#8217;s various data sources are organized in an easy-to-digest hierarchy/organization, can be seen outlined below: </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4b81559-a42d-4772-853a-3e20a3fb2f7f_1864x904.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4b81559-a42d-4772-853a-3e20a3fb2f7f_1864x904.png" width="1456" height="706" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e4b81559-a42d-4772-853a-3e20a3fb2f7f_1864x904.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:706,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4b81559-a42d-4772-853a-3e20a3fb2f7f_1864x904.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4b81559-a42d-4772-853a-3e20a3fb2f7f_1864x904.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4b81559-a42d-4772-853a-3e20a3fb2f7f_1864x904.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4b81559-a42d-4772-853a-3e20a3fb2f7f_1864x904.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Turning Order into Chaos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4R1cOlJJ7o">[15]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>The second layer, the Ontology, creates a digital twin of the business that is applied to all downstream workflows ranging from search and analysis to operational applications. This should be thought of as an aggregation of sorts, in other words taking the organization&#8217;s data, assigning meaning or a function to it, and using that to create standardized building blocks for which all other aspects of the software will come back to. The Ontology also acts as a two-way interface between the company&#8217;s aggregated data and the real world, allowing for unique insights to be fed back into the businesses. This ties into the bi-directionality of this layer as a whole, which is a unique functionality of the product. Rather than attempting to rework new data sources into existing foundations, through the Ontology there exists a common framework where new data can automatically make its way into business workflows, an extremely useful proposition and spurring factor of cross-organizational collaboration. The Ontology ties itself into the third and more advanced layer of Foundry, Simulations / AI.&nbsp; In order to make better decisions, this layer creates models, which are imperative to deriving value out of the data building blocks created in the previous layer. These models can include deep-learning/AI processes or simple rules that adhere to quality/process standards outlined by members of executive teams. Leveraging the connective tissue of foundry, users of the platform can understand the impacts of a decision before they make it. This creates a code-like nature of introducing new business components, i.e. business changes can be rolled out in stages and tested, essentially creating a version of control of sorts within a complex organization. Moving on to the user layer, i.e. the central decision support infrastructure, this area of the software is where users can make inferences regarding active models, utilize low-code/no-code widgets to generate new insights/reports, utilize and build their own &#8220;what-if'' statements to complete complex and multifaceted data analysis in very little time. This layer also allows users to connect directly and simply with legacy ERP systems, taking raw data, joining it, making inferences regarding the connections between database tables and more. All in all, if you&#8217;ve ever worked with data in any capacity in your professional life, the functionality of Foundry is revolutionary, stunning and simply phenomenal to say the least.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In order to better understand what I previously outlined above, let&#8217;s take a look at a real-world example of how Palantir&#8217;s software assisted Scuderia Ferrari. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe21ac61d-0f5a-4759-a3b5-4feaa77ec848_713x470.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe21ac61d-0f5a-4759-a3b5-4feaa77ec848_713x470.png" width="713" height="470" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e21ac61d-0f5a-4759-a3b5-4feaa77ec848_713x470.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:470,&quot;width&quot;:713,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe21ac61d-0f5a-4759-a3b5-4feaa77ec848_713x470.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe21ac61d-0f5a-4759-a3b5-4feaa77ec848_713x470.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe21ac61d-0f5a-4759-a3b5-4feaa77ec848_713x470.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe21ac61d-0f5a-4759-a3b5-4feaa77ec848_713x470.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Palantir x Ferrari <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4R1cOlJJ7o">[16]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Formula-One is an undoubtedly complex sport, of which has relied upon data for a very long time. Each car comes outfitted with many sensors that measure performance, reliability and a host of other metrics. During a Formula One race, sensors relay data at up to 1000Hz, amounting to 1000 instances of data being recorded per second. With data volume comes siloed systems, which undoubtedly spurred the Ferrari racing team to seek out the assistance of Palantir Software.  Palantir was able to aggregate all of the data into a Central OS, replace existing tools and automate repetitive analyses, and also allow for engineers to test new hypotheses in fast-paced circumstances via simulations and AI models. This functionality was made possible by a central learning loop present within Palantir&#8217;s system, of which records the data, decisions made by operators and associated outcomes in order to improve the inherent knowledge base and thus the likelihood of more accurate decisions being made in the future <a href="https://www.palantir.com/build/files/scuderia-ferrari-whitepaper.pdf">[17]</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Gotham</strong></em></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4ff96788-771c-4f48-85eb-a4246c3c57a8_1072x833.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4ff96788-771c-4f48-85eb-a4246c3c57a8_1072x833.png" width="1072" height="833" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4ff96788-771c-4f48-85eb-a4246c3c57a8_1072x833.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:833,&quot;width&quot;:1072,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4ff96788-771c-4f48-85eb-a4246c3c57a8_1072x833.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4ff96788-771c-4f48-85eb-a4246c3c57a8_1072x833.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4ff96788-771c-4f48-85eb-a4246c3c57a8_1072x833.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4ff96788-771c-4f48-85eb-a4246c3c57a8_1072x833.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Gotham Graphic <a href="https://www.palantir.com/platforms/gotham/">[18]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Gotham, the first software platform that Palantir built, is a product geared at Government Entities and members of the Intelligence Community (both the United States, Allies and members that align with the democratic interests of the West).

users with a series of options, of which can be run in conjunction with simulations and AI models in order to arrive at honed-down decisions that have evolved in response to constantly changing data sources. The inherent nature of this stage, i.e. the ability for the results of decision to be fed back into the system as data, is invaluable and allows for AI/ML models to get better as they make their way deeper into an Enterprise&#8217;s decision making. Lastly, the Act stage is where Gotham shines in comparison to traditional data analytics platforms. More specifically, Gotham is able to be deployed on the edge, i.e. as a process that is able to execute on hardware devices that are able to process information without streaming or storing data in the cloud <a href="https://www.telusinternational.com/articles/what-is-edge-ai-computing">[22]</a>. This software, similar to Foundry, also allows for modules (low-code/no-code functionality) to be deployed on the fly during intense situations, shortening the time it takes to gain valuable analytical capabilities. All in all, with Gotham&#8217;s ever-improving functionality, connection to the most powerful institutions in the world via long-form contracts and projects, and inherent stickiness that comes with Palantir&#8217;s products, it is hard not to like the value creation prospects that this product possesses for the business as a whole. </p><p><em><strong>Apollo</strong></em></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F798a05cc-2011-4a59-a433-acce42a9c2a9_1400x776.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F798a05cc-2011-4a59-a433-acce42a9c2a9_1400x776.png" width="1400" height="776" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/798a05cc-2011-4a59-a433-acce42a9c2a9_1400x776.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:776,&quot;width&quot;:1400,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F798a05cc-2011-4a59-a433-acce42a9c2a9_1400x776.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F798a05cc-2011-4a59-a433-acce42a9c2a9_1400x776.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F798a05cc-2011-4a59-a433-acce42a9c2a9_1400x776.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F798a05cc-2011-4a59-a433-acce42a9c2a9_1400x776.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Apollo Graphic <a href="https://blog.palantir.com/palantir-apollo-powering-saas-where-no-saas-has-gone-before-7be3e565c379">[23]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Apollo, can be thought of chocolate chips in the Foundry and Gotham cookie so to speak, powering Palantir&#8217;s software, and acting as a continuous delivery system that allows for the company to cater towards their clients many different edge cases.

This is all done with an utmost focus on stability. As a result, Apollo shines past traditional SaaS architecture catering towards all varieties of network topologies and processes higher up the tech stack, such as with AI/ML lifecycle model maintenance.&nbsp; Global presence also allows Palantir to meet the ever-evolving data residency requirements of their clients. This functionality increases the feature velocity of Gotham and Foundry and also allows for ridiculously fast onboarding times. More specifically, onboarding can occur in a few hours (this would take competitors days or more) and updates can be rolled out to entire fleets of software users up to 41,000 times per week. To me, this is an evident Unit Economic Nirvana. More specifically, Apollo allows Palantir to cater towards an infinite number of clients, all whilst relying upon the same computational requirements, an encouraging factor when one is bullish Palantir&#8217;s future.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F321b007a-09c6-49df-a259-52b8d16cab78_700x518.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F321b007a-09c6-49df-a259-52b8d16cab78_700x518.png" width="700" height="518" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/321b007a-09c6-49df-a259-52b8d16cab78_700x518.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:518,&quot;width&quot;:700,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F321b007a-09c6-49df-a259-52b8d16cab78_700x518.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F321b007a-09c6-49df-a259-52b8d16cab78_700x518.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F321b007a-09c6-49df-a259-52b8d16cab78_700x518.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F321b007a-09c6-49df-a259-52b8d16cab78_700x518.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Fleet Dashboard <a href="https://blog.palantir.com/palantir-apollo-powering-saas-where-no-saas-has-gone-before-7be3e565c379">[25]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>All of these factors considered, giant corporations that have traditionally been against SaaS, were enticed to give Foundry or Gotham a gander based upon the aforementioned functionality. With the pandemic inducing business happenings of an urgent nature, Apollo was the functionality that allowed Palantir to cater these clients needs with ease.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A side note, Palantir is one of the handful of a series of companies (includes the likes of Amazon, Microsoft etc.) that has been authorized to be utilized for Mission Control National Security by the United States DoD <a href="https://www.palantir.com/platforms/apollo/">[26]</a>, a testament to the functionality of Apollo to say the least. </p><div><hr></div><p><strong>5.0 Business Intricacies&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Palantir primarily drives revenue by passing clients through their unique, three-stage sales cycle. Each stage, though occasionally unpredictable and sporadic, are essential to generating long-term value and have an essential role to play in both customer growth and retention.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Acquire Phase</strong>: </em>Palantir offers access to their platform to their customers, many a time for very low or no cost at all. This acts as a primer of sorts, providing an opportunity for the clients to gauge the effectiveness of the software, and allowing for Palantir to evaluate the intricacies and needs of the customer. By educating entities of the technical capabilities of Foundry or Gotham, Palantir aims to then move the corporations into later sales stages. Any customer that is classified under this section is realizing less than $100k generated within the LTM and are contained within accounts that operate at a loss <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001321655/97b89af1-0ad9-4daf-a411-6ca576744e7e.pdf">[27]</a>. </p><p><em><strong>Expand Phase:</strong> </em>This phase contains efforts made by Palantir directed at bettering their understanding of the exact issues that are commonplace within their client&#8217;s business. Clients within this sales stage may generate more than $100k in revenue, however they have poor associated unit economics, more specifically, contribution margin. This metric can be defined as the margin associated with the revenue generated by the unit, less the associated unit variable loss. This essentially means that we are considering only the revenue generated by the software and the costs associated with generating said revenue <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001321655/97b89af1-0ad9-4daf-a411-6ca576744e7e.pdf">[28]</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Scale Phase: </strong></em>This is the part of the sales cycle where unit economics start to become stellar; costs usually decrease, allowing contribution margin to enter into positive territory while the client generates more than $100k in revenue. Improvements are attributable to the fact that clients are usually versed by this stage, able to develop apps on top of or that coincide with Palantir&#8217;s software, engage in high-functioning ERP analysis and more. At this stage, Palantir aims to have sunk their teeth enough into the client so that 1) they become a continuous source of operational + management fees and 2) the cost of turning back and trying to develop in-house alternatives to Palantir is providing would be astronomical and not feasible. This last phase is both where the company starts to recognize material revenue, but also where they sign the dotted line on a potential long term source of prosperous ROI <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001321655/97b89af1-0ad9-4daf-a411-6ca576744e7e.pdf">[29]</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It should also be noted that these sales cycles are long-form, i.e. a time commitment ranging anywhere from three quarters of or the entire year, respectively.

Palantir&#8217;s software, whether it be Foundry or Gotham, has an inherent stickiness to it that is very unique. As more applications, AI/ML models, etc. get built within Palantir&#8217;s ecosystem, it becomes harder and harder to leave this functionality behind, or attempt to build the same solutions in-house. This hypothesis is validated when looking at the ACD (Average Contract Duration) associated with the company&#8217;s clients. At the end of Q2, ACD was recorded as 3.9 years, up from 3.7 years last quarter [20].&nbsp;</p><p>Of undoubtable importance to the influx of Revenue are Palantir&#8217;s Total Contract Value Booked (i.e. the amount of potential revenue that could be recognized based upon Palantir&#8217;s addition of new contracts made in Q2&#8217;21) as well as the remaining deal value (i.e. the total amount of revenue that Palantir has yet to realize from all of their contracts combined). Both of these values increased on a YoY Basis, as outlined below, and are indicative of a continuation of Palantir&#8217;s Revenue improvements going forwards. </p><div

Revenue attributable to clients within the United States and the Rest of the World increased, whereas Revenue within the United Kingdom and France decreased. Although there is evident Geographic concentration risk in Palantir&#8217;s Revenue, it is understandable when one takes into consideration the amount of clients, particularly in the US, that were scrambling towards Palantir&#8217;s software as the pandemic-induced headwinds spread. When coupled with the Revenue concentration within the Top 20 clients, it is evident that Palantir will need to maintain good relationships with their existing clients in order to clip their tail. On a positive note, Palantir&#8217;s total number of customers (TTM ended Q2&#8217;21) was 169, with the company adding 20 new customers. This concentration, when viewed alongside the magnitude of the spend of the US Army and other associated entities, is understandable but should definitely be monitored by investors going forwards. </p><p><em>Cost of Revenue:&nbsp;</em></p><p>The change in the Company&#8217;s Cost of Revenue over the course of the last few quarters can be seen outlined below:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2170d85b-a898-4234-8e00-a8b7cf9a04f1_1352x719.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2170d85b-a898-4234-8e00-a8b7cf9a04f1_1352x719.png" width="1352" height="719" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2170d85b-a898-4234-8e00-a8b7cf9a04f1_1352x719.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:719,&quot;width&quot;:1352,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2170d85b-a898-4234-8e00-a8b7cf9a04f1_1352x719.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2170d85b-a898-4234-8e00-a8b7cf9a04f1_1352x719.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2170d85b-a898-4234-8e00-a8b7cf9a04f1_1352x719.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2170d85b-a898-4234-8e00-a8b7cf9a04f1_1352x719.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Change in Quarterly COR - Koyfin</figcaption></figure></div><p>The company&#8217;s COR includes costs such as SBC (stock based compensation), salaries, and third party hosting services. The 33% YoY increase in this value, from $68.41M to $90.93M, is attributable to an increase in personnel costs of ~$9.5M (primarily SBC and payroll expenses), an $8.1M in third-party cloud hosting services and $4.5M in direct deployment costs. The hosting service, payroll expense and direct deployment costs are understandable increases in costs that occur as a result of business expansion and proportional revenue growth, however SBC expenses are very high, which is something investors will have to stomach going forwards.

Like most of their software company counterparts, these values are likely to stay very high in the near future. Net Income, EBITDA and EBIT Margins were almost identical, attributable to the fact that non-operating costs are negligible in magnitude, settling in within the (37)-(39)% range. These margins are unlikely to improve in the near future as long as SBC remains high.&nbsp;</p><p>Another important metric to examine is the Contribution Margin. This value essentially measures Palantir&#8217;s ability to successfully generate Revenue, less the costs associated with generating said Revenue (COR and S&amp;M less SBC). As customers go through the various stages of Sales Cycle, their contribution margins improve, thus this metric allows for investors to evaluate the efficiency so to speak of the entire sales process. The YoY and QoQ change in this value can be seen outlined below. Although this value improved on a YoY basis, it slightly decreased on a QoQ basis. This decrease should not be read too much into and is bound to improve as new and existing customers continue to make their way through Palantir&#8217;s sales process and find themselves subject to the power and stickiness of their products in general.   </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3010a42-2661-40ba-93c2-56e510b422cd_644x91.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3010a42-2661-40ba-93c2-56e510b422cd_644x91.png" width="644" height="91" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d3010a42-2661-40ba-93c2-56e510b422cd_644x91.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:91,&quot;width&quot;:644,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:6054,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3010a42-2661-40ba-93c2-56e510b422cd_644x91.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3010a42-2661-40ba-93c2-56e510b422cd_644x91.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3010a42-2661-40ba-93c2-56e510b422cd_644x91.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3010a42-2661-40ba-93c2-56e510b422cd_644x91.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">YoY Change in Contribution Margin</figcaption></figure></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a3b8c2a-4322-4f97-854a-d1c516423929_651x85.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a3b8c2a-4322-4f97-854a-d1c516423929_651x85.png" width="651" height="85" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7a3b8c2a-4322-4f97-854a-d1c516423929_651x85.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:85,&quot;width&quot;:651,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:6121,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a3b8c2a-4322-4f97-854a-d1c516423929_651x85.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a3b8c2a-4322-4f97-854a-d1c516423929_651x85.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a3b8c2a-4322-4f97-854a-d1c516423929_651x85.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a3b8c2a-4322-4f97-854a-d1c516423929_651x85.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">QoQ Change in Contribution Margin</figcaption></figure></div><p>In order to gauge the profitability of Palantir as a whole, we will look at the GAAP Measure (Net Income) and non-GAAP measure (EBITDA).&nbsp;

Either the company nets a nice profit from a potentially successful investment, or, Foundry becomes better as a result of feedback from use-cases in unique situations.

The company&#8217;s recognition of an increasingly complex world, and the potential negative looming events that come with it, is something I am a big fan of. In the case of an environment with high interest rates, Gold should generate a decent ROI and at the very worst (i.e. other macroeconomic conditions), would act as a store of value / alternative asset holding on the company&#8217;s balance sheet.</p><p>Palantir&#8217;s optionality has to be one of the most important factors to remember when analyzing this company. More specifically, it&#8217;s functionality, ranging from data aggregation and analytics to AI/ML deployment, capitalize on some of the most exciting trends that an investor can aim to have exposure to going forwards.&nbsp; Delving deeper, the most important development, in my opinion, are Palantir&#8217;s capabilities with regards to the Edge. Through the inherent functionality of Apollo, and more specifically, Apollo for Edge AI, Palantir is able to offer computational capabilities that would have otherwise required intermediaries had they not developed Edge AI capabilities themselves. Glossing over most of the technical specifics, there are innumerable applications where these capabilities can be applied to.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a33de14-3f46-4fd4-9c8e-9e94bef2323d_1403x893.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a33de14-3f46-4fd4-9c8e-9e94bef2323d_1403x893.png" width="1403" height="893" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8a33de14-3f46-4fd4-9c8e-9e94bef2323d_1403x893.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:893,&quot;width&quot;:1403,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a33de14-3f46-4fd4-9c8e-9e94bef2323d_1403x893.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a33de14-3f46-4fd4-9c8e-9e94bef2323d_1403x893.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a33de14-3f46-4fd4-9c8e-9e94bef2323d_1403x893.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a33de14-3f46-4fd4-9c8e-9e94bef2323d_1403x893.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Edge AI Palantir Homepage <a href="https://www.palantir.com/edge-ai/">[37]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>A powerful use-case was illustrated within Palantir&#8217;s most recent investor&#8217;s conference call, i.e. the company&#8217;s meta-constellation software. This software integrates itself with existing satellites, connecting hundreds of orbital sensors and AI models in order to perform some extremely sensitive and important analysis on problems ranging from crop yields to wildfires. This has also been applied to submarine analysis, leveraged by the US and allies. Palantir&#8217;s Edge AI connects with satellite subsystems, integrates AI models with the existing hardware and allows for the rapid reconfigurement of satellites to occur dependent on informational needs by constantly swapping micro AI models back into the system.&nbsp; The capabilities don&#8217;t stop there, when one thinks about the direction our world is going, Edge AI can be applied to Energy Management, Drug Compound Design Analysis, and an ever-developing IoT (Internet of Things) infrastructure. Some of the world&#8217;s most prevalent engineering problems, such as Autonomous Driving can and most likely will be solved with Edge AI. Palantir&#8217;s software can be applied to vehicle sensors and Edge AI can then be used to detect potential obstacles in the path of the moving vehicle, allowing for seamless FSD <a href="https://www.palantir.com/offerings/edge-ai/">[38]</a>. With the Edge Computing Market expected to be worth $61.14B by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 38.4% in between the 2021-2028 forecast period, these use-cases represent an undeniable value proposition <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-edge-computing-market#:~:text=The%20global%20edge%20computing%20market,expected%20to%20drive%20market%20growth">[39]</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, the company&#8217;s increased Sales Effort is a promising proposition for the company&#8217;s growth trajectory. In February of this year, Palantir and IBM partnered, allowing the company to expand their sales force while also allowing IBM to increase the ease-of-use associated with their software. This deal provides access to a sales team of more than 2,500, which is quite the increase from Palantir&#8217;s previous sales force, which only contained 30 individuals <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/palantir-teams-up-with-ibm-opening-path-to-expanded-sales-staff-1.1560543">[40]</a>. With Foundry still having a relatively low penetration within Fortune 500 companies and other large entities, it is very exciting to think about the doors that will be opened as a result of this partnership. When viewed in conjunction with Palantir&#8217;s unique sales cycle, of which Palantir decreases client risk associated with trying their software out, as well as the inherent stickiness of their products, exponential growth is not out of the question. </p><div><hr></div><p><strong>9.0 Risk Factors</strong></p><p>Palantir, is without a doubt, valued richly.

The fact that they are closely associated with Government and Military Entities, information surrounding their inner workings, specifically with Gotham, is often sparse due to security and confidentiality requirements. They are evidently subject to secondhand scrutiny with regards to the actions of the US military and their allies, particularly since their software is so intertwined with many of their operations. For better or worse, Palantir stands firm in their beliefs and values, as was made abundantly clear in the beginning of their S-1: </p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Our software is used to target terrorists and to keep soldiers safe. If we are going to ask someone to put themselves in harm&#8217;s way, we believe that we have a duty to give them what they need to do their job. We have chosen sides, and we know that our partners value our commitment. We stand by them when it is convenient, and when it is not.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Alex Karp, the controversial leader of Palantir, has also been ruthless with his description of his Silicon Valley counterparts, of which has caught some slack over the years. A prime example of this would be another hard-hitting quote from the company&#8217;s S-1 <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/palantir-teams-up-with-ibm-opening-path-to-expanded-sales-staff-1.1560543">[41]</a>: </p><blockquote><p>&#8220;The engineering elite of Silicon Valley may know more than most about building software,&#8221; Karp wrote. &#8220;But they do not know more about how society should be organized or what justice requires.

By casting a wide net on a booming TAM and offering some of the best-engineered products in the Big Data realm, Palantir, in my eyes, is poised to capitalize. This opportunity is not without its risks, and is bound to subject investors to some headaches regarding controversy, SBC and rich valuations. At the end of the day, as a shareholder of Palantir, I believe this risks are worth stomaching for the potential upside this company could see. </p><p>Thank you for reading my research. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2d8ac4c-a783-4cba-9610-616e6c75b66e_600x471.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2d8ac4c-a783-4cba-9610-616e6c75b66e_600x471.jpeg" width="600" height="471" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d2d8ac4c-a783-4cba-9610-616e6c75b66e_600x471.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:471,&quot;width&quot;:600,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;got more PLTR calls? - Dave Chappelle Junkie Y&amp;#39;all Got Anymore of | Make a  Meme&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="got more PLTR calls? - Dave Chappelle Junkie Y&amp;#39;all Got Anymore of | Make a  Meme" title="got more PLTR calls? - Dave Chappelle Junkie Y&amp;#39;all Got Anymore of | Make a  Meme" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2d8ac4c-a783-4cba-9610-616e6c75b66e_600x471.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2d8ac4c-a783-4cba-9610-616e6c75b66e_600x471.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2d8ac4c-a783-4cba-9610-616e6c75b66e_600x471.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2d8ac4c-a783-4cba-9610-616e6c75b66e_600x471.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Meme of the Day</figcaption></figure></div><p>If you enjoyed this research piece, please give it a like, comment below and share!

As such, there has been a proportional increase in the rate at which owners spend on high-quality products for their pets. A study performed by Advantage Solutions estimated that nearly three quarters of American Dog Owners were concerned with the origins of their pet&#8217;s food and treats, with an equally high percentage willing to spend more in order to maintain their pet&#8217;s health and longevity <a href="https://advantagesolutions.net/news/the-humanization-of-pets/">[5]</a>.

With demographic trends increasing the age at which individuals first start families, there is an increasing propensity for dogs to be treated as a first child so to speak, with spending habits corroborating these factors accordingly.   </p><p><em><strong>E-Commerce is here to stay:</strong> </em>In 2020, largely attributable to pandemic-induced acceleration, e-commerce sales in the United States reached a total of $212B <a href="https://www.petfoodindustry.com/blogs/7-adventures-in-pet-food/post/9838-pet-food-e-commerce-on-steroids-in-2020-and-beyond">[8]</a>.

one month supply of triple-enzymatic toothpaste, all of which are aimed at improving the oral hygiene and health of dogs.

In comparison to traditional and hard-to-implement dog dental hygiene procedures (i.e. trying to brush their teeth) the chew and toothpaste combo offered by Bark is a more enjoyable experience for both owner and pet, as outlined below: </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc69a0d4f-fad9-45e7-b6a3-0c52667dbfc4_958x571.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc69a0d4f-fad9-45e7-b6a3-0c52667dbfc4_958x571.png" width="958" height="571" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c69a0d4f-fad9-45e7-b6a3-0c52667dbfc4_958x571.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:571,&quot;width&quot;:958,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc69a0d4f-fad9-45e7-b6a3-0c52667dbfc4_958x571.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc69a0d4f-fad9-45e7-b6a3-0c52667dbfc4_958x571.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc69a0d4f-fad9-45e7-b6a3-0c52667dbfc4_958x571.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc69a0d4f-fad9-45e7-b6a3-0c52667dbfc4_958x571.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Bark Bright Three Stage Process <a href="https://www.barkbox.com/brightdental">[16]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p><em><strong>Bark Eats: </strong></em></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fded87587-dfac-408c-8263-328833010fec_859x442.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fded87587-dfac-408c-8263-328833010fec_859x442.png" width="859" height="442" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ded87587-dfac-408c-8263-328833010fec_859x442.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:442,&quot;width&quot;:859,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fded87587-dfac-408c-8263-328833010fec_859x442.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fded87587-dfac-408c-8263-328833010fec_859x442.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fded87587-dfac-408c-8263-328833010fec_859x442.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fded87587-dfac-408c-8263-328833010fec_859x442.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Bark Eats Homepage <a href="https://hello.barkeats.com/why-bark-eats">[17]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>This product offering is Bark&#8217;s attempt at making dog food as easy as possible.

Management attributes the strong and consistent growth, as exhibited above, to the addition of approximately 280,000 new subscriptions of which helped fuel the delivery of 3.6M shipments to the company&#8217;s sub base that is now ~1.9M in size, and growing <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001819574/712f416a-e055-4c2e-af43-5538b3c9adba.pdf">[21]</a>.&nbsp; Commerce Revenues on the other hand, though the smaller cohort of Total Revenues, grew noticeably as well, increasing by 58.7% on a YoY basis, at $12.2M. The growth in these values was attributable to increased activity at retail partners (Costco, Amazon etc.) as well as activity with new partners such as Lowes <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4447543-original-bark-company-bark-ceo-manish-joneja-on-q1-2022-results-earnings-call-transcript">[22]</a>. This retail activity is positive, and negates some of the dip in subscription-based purchasing activities that is bound to occur as individuals interact with brick and mortar locations at an increased rate due to re-openings etc. Another metric to consider is the growth of the Average Order Value (AOV), these values increased on a YoY basis by $0.87. Not a huge increase by any means, however it shows Bark&#8217;s ability to retain customers while also maintaining pricing, as well the versatility of Bark Play (Bark Bright, Eats and Home aren&#8217;t as significant sources of revenues).

When coupled with the heightened shipping costs seen across the US as well as the expansionary efforts the company is embarking on in order to expand their Bark Eats and Bark Bright offerings, it is understandable why G&amp;A contribution grew. These values should remain skewed for the remainder of the year given shipping challenge headwinds. S&amp;M expenses, though lessening their contribution to total OPEX, were skewed due to a YoY increase in CAC (Customer Acquisition Costs) of ~57%. Although some analysts may find this troublesome, if you take a second to digest the fact that comps from last year were heavily damped due to pandemic-induced pressures, this increase doesn&#8217;t appear to be too troublesome. Bark is still a relatively new business that is attempting to optimize their marketing funnels, thus patience is warranted in order to let the company iron out their kinks. When coupled with Bark&#8217;s continuous efforts to maintain a relationship with their customers, the LTV (long-term-value) of subscriptions and repeat purchasing habits greatly overshadows upfront CACs <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4447543-original-bark-company-bark-ceo-manish-joneja-on-q1-2022-results-earnings-call-transcript">[23]</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Profitability and Margins:&nbsp;</em></p><p>The company&#8217;s Gross Profit, EBITDA, EBIT and Net Income Margins, and their change with respect to previous quarters, can be seen outlined by the following: </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9316bbf3-bc76-4389-b04d-1d2fa8f6234f_1509x712.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9316bbf3-bc76-4389-b04d-1d2fa8f6234f_1509x712.png" width="1456" height="687" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9316bbf3-bc76-4389-b04d-1d2fa8f6234f_1509x712.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:687,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9316bbf3-bc76-4389-b04d-1d2fa8f6234f_1509x712.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9316bbf3-bc76-4389-b04d-1d2fa8f6234f_1509x712.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9316bbf3-bc76-4389-b04d-1d2fa8f6234f_1509x712.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9316bbf3-bc76-4389-b04d-1d2fa8f6234f_1509x712.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Changes in Margins -

Koyfin</figcaption></figure></div><p>The company&#8217;s gross margins are testament to the vertically integrated nature of Bark as a company. The fact that they have a loyal subscriber base with a low turnover rate, as well as the fact that their products are manufactured and distributed in-house, will be a driver of continued gross margin health going forward. Although the company has high gross margins, margins that took into consideration COGS as well as shipping the products to the customer would be in the low 50% range assuming a $5-$6 fulfillment cost. Though still high, this paints a better picture, in my opinion of the margins associated with just selling the product and without other Operating Expenses considered. On a EBITDA and EBIT Margin basis and Net Income basis, coming in at (9.2)% and (9.91)% and (21.09)% for the quarter respectively, as well as judging by the company&#8217;s EBITDA of  $(10.82)M and Net Income of $(24.8)M, it is evident that Bark is not profitable. This phenomena is attributable to the fact that the Bark, very clearly, has stated that they are amidst an investment year. The company has been able, in the past, to generate profitability (as seen in 2020) with diligent expense-control procedures. Being that as it may, management has stated that they are focused on growing their Bright and Eats product categories, which requires a proportional increase in staffing and technological investments as a result. If all goes well, Bark will be able to scale their operations at the expense of margins for the next few quarters, of which, in an idealized scenario, could be a significant source of growth in the future.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Balance Sheet:&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p>The structure of Bark&#8217;s Assets can be seen outlined by the following table: </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10e33b23-179e-4dc5-b623-71ce0624eb82_639x138.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10e33b23-179e-4dc5-b623-71ce0624eb82_639x138.png" width="639" height="138" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/10e33b23-179e-4dc5-b623-71ce0624eb82_639x138.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:138,&quot;width&quot;:639,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:9266,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10e33b23-179e-4dc5-b623-71ce0624eb82_639x138.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10e33b23-179e-4dc5-b623-71ce0624eb82_639x138.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10e33b23-179e-4dc5-b623-71ce0624eb82_639x138.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10e33b23-179e-4dc5-b623-71ce0624eb82_639x138.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Bark&#8217;s Asset Position</figcaption></figure></div><p>Bark has a very liquid asset position, consisting primarily of Cash and Cash Equivalents, followed by a reasonable Inventory Position.

Despite the fact that many may tout the benefit of being FCF positive, I believe Bark, when one takes into consideration the use of these cash flows (i.e. in scaling and improving their business) is right where they need to be. If all goes well, the betterment of high-margin business offerings that will generate meaningful revenues will be worth quarters of incurred negative FCF.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>6.0 Guidance&nbsp;</strong></p><p>For the upcoming Q2 FY&#8217;22 and for FY&#8217;22 as a whole, the company anticipates Total Revenue of $122M and Total Revenue of $516M, respectively. Despite giving no further guidance, the affirmation of values stated within previous quarters is testament to the positive outlook management has on their ability to maintain strong operations will also stamping out headwind pressures.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>7.0 Positive Developments&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The first point I would like to touch on is Bark&#8217;s valuation. With their Enterprise Value of ~$980M, their EV is approximately 2.3x LTM Revenues, 2.1x their Total Asset Position and 3.92x their LTM Gross Profit. Although Bark is not as profitable as its peers, judging by where it is at relative to its growth trajectory as well as the consistent compression of EV occurring due to poor price action, there is a lot to like about the R/R at the moment. </p><p>Another positive factor that I think is imperative to the continued overall success of Bark as a company is their social media presence. Arguably one of their strongest assets, Bark operates a series of Instagram accounts, a description of which can be seen outlined in the tables and images below <a

In a world where the humanization of pets is going nowhere, as well as the fact that current dog food offerings are fragmented and oftentimes generalized (there are organic and natural food products but fine-tuned customization is hard to come across), I am optimistic on the value proposition of Eats. Management was adamant, within the Q2 FY&#8217;22 earnings conference call, that the AOV of the purchases associated with this offering are almost double that of a typical BarkBox treat/toy-based order, which when coupled with the company&#8217;s consistently high-margins, is something to be excited about.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, another factor to consider is the misconceptions regarding the company&#8217;s churn rate. A lot of analysts, within their bear theses, have misdefined this metric and thus overstated the rate at which Bark is losing subscription customers. If management defines churn rate as the number of individuals that received a shipment during the 364 day period preceding the quarter, then the company would have a churn of 2.5% or retention rate of 97.5% <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4447543-original-bark-company-bark-ceo-manish-joneja-on-q1-2022-results-earnings-call-transcript">[28]</a>.&nbsp; Bark Bright in conjunction with Bark Eats, in my opinion will help keep this value very low once they scale, especially judging by the higher recurring nature of the need for dog food and other discretionary items in comparison to just toys and play-based offerings.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>8.0 Speculative Company Directions&nbsp;</strong></p><p>On a more speculative note, there is something to be said about the potential directions Bark could go with additional product offerings. The possible directions that I think are both the most plausible and the most appealing on a potential ROI basis are that of Pet Insurance referrals and Online Veterinary capabilities. Starting with Pet Insurance, IBIS World completed a study that estimated that the size of this US Market was approximately $1.7B, growing at a rate of 14.1% between 2016 and 2021 <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/market-research-reports/pet-insurance-industry/">[29]</a>. This fast-growing industry would most definitely be something Bark could venture into, not with Pet Insurance offerings per se, but more along the lines of leveraging a referral partnership. As an example, Trupanion, a leading Pet Insurance Provider, offers customers a referral payment, as outlined below: </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3a2b546-65b2-474e-a71f-acfd472f5840_881x735.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3a2b546-65b2-474e-a71f-acfd472f5840_881x735.png" width="881" height="735" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d3a2b546-65b2-474e-a71f-acfd472f5840_881x735.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:735,&quot;width&quot;:881,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3a2b546-65b2-474e-a71f-acfd472f5840_881x735.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3a2b546-65b2-474e-a71f-acfd472f5840_881x735.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3a2b546-65b2-474e-a71f-acfd472f5840_881x735.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3a2b546-65b2-474e-a71f-acfd472f5840_881x735.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Trupanion Homepage <a href="https://trupanion.com/canada/ec/refer-a-friend">[30]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Bark would be able to leverage their existing subscription base and generate significant revenue based off of referral fees alone. Most definitely a thought to ponder going forwards. An additional potential direction would be that of an Online Pet Pharmacy. Chewy, as an example, operates a PCAB accredited online platform that allows customers to easily fill prescriptions. The US Pet Medications Market generated $10.8B in sales throughout 2020, of which are increasingly garnered from online mediums. Regulatory abidance challenges aside, it is worth considering how Bark is dedicated to creating a frictionless and enjoyable dog-shopping experience, as well as the fact that pet pharmacies are primed for disruptions. represents another opportunity for Bark to create an all-encompassing pet subscription business.   </p><div><hr></div><p><strong>9.0 Risks&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A risk that I see Bark facing is maintaining adequate incentivization for customers to become a member of their various subscription services. Although their churn rate is low, which to me is indicative of high customer satisfaction and reasonably effective marketing efforts, the company may struggle with a continuation of US dog-market/pet-owner penetration with their current subscription models. Playing devil&#8217;s advocate, although the company&#8217;s subscription services are evidently convenient, there may be a missed opportunity when it comes to the perks of being a subscriber in conjunction with the Bark Shop for example. As an investor, I would like to see Bark offer subscribers potential discounts to accessories, be offered exclusive products or faster shipping times (when logistics/freight improvements are made) etc. I believe this could also be a huge boost to the efforts the company is making with their ATB functionality at increasing the rate at which new products can be scaled/introduced to the customer base. In summary, in my opinion, more perks = more reasons to become a subscriber. </p><p>Another risk to consider is how Bark gets viewed amongst its de-SPAC counterparts. As of August 17th, only 24% of the 106 SPAC companies that have completed their SPAC mergers this year are trading above their $10 IPO price <a href="https://twitter.com/SPACtrack/status/1427760505767202820">[31]</a>. Whether this is attributable to the increased bout of regulatory scrutiny or due to the fact that Retail Investors are finally starting to see past the projections that many of these companies EVs were based upon, is still up in the air. Needless to say, the price action in SPAC land has not been pleasant to say the least. Largely without reason, I believe Bark has been lumped in amongst its counterparts, and its stock may have fell victim to SPAC-related hesitancy, as outlined below: </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bded3d8-3136-43a2-961d-8e5b06b82ef7_857x573.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bded3d8-3136-43a2-961d-8e5b06b82ef7_857x573.png" width="857" height="573" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1bded3d8-3136-43a2-961d-8e5b06b82ef7_857x573.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:573,&quot;width&quot;:857,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:75848,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bded3d8-3136-43a2-961d-8e5b06b82ef7_857x573.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bded3d8-3136-43a2-961d-8e5b06b82ef7_857x573.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bded3d8-3136-43a2-961d-8e5b06b82ef7_857x573.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bded3d8-3136-43a2-961d-8e5b06b82ef7_857x573.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Bark 1 year Chart</figcaption></figure></div><p>Lastly, outside of the general macroeconomic headwinds and attempts at improving marketing efficiencies the company is dealing with, the largest risk the company is facing, in my opinion, is the general misunderstanding of Bark as a whole, especially amongst a series of skeptic analysts. Whether that be with comparisons between Bark and its competitors, false pretenses made about KPIs and how these are calculated or an underestimation of the potential of the subscription-based dog market, I believe many are missing out on this story. Although many investors might not like the conservative nature of the company, they have beaten revenue guidance during the last two quarters and I see no reason for this not to be the case going forwards. At the end of the day, I would much rather invest in a company that is reasonable with their estimates in comparison to one that leads on investors in order to manipulate/artificially inflate their stock price. </p><div><hr></div><p><strong>10.0 Conclusion </strong></p><p>Bark is a small and very speculative position for myself, one in which I believe presents an excellent risk to reward opportunity. Their unique products, reasonable valuation, great unit economics, headfast efforts made towards making both their operations and business better, and presence within an extremely resilient and anti-fragile market are the foundation of my thesis. Only time will tell if my assertions are corroborated or if a new influx of information proves me wrong, until then I am watching, contently, the progress that Bark is making. </p><p>Thank you for reading my analysis. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3bd61ef-34b0-4157-bf69-54da7b4f49dc_231x218.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3bd61ef-34b0-4157-bf69-54da7b4f49dc_231x218.jpeg" width="341" height="321.8095238095238" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e3bd61ef-34b0-4157-bf69-54da7b4f49dc_231x218.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:218,&quot;width&quot;:231,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:341,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Thank you for your time - Happy Dog Face | Meme Generator&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Thank you for your time - Happy Dog Face | Meme Generator" title="Thank you for your time - Happy Dog Face | Meme Generator" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3bd61ef-34b0-4157-bf69-54da7b4f49dc_231x218.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3bd61ef-34b0-4157-bf69-54da7b4f49dc_231x218.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3bd61ef-34b0-4157-bf69-54da7b4f49dc_231x218.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3bd61ef-34b0-4157-bf69-54da7b4f49dc_231x218.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Thank You! </figcaption></figure></div><p>If you enjoyed this research piece, please give it a like, comment below and share!

Continual and potential double-digit growth would result in proportional rise in Adjusted EBITDA likely to be in the ball park of Hundreds of Millions.   </p><p><em>Cost of Revenues:&nbsp;</em></p><p>The change in the company&#8217;s Cost of Revenues can be seen outlined in the following figure: </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18eea396-e621-45f5-8dff-5e436e19e4b4_1353x720.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18eea396-e621-45f5-8dff-5e436e19e4b4_1353x720.png" width="1353" height="720" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/18eea396-e621-45f5-8dff-5e436e19e4b4_1353x720.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:720,&quot;width&quot;:1353,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18eea396-e621-45f5-8dff-5e436e19e4b4_1353x720.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18eea396-e621-45f5-8dff-5e436e19e4b4_1353x720.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18eea396-e621-45f5-8dff-5e436e19e4b4_1353x720.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18eea396-e621-45f5-8dff-5e436e19e4b4_1353x720.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Change in Cost of Revenues</figcaption></figure></div><p>Increasing on a YoY basis, these values are not problematic, having increased proportionally to their Revenue counterparts. The largest concerns I had regarding Camping World&#8217;s CORs were related to supply chain constraints, the widespread material shortages and the increase in prices that usually coincides with these phenomena. Marcus Lemonis, in the Q2 earnings call was adamant on how the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) (Thor, Forest River and Winnebago) have focused on not significantly increasing the price of these RVs. When diligent cost controls are coupled with the 22% increase in new vehicle prices that Camping World implemented this quarter, it is hard not to forecast continual Revenue improvements going

The first item I would like to touch on is Electric World. This effort, first announced in the December of 2020, started off as a partnership between Camping World and Lordstown Motors, by where the companies would provide customers with all-electric RVs. In April of this year, this effort was moved further forward, with Camping World announcing that they will be establishing their first location in Draper, Utah <a href="https://www.rv.com/rv/trending-rvs/camping-world-announces-first-electric-world-location/#:~:text=last%20week%20announced%20it%20is,electric%20RVs%20by%20summer%202021">[6]</a>. Being that as it may, Lordstown has been subject to scrutiny as of late, from both shareholders and the SEC alike, for having an overstated order backlog and for insider trading activity occurring suspiciously close to a financial results announcement. As such, this partnership, by association, was not off to the best start. I was very content to see that in June, the companies decided to part ways, with Marcus Lemonis taking to Twitter and stating that the company planned on moving forward with Electric World without Lordstown Motors <a href="https://www.tribtoday.com/news/local-news/2021/06/camping-world-lmc-split/">[7]</a>. The company&#8217;s strategy revolving this new Business Vertical was elaborated upon further within the Q2 earnings conference call with Marcus making the following comments:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;We are not linked in the electrification. Our leadership and disruption in the electrification of the recreation space is not linked to any one company. It is going through our company and our ability to distribute through our 40 some odd states and our 187 locations and our e-commerce platforms, the products and services on the electrification side that make our company money and add value to the consumer.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>I am happy to see Camping World, even with this new endeavor, is focused on customers not the Electric RV manufacturers they may have to work with. With the electrification of vehicles starting to occur around the globe, there is no doubt in my mind that this will eventually be a large source of Revenue for the company, especially since the company will be able to leverage their existing infrastructure and locations across the US to deliver these products to customers.&nbsp;</p><p>Another positive development is how Camping World is leveraging their Good Sam RV Quote Valuator to deal with the demand for Used RVs.&nbsp;As previously mentioned and as outlined by the Used Vehicle Turnover Rate and the amount of Used Vehicle units sold, there has been quite the increase in Used Vehicle interest. Widespread shortages have gripped almost every industry, and has resulted in dealers not being able to find vehicles or satisfy customer demand. Camping World&#8217;s Good Sam RV Valuator Tool sets the company apart from its competitors, and helps them navigate these headwinds with ease.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15d2e5a9-6900-49a8-96db-7f8a7aee10cc_1025x447.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15d2e5a9-6900-49a8-96db-7f8a7aee10cc_1025x447.png" width="1025" height="447" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/15d2e5a9-6900-49a8-96db-7f8a7aee10cc_1025x447.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:447,&quot;width&quot;:1025,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15d2e5a9-6900-49a8-96db-7f8a7aee10cc_1025x447.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15d2e5a9-6900-49a8-96db-7f8a7aee10cc_1025x447.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15d2e5a9-6900-49a8-96db-7f8a7aee10cc_1025x447.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15d2e5a9-6900-49a8-96db-7f8a7aee10cc_1025x447.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Good Sam RV Quote Valuator Homepage <a href="https://www.goodsam.com/valueplus/">[8]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>This offering allows for Camping World to easily obtain Used RV inventory and provides an end-to-end service for customers looking to sell. As such, when coupled with the 100% YoY increase in Used Vehicle Inventory, Camping World will be able to meet customer demand while also ensuring they do not drain their stores going forward.&nbsp;</p><p>Another exciting development,&nbsp; in my opinion, is the company&#8217;s launch of its Peer to Peer (P2P) Rental Marketplace. This vertical, simply put, is a two-sided rental marketplace, allowing individuals to list their RVs on the platform and others to rent them in exchange for a fee. Camping World anticipates that customers will be able to fully interact with the marketplace in the fall, i.e. bookings and listings will be made available to all. Alongside the P2P platform, Camping World Holdings&#8217; sister company, the Good Sam Club will provide products and services alongside RV rentals.&nbsp; These will include rental protection, 24/7 roadsides support, as well as savings on both bookings and the service fees for club members. This offering is truly unique and will be a serious hit when coupled with dilligent marketing efforts in my opinion. Camping World has approximately 5.5M Active Customers and as such there is no shortage of individuals interacting with their platform. The P2P marketplace will be able to appeal to individuals that desire experiential travel, but do want to take the leap into owning an RV itself. Judging by the success of platforms such as AirBnB, of which are in the business of selling customers experiences, I believe this will be an enormous hit. Not only will P2P offer customers an opportunity to yield a return on their RV investment, but it will also allow Camping World to expand their customer base with individuals that would have otherwise stayed away and create another business offering that may provide lasting shareholder value. To put the potential of this opportunity into perspective, a competitor, Outdoorsy has been putting up some noticeable numbers, anticipating to reach $1B in sales this year. Camping World, which is a better business by almost every metric, will be able to scale their P2P rental service far beyond what Outdoorsy is able to, attributable to their Good Sam Club members. If the company were able to engage even 5% of their total member base within the P2P marketplace, this would generate noticeable EBITDA.   </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2665e203-6b79-49ea-88b6-f6f3c9055d26_1001x695.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2665e203-6b79-49ea-88b6-f6f3c9055d26_1001x695.png" width="1001" height="695" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2665e203-6b79-49ea-88b6-f6f3c9055d26_1001x695.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:695,&quot;width&quot;:1001,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2665e203-6b79-49ea-88b6-f6f3c9055d26_1001x695.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2665e203-6b79-49ea-88b6-f6f3c9055d26_1001x695.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2665e203-6b79-49ea-88b6-f6f3c9055d26_1001x695.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2665e203-6b79-49ea-88b6-f6f3c9055d26_1001x695.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Outdoorsy News Profile <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/outdoorsy-1-billion-in-sales-airbnb-hire-best-year-2021-1">[9]</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Camping World is also investing significantly in their service base. Currently there exists quite the disparity between the number of technicians and service stations and their total RVs in circulation counterpart <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4444434-camping-world-holdings-inc-cwh-ceo-marcus-lemonis-on-q2-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript">[10]</a>. As such, Camping World intends to build out more service locations as well as increase the number of technicians employed and their associated technical skillsets. Being that the service vertical contains products and offerings that are both high-churn and high-margin, this will undoubtedly be a driver of value in the coming quarters and years. This strategy also aligns with the improvements Camping World is trying to the retail-side of their operations. According to Marcus, the company will spend the next few years removing low-churn products from the store-floor, ensuring that even their retail locations are focused on generating meaningful and recurring conversions. Coupled with the fact that the company embarked on their strategic shift in 2019 showcases managements past and current focus on optimizing retail operations.&nbsp;</p><p>For the sake of brevity, I will not cover every minute business development that one should be excited about. However, I will impart this last point to ponder. Camping World Holdings, through the aforementioned developments and Good Sam product offerings, has developed itself into more than just an Outdoor Retail and RV company. They have added a layer of high-margin and recurring revenue on top of their already thriving operations, of which will continue to grow and set them apart. When compared with their competition, Camping World is truly in its own realm of capabilities, and I believe this will not stop being the case anytime soon. </p><div><hr></div><p><strong>4.0 Marcus Lemonis&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I have said this before and I will say it again, Marcus Lemonis is what an investor should dream of when thinking of a CEO. Wisdom imparted on me by Nassim Taleb, through the study of his works, has instilled a focus on the phenomenon of &#8220;Skin in The Game&#8221; within my investing process. More specifically, my investments are usually centered around good companies with management who directly align their success, financial and otherwise, with that of their companies. These traits can be exhibited through an executive&#8217;s personal stake in the company itself and compensation packages focused on long-term company success rather than short-term price action (sometimes encouraged with stock option packages). I believe Marcus has one of the highest skin in the game ratings for Executives of publicly traded companies today. This can be seen with his ridiculously low yearly salary, and his stock ownership (through ML ACQ), both outlined below: </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bb02df7-96b1-4427-8ae4-f2021ad7e3a2_577x113.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bb02df7-96b1-4427-8ae4-f2021ad7e3a2_577x113.png" width="577" height="113" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1bb02df7-96b1-4427-8ae4-f2021ad7e3a2_577x113.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:113,&quot;width&quot;:577,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bb02df7-96b1-4427-8ae4-f2021ad7e3a2_577x113.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bb02df7-96b1-4427-8ae4-f2021ad7e3a2_577x113.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bb02df7-96b1-4427-8ae4-f2021ad7e3a2_577x113.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bb02df7-96b1-4427-8ae4-f2021ad7e3a2_577x113.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Marcus Lemonis&#8217; Compensation <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001669779/f66ca378-2e7a-4792-8686-af01f222cb5e.pdf">[11]</a></figcaption></figure></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68de0147-1950-4437-b8a6-e5856c4c0f49_639x74.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68de0147-1950-4437-b8a6-e5856c4c0f49_639x74.png" width="639" height="74" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/68de0147-1950-4437-b8a6-e5856c4c0f49_639x74.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:74,&quot;width&quot;:639,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:4988,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68de0147-1950-4437-b8a6-e5856c4c0f49_639x74.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68de0147-1950-4437-b8a6-e5856c4c0f49_639x74.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68de0147-1950-4437-b8a6-e5856c4c0f49_639x74.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68de0147-1950-4437-b8a6-e5856c4c0f49_639x74.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Stock Ownership</figcaption></figure></div><p>With an enormous sum of the man&#8217;s own money is aligned with the success of Camping Word,  this is something that should help investors sleep well at night.
