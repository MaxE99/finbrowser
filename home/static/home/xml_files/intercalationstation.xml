In short, it acts as a weighed news aggregators which gives a score and a number of comments to energy-related news articles.

I will quickly go over each technology, in decreasing order of score (note: lithium-ion batteries were excluded from the analysis, as it is debatable to consider them "next-generation" since <strong><a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-storage">in 2020 they represented 93% of newly installed storage capacity</a></strong>):</p><div><hr></div><h3>Grid-scale hydrogen storage</h3><p>So, hydrogen seems to be capturing most of the headlines as the next go-to grid-scale storage technology (mobility applications were excluded from the search).</p><p>But not always in a good way: in "Hydrogen (against)" I counted articles openly criticizing hydrogen storage. Also, the ratio comment/score is much higher than for most other technologies, which would indicate a more intense debate surrounding hydrogen.</p><p>Among the support, we can find:</p><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.powermag.com/the-big-picture-hydrogen-power/">The "hydrogen economy".</a></strong> Hydrogen can be used in many applications: ammonia production for agriculture, direct iron ore reduction for the steel industry, mobility applications, seasonal grid-scale storage, etc...</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2021/3/26/renewable-energy-water-splitting/">Hydrogen can be produced in a carbon-neutral way from renewable sources</a></strong> through electrolysis or other methods.</p></li><li><p>When stored at high pressures, it exhibits high energy density as a fuel and can be stored for large amounts of time.</p></li></ul><p>Among the criticism, we can find:</p><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.rechargenews.com/energy-transition/hydrogen-in-the-home-would-be-four-times-more-dangerous-than-natural-gas-government-report/2-1-1047218">Concerns about the flammability of hydrogen</a></strong>. Beyond the possibility of accidents, this results in added safety and storage costs.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2021/12/22/0-03-of-hydrogen-is-green-hydrogen/">0.03% of hydrogen is actually "green"</a></strong>. To date, most hydrogen is produced through steam reforming of natural gas, which bears the question of the "grey price" (carbon emissions) of the technology, and which industries may benefit first from the hydrogen hype.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/liebreich-separating-hype-from-hydrogen-part-two-the-demand-side/">The demand may not follow the hype</a></strong>. The "hydrogen economy" idea rests on the assumption that hydrogen will be competitive with other technologies. What if it there are better alternatives in each separate application?</p></li></ul><p><strong>My two cents: </strong>I think "green" hydrogen should target the fertilizer and steel production markets, by far the largest. As far as grid-scale storage applications go, there might be better alternatives out there, especially in terms of round-trip efficiency.</p><div><hr></div><h3>&#128267; Flow batteries</h3><p>In short, these batteries store energy in large tanks of liquid electrolytes, pumping them into a porous electrode to enable the electrochemical reaction. Many combinations of electrolytes are possible, the most developed to date being the all-vanadium chemistry.</p><p>They present a range of advantages:</p><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2019/03/13/worlds-first-flow-battery-gets-10-years-of-performance-insurance/">Long theoretical lifetime</a></strong>, the reactions being more reversible than in solid-state electrodes like Li-ion.</p></li><li><p>Independent power/energy sizing, which makes them more suitable for long-duration storage applications (e.g 8-12h, Li-ion being limited to 4h)</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/its-big-and-longlived-and-it-wont-catch-fire-the-vanadium-redoxflow-battery">Non-flammability</a></strong>, due to the large volumes of water</p></li></ul><p>But also a few drawbacks:</p><ul><li><p>Low energy density</p></li><li><p>Expensive electrolytes</p></li><li><p>Higher maintenance costs than "black-box" systems</p></li></ul><p><strong><a href="https://www.powerengineeringint.com/energy-storage/latest-development-on-chinas-largest-battery-energy-storage-project/">Very large industrial projects</a></strong> have propelled the Vanadium flow battery to the industrial scale and demonstrated its viability in grid-scale storage applications. The main issue, namely the cost of the battery when compared to lithium-ion, will highly depend on the "learning curve" effect (broadly speaking, costs being divided by 10 when installed capacity is multiplied by 1000) and the supply chain of Vanadium.</p><p>In this regard, organic flow batteries (<strong><a href="https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/12/20/lockheed-martin-to-provide-flow-battery-for-103-mw-alberta-solar-storage-project/">with large companies such as Lockheed Martin developing the technology)</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/2019/05/cleanspark-completes-solar-microgrid-with-400-kwh-iron-flow-battery-at-camp-pendleton/">iron-flow batteries</a></strong> appear as a promising alternative, but it remains to be seen how much they can benefit from spillovers from Vanadium batteries in terms of system design and operation, and more importantly, if their electrolytes can be produced cheaply, at scale.</p><p><strong>My two cents: </strong>Flow batteries appear as a promising technology for peak-shaving and intra-day trading applications, complementary to Li-ion for frequency regulation. The big question mark relates to costs, the economy of scale and the right chemistry.</p><div><hr></div><h3>&#9832; Thermal storage</h3><p>In good correlation with the size of the biggest concentrated solar powerplants installed in Spain and the US, some of the most discussed articles on thermal storage relate to the <strong><a href="http://file///Users/mouo/Zotero/storage/JGVY62VZ/csp-concentrated-solar-molten-salt-storage-24-hour-renewable-energy-crescent-dunes-nevada.html">molten salt technology</a></strong>, which has reached industrial maturity and should see its cost decrease as it will undergoes the "learning curve" effect, with more projects being commissioned in <strong><a href="https://www.power-technology.com/marketdata/kalkaar-molten-salt-thermal-energy-storage-system-south-africa/">South Africa</a></strong> and Australia.</p><p>The remaining challenges include:</p><ul><li><p>Elucidating structure-property relationships for the <strong><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1674200114000571">formulation and fabrication of optimised composite materials</a></strong></p></li><li><p>Limiting <strong><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032119305362">high-temperature corrosion</a></strong></p></li></ul><p>The field of thermal storage features a wide diversity of technologies, however, including liquid air storage (LAES or <strong><a href="https://www.smart-energy.com/industry-sectors/storage/china-pilots-cryobattery-for-long-duration-energy-storage/">cryobatteries</a></strong>), where the air is cooled down during charge, stored in low-pressure tanks and expanded during discharge to drive a turbine. <strong><a href="https://www.rechargenews.com/transition/work-starts-to-build-worlds-first-commercial-liquid-air-energy-storage-plant/2-1-908259">UK-funded Projects</a></strong> should reach the demonstrator scale in 2023, giving a better overview of operating performance and economic viability of the concept.</p><p>Other solutions exist in the form of waste heat recovery and storage, which include:</p><ul><li><p>using <strong><a href="https://www.energy-storage.news/million-cubic-metre-90gwh-thermal-storage-project-in-finland-could-begin-construction-next-year/">water in large underground reservoirs below cities in Finland</a></strong> for seasonal heat storage</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.rechargenews.com/transition/why-a-low-cost-thermal-battery-could-become-the-swiss-army-knife-of-emissions-reductions/2-1-853168">composite concrete materials</a></strong> for mid-size systems</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04230-8">organic molecules</a></strong> for customer applications</p></li></ul><p><strong>My two cents: </strong>I think thermal storage will target the conversion heat-&gt;electricity rather than the two-way conversion electricity-&gt;heat-&gt;electricity, so in a way it should be regarded as a generation technology.</p><div><hr></div><h3>&#127754; Pumped hydro</h3><p>In 2018, pumped hydro accounted for <strong><a href="https://www.hydro.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-NHA-Pumped-Storage-Report.pdf">97% of storage capacity worldwide</a></strong>. It is therefore the most mature technology on the list, but also present the issue of requiring pretty specific geographic conditions, leading to little remaining growth potential in Europe.</p><p>T<strong><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266679082100241X">he closed-loop technology</a></strong> holds the advantage of not requiring specific geographic conditions, at the cost of <strong><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652617307515">higher engineering and installation costs</a></strong> due to the creation of the upper and lower reservoirs from scratch. Some possible solutions include <strong><a href="https://en.mexico.pueblosamerica.com/l/life/germany-coal-mine/">using old coal mines as reservoirs</a></strong>.</p><p><strong>My two cents:</strong> In a context of decentralisation of the energy sector towards microgrids, especially in developing economies, investors will favour smaller-scale storage systems with low investment costs. I am unsure how closed-loop hydro would perform in this context.</p><div><hr></div><h3>&#128267; Metal-air batteries</h3><p>Based on the same general principle as rusting (but in a reversible way), metal-air batteries target the market of long-duration storage (up to 150h) and use cheap active materials, the most common to date being <strong><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/12/lose-the-alkaline-keep-the-zinc-for-a-new-battery-chemistry/">zinc</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-9814873/Scientists-develop-iron-air-battery-stores-electricity-days.html">iron</a></strong>. The main selling point of metal-air batteries is their low predicted LCOS (between 20 and 45 $/kWh), although these costs haven't yet been demonstrated in large operating systems.</p><p>Furthermore, metal-air batteries <strong><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cplu.201402238">have a few challenges to overcome</a></strong>, including:</p><ul><li><p>developing more efficient and moderate-cost bifunctional oxygen positive electrodes.</p></li><li><p>using technologies that are readily scaled for manufacturing negative electrodes.</p></li><li><p>improving engineering in cell design and materials using cheap aqueous electrolytes and robust electrodes.</p></li></ul><p><strong>My two cents:</strong> Metal-air batteries seem to be a technology very well-suited for weekly/monthly storage, complementary to flow batteries for intra-day trading and Li-ion for frequency regulation. The costs announced, however, seem overly optimistic and should be taken with a grain of salt until large-scale demonstrator data is available.</p><div><hr></div><h3>&#128168; Compressed Air Energy Storage</h3><p>Next-generation compressed air technologies include <strong><a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/green-tech/a36300986/compressed-air-grid-energy-storage-system/">Advanced Compressed Air Energy Storage (A-CAES)</a></strong> systems which, similarly to the concept of closed-loop pumped hydro, can be built anywhere and don't require specific geographic conditions such as large underground salt caverns. <strong><a href="https://www.rechargenews.com/energy-transition/gigawatt-scale-compressed-air-world-s-largest-non-hydro-energy-storage-projects-announced/2-1-1003559">Gigawatt-scale projects</a></strong> have been announced in the US, which should allow assessing the economic viability of the technology once all installation and maintenance costs are factored in.</p><p><strong>My two cents:</strong> Same as pumped hydro.</p><div><hr></div><h3>&#129474; Sodium-ion batteries</h3><p>Sodium-ion batteries are very similar in design to their lithium-ion counterparts, which <strong><a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/features/a-battery-technology-worth-its-salt/3010966.article">allows spillovers in terms of cell design and manufacturing</a></strong>, while sodium is much more accessible and abundant than lithium. However, sodium batteries present their own challenges, including <strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.0c02181">typically lower energy density, higher costs and slower charging</a></strong>. Cost and performance projections will highly depend on the installed capacity in the years to come, with <strong><a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202106/1227249.shtml">major projects being commissioned in China</a></strong> and startups emerging in the <strong><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fenrg.2020.605129">UK, France and China</a></strong>.</p><p><strong>My two cents: </strong>The main challenge of Na-ion is to find an application where it outperforms Li-ion and emerging technologies. Otherwise, it may remain a worst alternative to Li-ion.</p><div><hr></div><h3>&#127756; Gravity storage (excluding pumped hydro)</h3><p>Currently, the main alternative to pumped hydro in the field of gravity storage is to lift heavy materials, either <strong><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/energy-vault-gravity-storage/">using cranes to stack concrete blocks above ground</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://gravitricity.com/">using shafts to bring weights up and down underground</a></strong>. In the former concept, the main concern appears to be:</p><ul><li><p>wind conditions leading to heavy mechanical constraints on the cranes, <strong><a href="https://www.edn.com/using-gravity-for-energy-storage-viable-idea-or-impractical/">rendering them either very expensive to manufacture or unsafe to operate</a></strong>.</p></li><li><p>Additionally, while the technology does not require specific geographic conditions on paper, it is hard to picture public acceptance of a concrete tower being perpetually under construction for decades.</p></li></ul><p>In the case of the latter concept, closed-loop pumped hydro seems more straightforward and proven technology, for the same engineering effort. These points may explain the unusually high ratio comments/score of these technologies on Reddit, as users of the forum debate the viability of the technology.</p><p><strong>My two cents: </strong>I really don't believe in the crane concept, and I am doubtful of the underground elevator concept.</p><div><hr></div><h3>&#128267; Liquid metal batteries</h3><p>Pioneered by the group of <strong><a href="https://news.mit.edu/2016/battery-molten-metals-0112">Donald R. Sadoway at MIT</a></strong>, liquid metal batteries (LMBs) are a kind of mix between thermal and electrochemical storage, where the <strong><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cr300205k">transfer of ions between two metals is separated by a molten salt electrolyte is facilitated at high temperatures</a></strong>. Advantages include:</p><ul><li><p>low-cost and abundant active materials</p></li><li><p>long cycle life</p></li><li><p>simple assembly</p></li></ul><p>Disadvantages, however, include:</p><ul><li><p>high operating temperature resulting in a loss in round-trip efficiency and <strong><a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/ee/d1ee00531f">potential parasitic reactions</a></strong></p></li><li><p>low energy and power density</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4038699">potential fluid mechanics phenomena hindering operation</a></strong></p></li></ul><p>High operating temperatures, in particular, can be an issue at the industrial scale (see sodium-sulfur batteries), so a compromise should be found between added costs and operational safety.</p><p><strong>My two cents:</strong> LMBs seem comparable to flow and metal-air batteries, and would target similar applications. While they may have a low floor in terms of cost, costs primarily go down due to the "learning curve" effect when more and more capacity is installed. The main issue to me is that the research community is much less active on LMBs, which makes me pessimistic about the future rate of improvement of the technology.</p><div><hr></div><h3>&#128168; <strong>CO2 batteries</strong></h3><p>Carbon dioxide making much of the headlines related to climate change, it is only natural that researchers would look into how to turn it into a directly usable material after capture.</p><p>Lithium-carbon dioxide batteries were first developed as a <strong><a href="https://newatlas.com/lithium-carbon-dioxide-capture-battery/56465/">proof-of-concept at MIT</a></strong>, showing that the technology <strong><a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/abstract/S2542-4351(18)30405-7">opens up a possible route to combine CO2 capture and electrochemical conversion in a single device</a></strong>. The technology, despite showing promises at the lab scale is still in its infancy, as shown by the low exposure on Reddit.</p><p><strong>My two cents: </strong>If the process can be tuned to improve the synthesis of carbon-based materials from CO2 capture, I could see the potential. As far as batteries go, it seems much more straightforward to use lithium for Li-ion batteries.</p><div><hr></div><h3>&#128267; Sodium-sulfur batteries</h3><p>In a somewhat similar fashion as liquid metal batteries, sodium-sulfur batteries make use of molten sodium and sulfur at high temperatures to produce power. While a great deal of research in <strong><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1744-7402.2004.tb00179.x">the early 2000s</a></strong> led to fast scaling-up of the technology and commercial applications, technical difficulties such as corrosion, high operation cost and more importantly <strong><a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/exploding-sodium-sulfur-batteries-from-ngk-energy-storage">accidents in Japan in 2011 leading to explosions</a></strong> slowed down investments and press coverage of the technology.</p><p><strong>My two cents: </strong>Improvements in battery design regarding <strong><a href="https://www.ngk-insulators.com/en/">safety</a></strong> and efforts on <strong><a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2020/ee/d0ee02203a">lowering the operating temperature</a></strong> may revitalise the technology, but it is unsure how it will compete with emerging battery chemistries in the near future.</p><div><hr></div><p>As for lead-acid batteries and flywheels, these are tried and tested technologies, which are well implanted in their respective markets and are not subject to much press coverage, but it is unlikely that they will be significantly challenged in the short term.</p><p>I hope you enjoyed reading the post, which is part of the first chapter of my PhD thesis "Modelling and simulation of organic redox-flow batteries".

In a move that is apparently normal for metals producers, Xiang is hedging against the risk of falling nickel prices &#8212; a metal whose rising price otherwise benefits Xiang as a producer &#8212; by <a href="https://www.mining.com/web/trader-known-as-big-shot-battles-mystery-nickel-stockpiler/">holding short positions against it on the LME</a>. Essentially, Xiang is betting that the price of nickel will decrease, which isn&#8217;t such a terrible idea when you consider that Xiang and Tsingshan were able to <a href="https://www.mining.com/nickel-price-drops-most-since-2016-after-tsingshan-deal/">lower the price of nickel just a year ago</a> by boosting output of a key precursor in Indonesia.</p><p>On Monday, a bunch of margin calls were due on Xiang&#8217;s short positions, meaning he had to pony up hundreds of millions of dollars just to keep his short positions going. At the same time though, Western sanctions placed on Russian exports have created fears of a nickel shortage. Norilsk Nickel, a Russian nickel supplier, is responsible for 15% to 20% of global battery-grade nickel.</p><p>While exports of Norilsk&#8217;s nickel haven&#8217;t been banned (yet), <a href="https://www.mining.com/web/russian-metal-exports-slide-as-sanctions-hit-commodity-financing/">many Western buyers have already halted purchases</a>. This fear has driven nickel prices up, making Xiang&#8217;s margin calls even costlier. <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/commodities/article/3169775/chinese-tycoon-xiang-guangda-behind-big-nickel-short-facing">Xiang ultimately decided to close out a portion of his increasingly untenable short positions</a> by buying back a bunch of nickel contracts yesterday <a href="https://www.mining.com/lme-cancels-nickel-trading-after-price-soars-past-100000-a-tonne/">at a staggering loss</a>.

This includes applications like long-range electric vehicles (&gt;500km) and high power applications like eVTOLs. </p><p>Commercial lithium-ion batteries based on graphite anodes are hitting a plateau that limits performance. Lithium metal is seen as (one of the) holy grails for higher energy anode materials to replace graphite (lithium is the lightest metal in the periodic table with a theoretical capacity of 3862 mAh/g), and end-users are developing lithium metal technologies to push cell performance. At a cell level, there is academic research and startups working with energy density upwards of 500 Wh/kg and 1000 Wh/L!</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd5083b7-907d-4817-914e-94a655d53997_882x612.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd5083b7-907d-4817-914e-94a655d53997_882x612.png" width="590" height="409.38775510204084" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fd5083b7-907d-4817-914e-94a655d53997_882x612.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:612,&quot;width&quot;:882,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:590,&quot;bytes&quot;:97751,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd5083b7-907d-4817-914e-94a655d53997_882x612.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd5083b7-907d-4817-914e-94a655d53997_882x612.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd5083b7-907d-4817-914e-94a655d53997_882x612.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd5083b7-907d-4817-914e-94a655d53997_882x612.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Source: Advanced Propulsion Centre UK</figcaption></figure></div><p>However, there are key challenges associated with incorporating a lithium metal anode.</p><ul><li><p>Perhaps the main challenge: uneven lithium deposition can lead to dendrite growth, resulting in  internal shorts of the battery.

Cuberg batteries combine a lithium metal anode with a proprietary liquid electrolyte that suppresses dendrite formation and ensures uniform lithium plating which enables high energy density and high power capability. The company has expertise in building lithium metal batteries and delivering cells to 20+ customers. In addition, Cuberg was recently acquired by Northvolt and is able to leverage scale production capabilities and deep experience in battery recycling. To date, Cuberg&#8217;s efforts have been focused on the aviation industry and enabling electrification in an industry that has struggled to do so in the past. Through 2021, Cuberg has made large advancements in chemistry development as well as optimizing cell formats for various aviation customers, helping make the electrification of the aviation sector more of a reality.</p><p><strong>Relevant reading/watching</strong></p><ul><li><p>Advanced Science. <a href="http://Confronting the Challenges in Lithium Anodes for Lithium Metal Batteries">Confronting the Challenges in Lithium Anodes for Lithium Metal Batteries</a></p></li><li><p>Journal of Energy Chemistry. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2095495620300012">Lithium metal anodes: Present and future</a>.</p></li><li><p>CNBC. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJ1etjdsZAg&amp;ab_channel=CNBC">Why This Battery Breakthrough Could Make EVs Cheaper.</a></p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2>&#128267; Battery Chats: Richard Wang, Co-Founder &amp; CEO at Cuberg</h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65b59c39-1740-47b4-a162-c7b8279df288_554x736.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65b59c39-1740-47b4-a162-c7b8279df288_554x736.png" width="274" height="364.014440433213" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/65b59c39-1740-47b4-a162-c7b8279df288_554x736.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:736,&quot;width&quot;:554,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:274,&quot;bytes&quot;:515301,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65b59c39-1740-47b4-a162-c7b8279df288_554x736.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65b59c39-1740-47b4-a162-c7b8279df288_554x736.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65b59c39-1740-47b4-a162-c7b8279df288_554x736.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65b59c39-1740-47b4-a162-c7b8279df288_554x736.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Cuberg is commercializing next-generation battery technology to power the future of electric mobility. The company was acquired in 2021 by Northvolt, a global supplier of sustainable, high-quality battery cells and systems. As Northvolt's Advanced Technology Center operating in Silicon Valley, Cuberg is developing and commercializing lithium metal batteries, building an innovation ecosystem around lithium-ion technology, and leveraging Northvolt's state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities to rapidly scale up production of advanced batteries. The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.</p><p><strong>Intercalation</strong>: Great to chat with you! Can you give a rundown of what you&#8217;ve been doing for the last few years?</p><blockquote><p><strong>Richard</strong>: We're developing a lithium metal cell technology based on a liquid electrolyte. It spun out of my Stanford 2016 PhD work and our thesis is how do you make next-generation technology work with maximum scalability and compatibility on infrastructure? </p><p>At the end of the day, lithium-ion batteries have progressed so far that anything that requires rethinking or reimagining of what that looks like is not going to work. Even if it works at a product and technology level, it's not going to scale fast enough to make a real difference in the climate crisis. If we want next-gen technologies to actually do something big, you have to start transitioning to extreme technologies as fast as possible and the only way to do this is by piggybacking on all the existing momentum to build out gigafactories this decade. That's why we're focused on liquid electrolytes in a way that's relatively uncommon. Other than <a href="https://intercalationstation.substack.com/p/ses-battery-world">SES</a>, there's nobody else working on it in a really prominent way. </p><p>With Northvolt, we have an exciting opportunity. We're not directly going to the automotive industry which is ruthless when it comes to costs and a relatively commoditized industry. Aviation, on the other hand, has a much higher value proposition for next-generation technology and a better fit for early commercialization.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Intercalation</strong>: I remember Cuberg was part of the Boeing accelerator many years ago. Is that kind of the accelerator that shaped you towards moving towards the aviation industry?</p><blockquote><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Boeing invested in us back in 2018 and sparked a good amount of interest in the aviation space. It was a mutual interest, we were already interested in exploring aviation. Through Boeing, we got a lot more traction and visibility in the aviation industry as well. We've been working on it for more than three years at this point.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Intercalation</strong>: Cuberg has been on such a journey! How has it been since you first started as a fresh spinout? And then you got your first round of funding, what were the big changes from pre-funding to funding? And then going forward, what were the key changes going from being a private company to being acquired by Northvolt? </p><blockquote><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Before the acquisition, we had built a good foundation of customer attraction in the aviation industry and we were shipping cell samples to companies in the space. But the maturity was still low, not where we wanted it. We were still a small startup. We didn't have a longer-term plan, resources and expertise to back up that we could ultimately become a trusted supplier in the aviation industry. </p><p>With Northvolt, it really changed the dynamic. Northvolt has tremendous manufacturing as well as financial resources and have committed to making lithium metal batteries work in aviation and eventually in automotive. We've seen a tremendous shift in terms of how the industry perceives us. At the end of the day, they're already building out tremendous gigafactory capacity around the world. It isn't much of a stretch to say that we could deploy our technology and become a large credible supplier.</p><p>We're able to leverage the scale that Northvolt has. If you&#8217;re a startup and you've never done manufacturing, you can now do it for the first time. Jumping to a gigafactory scale as a first move is a very risky move, whereas we're more cautious. We're tackling aviation and we have all the manufacturing resources. That's helped us to mature our product, our process, and our production capacity much faster.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Intercalation</strong>: How has your role changed as CEO? I imagined it was completely different pre and post-acquisition.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Richard</strong>: I don't need to do fundraising anymore! That's pretty nice. Northvolt has lots of resources so they've done this internally for the most part. </p><p>Beyond that, I spend a lot more time engaging internally and see how can Cuberg can leverage the broader resources in terms of expertise, particularly engineering expertise around scale. We've also built out a technology scouting responsibility seeing what are the next exciting startups coming down the pipeline and working with them at an early stage, before integrating them into the normal sort of portfolio of technologies that they want to fly.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Intercalation</strong>: Going back to your comment about scale, when you get acquired by a company, the metrics used to track companies may change a lot. When Cuberg joined Northvolt, how did the company&#8217;s metrics change? </p><blockquote><p><strong>Richard</strong>: We are fortunate to have structural and cultural alignment with Northvolt. Many acquisitions don't go well because the small company gets absorbed into a larger entity. They slow down and there's politics and misalignment of objectives. Northvolt has the wisdom to be hands-off when it comes to the integration, and it&#8217;s up to us to go and ask if we need their help with anything. Otherwise, they've left us basically independent to continue pursuing the aviation business opportunity, which is very distinct in their current business line. That&#8217;s the beauty of being distinct in terms of the business we're building, is that you don't have this misalignment that might come up where we are asked pursue a completely different set of objectives. We've been doing very much what we were planning to do anyway, just with a lot more resources support.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Intercalation</strong>: You've been on this journey for a couple of years. What's Richard doing 5-10 years from now?</p><blockquote><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Hopefully, leading the effort to deploy our technology in aviation and automotive at a large scale. There's going to be a lot more work to do to advance the technology and mature the manufacturing. </p></blockquote><p><strong>Intercalation</strong>: What are the hardest challenges that you're facing right now?</p><blockquote><p><strong>Richard</strong>: It's going through this process of increasing TRL (technology readiness level) and maturing and scaling up. That is the simple answer for  any battery technology, that is the hardest piece. </p><p>We're not making a solid state technology, which is astronomically hard. Our technology is much more viable, but it's still hard to figure out all the different things you have to do to make this into a product. So just maturing across the board, from technology to materials through to production process, and ramp as fast as possible to meet customer demand in short timelines.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Intercalation</strong>: I'm curious about how Northvolt approached you. What was the story of your first engagement?</p><blockquote><p><strong>Richard</strong>: It was directly with Peter Carlson (Northvolt CEO), I've known him for a few years and met him at a conference in France three years ago, we've been in touch for a while. He was interested in doing technology scouting in 2019. I remember he would visit us and they were impressed with the progress we have made in a couple of years and deploying actual multi amp-hour pouch cells with different customers, it's just something you don't see at startups our size, or even startups larger than our size back then. That really caught their eye.</p><p>Northvolt met with the most of the promising startups around the US, and ultimately Cuberg was the best fit in terms of their own values and what they see as important in the battery industry and a credible bet to scale this up.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Intercalation</strong>: It seems like their appetite for trying out new startups is quite high, so that's a good sign that gigafactories are trying to innovate as well. Do you have an estimated timeline for when this is going to be deployed?</p><blockquote><p><strong>Richard</strong>: We're sprinting to mature our technology. At the same time, our aviation customers are working hard to design, certify and deploy their various aircraft programmes. We see entry into service around 2025 for a variety of platforms, both air taxi as well as like electric plane platforms.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Intercalation</strong>: Is there anything that you want to mention that I didn't ask about? </p><blockquote><p><strong>Richard</strong>: I'll be honest, I'm concerned with where the industry is going, in terms of the speculation that's going on in the battery industry and EVs broadly. There&#8217;s so much money in the stock market for a variety of macroeconomic reasons, even more money concentrated in the electrification industry. This is not a bad thing. We need tons of capital to make electrification happen. But if you look at the history of battery startups and technologies, times like these are when investors get burned. A lot of companies that generate a lot of hype end up not making it work out. It's very easy to generate a tonne of hype. </p><p>My word of caution is to pick winners carefully, emphasizing the need for genuine transparency in the industry surrounding next-generation technologies and the development of their performance, as there is so much misinformation regarding what technologies are real and feasible and which aren&#8217;t. As more investment is funneled into the sector, highlighting how important it is as an investor, customer, or professional to understand what companies are delivering on their promises and are making a positive impact on the industry to strive to better the mobility market.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Intercalation</strong>: Thanks, Richard! </p><p><em>Cuberg is looking for talented, motivated scientists and engineers at all levels with a solid background in materials science and engineering and/or electrochemistry to help build the future of electric mobility.

Abraham released an article in October 2020 <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsenergylett.0c02181">comparing sodium ion to lithium-ion</a> counterparts.&nbsp; Sodium-ion research has actually progressed alongside Li-ion since the 1980s, but&nbsp;lithium prevailed commercially by meeting the needs of electronic devices in the 1990s and 2000s.&nbsp; Abraham highlights three main papers by <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/cr500192f">Yabuuchi</a> (Japan), <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/2.0201816jes">Mariyappan</a> (France), and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589778019300156">Zhang</a> (Saudi Arabia) which were published well in advance of today&#8217;s battery frenzy.</p><p>In July of 2021, CATL announced visions of launching <a href="https://www.electrive.com/2021/07/29/catl-presents-sodium-ion-battery-design/">sodium-based rechargeable batteries</a> that are competitive with LFP (lithium iron phosphate) counterparts.&nbsp;The Company could start production by the end of 2023.</p><p>The supply chain dilemma around the lithium-ion battery industry is well known with nearly every major research firm predicting a further squeeze on the price of battery metals.&nbsp; Battery-grade lithium and related materials are in heavy demand, and although more lithium mining capacity is expected to come online throughout the year, the announcement from CATL suggests forward-thinking on the sustainability of the battery industry. Sodium-ion battery growth estimates vary and <a href="https://www.marketresearchengine.com/sodium-ion-batteries-market">Market Research Engine</a> projects a &gt;20% compound annual growth rate by 2025.</p><p><strong>Diving into Sodium</strong></p><p>An open-access paper by <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7655/ac01ef?utm_campaign=12-15-21+-+Several+of+our&amp;utm_source=Message&amp;utm_medium=Twitter#references">Tapia-Ruiz including various cited institutions</a> provides a consolidated breakdown of the various materials that have been experimented with to construct Na-ion batteries.&nbsp; The readily abundant sodium (ahem, table salt) coupled with its ability to be used in existing manufacturing processes brings excitement to a rapidly evolving rechargeable battery industry.</p><p>The sodium concentration in Earth&#8217;s crust is about 2.6% or roughly 500 times that of lithium, it is also much easier to extract from seawater. The alkali metal is located directly beneath Li on the periodic table and contains an extra electron orbital which makes it unique when considering its application in a battery.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4511950f-3d02-40dd-aeb6-e7728c2b9894_838x599.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4511950f-3d02-40dd-aeb6-e7728c2b9894_838x599.png" width="358" height="255.89737470167066" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4511950f-3d02-40dd-aeb6-e7728c2b9894_838x599.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:599,&quot;width&quot;:838,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:358,&quot;bytes&quot;:364590,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4511950f-3d02-40dd-aeb6-e7728c2b9894_838x599.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4511950f-3d02-40dd-aeb6-e7728c2b9894_838x599.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4511950f-3d02-40dd-aeb6-e7728c2b9894_838x599.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4511950f-3d02-40dd-aeb6-e7728c2b9894_838x599.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The redox chemistry is more complicated with sodium because various sodium active materials generating 2.5-3.5V can be considered.&nbsp;

They are different from graphite in that they have a higher interlayer spacing (&gt;.34 nm) and are connected by disordered carbon regions.&nbsp; The larger spacing enables more efficient Na diffusion and intercalation sites at the anode.&nbsp; Research is cited to further understand the Na insertion mechanism and how various functional groups play a role.</p><p>One of the biggest challenges is to improve storage capacity over traditional graphite in LIBs (&gt;372 mAh/g).&nbsp; The measured capacities for hard carbons vs. Na metal in half cells are around 300 mAh/g.</p><p><strong>2.2 Titanium-based oxides</strong></p><p>Titanium-based oxides are another of the most promising and versatile Na anode materials due to their low cost.&nbsp; They are safer than carbon-based anodes given their higher operating voltage preventing sodium plating.</p><p>One of the biggest hurdles is TiO2&#8217;s low electronic conductivity and slow Na+ ion (de) insertion kinetics.&nbsp; Ti4+ ions make the material an electrical insulator which hinders Na+ ion diffusion.&nbsp; Bulk and surface structure modifications have been done to try to improve these characteristics.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311690669_Improving_the_sodiation_performance_of_Na2Ti3O7_through_Nb-doping">Elemental doping at &lt;5% concentration</a> from the lanthanide series (Nb) has been shown to decrease the bandgap energy, improving performance.</p><p>Further enhancements in electronic conductivity and understanding of material/electrolyte interface layers are cited as keys to improving these materials.</p><p><strong>2.3 Alloy and conversion materials</strong></p><p>Alloys with Na are made with p-block elements and some transition metals enabling very high capacities.&nbsp; However, the formation of sodiated alloys causes volume expansion that is worse than LIBs.&nbsp; The large volume expansion is worsened by continuous electrolyte reduction and rapid cycling decay.&nbsp; Some of the most interesting cited materials are Na3P (2596 mAh/g) and Na3Sb (660 mAh/g) which have high capacities.&nbsp; <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.5b13273">Antimony</a> is cited as one of the most promising materials since it possesses a large gravimetric charge storage capacity and several studies have shown long cyclability.&nbsp; Antimony composites coupled with hard carbon are suggested as a potential way to improve these materials.</p><p><strong>2.4 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides</strong></p><p>The stacking of 2D nanosheets of materials with high conductivity is considered a way to improve Na+ diffusion.&nbsp; Examples include 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides such as <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/nl201874w">molybdenum disulphide</a> which provides large channels and has a theoretical specific capacity of 670 mAh/g.&nbsp; There is not a lot of knowledge on the charge-storage mechanism, and characterization techniques are stated as ongoing efforts in this realm.</p><p><strong>2.5 Organic materials</strong></p><p>Sustainable anodes using organic molecules containing redox-active groups (carboxylate, azo, and imine) have shown some promise, but more efforts are needed to improve cycling stability and conductivities.</p><p><strong>Electrolytes and SEI Engineering</strong></p><p>Electrolyte use in LIBs is understood with 1M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate/dimethlycarbonate as a standard.&nbsp;Na-ion batteries are in their infancy and authors in various publications hint at the need for further understanding sodium&#8217;s role in inter and deintercalating electrodes.&nbsp;Sodium salts in traditional ether and carbonate solvents are by default options given their use in lithium ion batteries.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9be7c174-d179-436f-9437-67ffca8e7802_663x796.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9be7c174-d179-436f-9437-67ffca8e7802_663x796.png" width="295" height="354.1779788838612" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9be7c174-d179-436f-9437-67ffca8e7802_663x796.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:796,&quot;width&quot;:663,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:295,&quot;bytes&quot;:278634,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9be7c174-d179-436f-9437-67ffca8e7802_663x796.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9be7c174-d179-436f-9437-67ffca8e7802_663x796.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9be7c174-d179-436f-9437-67ffca8e7802_663x796.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9be7c174-d179-436f-9437-67ffca8e7802_663x796.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The SEI growth over time during a sodium ion battery&#8217;s lifetime is dependent on a variety of factors and various authors cite this as an area of focus.</p><p><strong>A Recap</strong></p><p>In the Battery 2030+ sodium ion workshop last year, the lead scientist speaking about the materials highlighted a few.&nbsp;It appears that on the cathode there is similar thinking with layered oxides, Prussian blue analogues, and NVPF (Na3V2(PO4)2F3) as promising candidates.</p><p>Hard carbon appears to be a popular choice on the anode side, while the electrolyte system is unclear.</p><h2><strong>Driving the Future?</strong></h2><p>The implications of sodium ion suggest that it could be a potential alternative to traditional lithium ion batteries given that specific energies and cost are comparable.&nbsp; Sodium ion batteries also have the unique ability to be stored and transported at 0V.&nbsp; The lower cost&nbsp;reports are very appealing and given the level of innovation in structural design from recent companies (cell-to-pack), some could surmise further optimization.&nbsp; Another interesting feature of sodium ion is that it is not entirely novel like other technologies.&nbsp; Plenty of research is cited from the 2010-2015 timeframe, so the question is whether any of it is ready for primetime.</p><p>Thank you for reading part 1 of the sodium ion series.&nbsp;

There are several steps in the process, and each company/factory has its own flavour of doing it (different C-rates, different temperatures, different # cycles, different voltages, etc) depending on what cells they&#8217;re making, and is very difficult to get this trade secret. </p><ol><li><p>It starts from charging cells to a low voltage (e.g. 1.5V) to protect the copper from corrosion, and then a rest session for electrolyte wetting.</p></li><li><p> The cells are charged/discharged at a very low C-rate (e.g. C/20) to ensure a stable SEI layer is formed. </p></li><li><p>After or during formation cycles, there could be steps at an elevated temperature too for further electrolyte wetting and SEI stabilization. </p></li><li><p>Cells are degassed before finally being sealed for shipment. </p></li></ol><p>The point of the formation step is to form the first charge/discharge cycles so they&#8217;re ready to go. The formation step is also used as quality control when you would find out if any cells are faulty if they: </p><ul><li><p>Don&#8217;t show the expected capacity during the first few cycles, perhaps to any defects throughout any of the previous manufacturing processes </p></li><li><p>Have unexpected dimensional changes/swelling</p></li></ul><h2><strong>The problem</strong></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Time.</strong> The whole process can last on the order of <strong><a href="https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/applications/solutions/battery-management-system/battery-formation/">20 hours</a> (maybe less) to 3 weeks</strong>. This makes it a bottleneck sometimes. Other times, it isn&#8217;t since the bottleneck is already baked into the process. </p></li><li><p><strong>Capital.</strong> There are significant costs in terms of <strong>floor space, equipment, and energy</strong> to process. There is some labour too, but can be quite hands-off as many processes are automated depending on the factory. </p></li><li><p><strong>Costs.</strong> <a href="https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1503280-modeling-performance-cost-lithium-ion-batteries-electric-drive-vehicles-third-edition">Nelson et al.</a> estimated it costs <strong>~32% of the entire manufacturing process. </strong>In terms of electricity usage, it uses a small amount &lt;1% of total energy costs per cell. In an industry where margins are thin, any amount of cost savings is attractive especially when manufacturing volumes are large.</p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F106f8c33-05c8-4870-a56b-870571b1c5c4_825x781.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F106f8c33-05c8-4870-a56b-870571b1c5c4_825x781.png" width="825" height="781" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/106f8c33-05c8-4870-a56b-870571b1c5c4_825x781.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:781,&quot;width&quot;:825,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Image preview&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Image preview" title="Image preview" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F106f8c33-05c8-4870-a56b-870571b1c5c4_825x781.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F106f8c33-05c8-4870-a56b-870571b1c5c4_825x781.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F106f8c33-05c8-4870-a56b-870571b1c5c4_825x781.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F106f8c33-05c8-4870-a56b-870571b1c5c4_825x781.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S258900422100300X</figcaption></figure></div><h2>How big is this problem?</h2>

We were excited to work with <strong><a href="http://batterybits.org/">BatteryBits</a></strong> to compile the annual <strong>BATTERY REPORT. </strong></p><p>This report is <strong>130+ pages long </strong>(get yourself a coffee and block off 2 hours of your day!) and summarizes the most significant developments in the battery industry in 2021. It&#8217;s a comprehensive and accessible overview of the current state of battery research, industry, talent, and policy. The battery industry is exciting, and we hope to lower the activation energy for anyone looking to learn more or break into the industry, and hopefully, we can catalyze more conversations on the state of batteries and the trajectory for the future. </p><p><strong>Click the button below to access:</strong></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.batterybrunch.org/battery-report&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;BATTERY REPORT 2021&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://www.batterybrunch.org/battery-report"><span>BATTERY REPORT 2021</span></a></p><p>Huge appreciation to all the authors, contributors, and advisory committee who took part in the report.

A new study in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-021-00915-5">Nature Energy</a> finds that, instead of electrifying the entire rail infrastructure, cheap LFP batteries can enable retrofitting US freight trains from diesel-electric to battery-electric. <a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2021/11/23/big-batteries-on-wheels-can-deliver-zero-emissions-rail-while-securing-the-grid/">Benefits include a rapid conversion, and improved health and economic outcomes for low-income communities.</a> Modelling shows that a single boxcar with a 14 MWh LFP battery can enable a 241 km range. The entire US freight rail sector would need around 220 GWh of batteries, but it would also have the potential to act as mobile grid storage.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Germany has already placed orders for <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2021/11/30/more-battery-electric-trains-coming-to-germany/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">44 battery-electric trains</a>.</p><div><hr></div><h2>&#128640; Startup Tracker</h2><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://members.luxresearchinc.com/research/news_commentary/41643?hsp=true">Solid Power</a></strong> (US) received $30m investment from SK Innovation for solid-state battery pre-commercial production. </p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://cornishlithium.com/company-announcements/cornish-lithium-secures-18m-funding-package-from-techmet/">Cornish Lithium</a></strong> (UK) secures &#163;18m from Techmet for domestic lithium extraction and supply in the UK. </p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/daimler-stellantis-invest-solid-state-battery-maker-factorial-energy">Factorial Energy</a></strong> (US) receives corporate investment from Daimler, Stellantis for lithium metal batteries.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.jpost.com/jpost-tech/make-my-day-raises-43m-to-boost-charging-optimization-solutions-687577">Make My Day</a></strong> (Israel) raises $4.3m for smart software solutions that are designed to help EV drivers and fleets more efficiently manage their charging needs.</p></li><li><p>Imperial-spinout <strong><a href="https://www.uktech.news/news/imperial-college-london-spin-out-startup-raises-1-5m-funding-to-develop-smart-battery-software-20211202">Breathe Battery Technologies</a></strong><a href="https://www.uktech.news/news/imperial-college-london-spin-out-startup-raises-1-5m-funding-to-develop-smart-battery-software-20211202"> (UK)</a> raises &#163;1.5m seed round for smart battery software</p></li><li><p>Cummins invests an undisclosed amount in <strong><a href="https://www.cummins.com/news/releases/2021/11/30/cummins-invests-sion-power-develop-lithium-metal-technology">Sion Power</a></strong> (US) for lithium metal batteries. </p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www-imperial-ac-uk.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.imperial.ac.uk/news/232276/imperial-startup-transforming-wireless-charging-raises/amp/">Bumblebee Power</a></strong><a href="https://www-imperial-ac-uk.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.imperial.ac.uk/news/232276/imperial-startup-transforming-wireless-charging-raises/amp/"> (UK)</a> raises &#163;750k seed round for wireless charging for EVs.</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2>&#128197; What we&#8217;re working on</h2><p>Remember the <strong><a href="https://www.batterybrunch.org/state-of-battery-2020">State of Batteries 2020 Annual Report</a></strong> that we did last year in collaboration with the BatteryBits team?

We note 22 out of 33 companies are pre-revenue which is a high risk, which means a lot of investment dollars could be at risk since the company is still in its early stages despite being public.

It&#8217;ll be great to kick off by learning about the journey that led you to your current work at ARK.&nbsp;</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>Sam Korus:</strong> Great to e-meet you too! I joined ARK in 2015 right after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania where I studied cognitive science with a focus on computation and cognition. When it came time to look for jobs, I knew I wanted it to be technology related, but the three main criteria I was looking for were:</p><ol><li><p>A steep learning curve</p></li><li><p>A small company where I wouldn&#8217;t be a cog in a machine</p></li><li><p>A company filled with people I want to spend time with and learn from</p></li></ol><p>I told that criteria to my siblings and I was fortunate that my sister flagged a recruiting email ARK sent to her college. I reached out to ARK, went through an in-depth interview process, and the rest is history.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Intercalation: The battery industry has been very vocal on impending raw material shortages for lithium-ion cells. How do you factor these supply chain risks into EV growth projections, and will the supply-demand disconnect be as severe as anticipated?</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>Sam</strong>: We have done a fair amount of modelling on both the supply and demand side for electric vehicle batteries. All of that research is on our adviser website ark-invest.com, which I welcome everyone to check out. There likely shouldn&#8217;t be any constraint from a pure raw material perspective. That is, there&#8217;s plenty of lithium in the ground. Where a constraint could emerge is in the extraction and processing of the raw materials. Having said that, we have seen several boom/bust cycles dealing with commodities and CEOs like Elon Musk have been signalling to companies that they should ramp production.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><strong>Intercalation: What are some of the trends you are paying attention to in the energy storage market? How do you see emerging technologies like solid-state or lithium-sulfur fitting in with the learning rates of conventional lithium-ion across EV and non-EV applications?</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>Sam</strong>: There are so many exciting things happening with energy storage today. That ranges from exciting end use cases like micromobility, eVTOLs/aviation, Bitcoin and energy storage, to the batteries and chemistries themselves like you mentioned. I think an important question to ask with &#8220;breakthrough&#8221; chemistries is: what does the market look like when that battery gets to scale? The history of lithium-ion batteries is steady incremental improvement. When a solid-state battery gets to scale what is it competing against? Often new technologies gain traction by opening up a new market. Perhaps better energy density batteries open up aviation use cases or VR/AR rather than go head to head with EV batteries right away.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Intercalation: We really enjoyed your seminar on Wright&#8217;s law at the <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/venkatv/bmws.html">Battery Modelling Webinar Series</a>. We&#8217;d love to learn more about your approach towards understanding how diverse industries like energy storage, automation, and space exploration will scale into the future.</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>Sam</strong>: Wow, this could be a very long answer. A similarity between all these industries is that there are technologically driven cost declines that are moving us across demand tipping points. In energy storage, it&#8217;s the battery cost decline and EVs reaching price parity with gas-powered cars. In automation, it&#8217;s robot cost declines and AI making it so small batch manufacturers can automate economically. In space, it&#8217;s reusable rockets, satellites, and antennas are all coming down in cost making LEO constellations economic. So broadly speaking the approach is: determine if there are cost declines taking place and if so what is it, evaluate unit economics to determine where a demand tipping point may be, then look at the price elasticity of demand and see what the market could grow to/think about new possible markets.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Intercalation: Finally, what do you do to recharge your personal batteries?</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>Sam</strong>: Working out in the morning energizes me for the day, and then I always get a boost from spending time with family and friends.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><strong>Intercalation: Thank you for your time and insights, Sam!</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>Sam</strong>: Thank you! It&#8217;s amazing how the battery community has evolved and you&#8217;re helping build the community even more.</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h3><strong>&#127774; As always, thanks for reading!</strong></h3><p>&#128231; For tips, feedback, and inquiries,&nbsp;<a href="mailto:intercalationstation@gmail.com">please reach out</a>.</p><p>&#127760; Follow on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/IntercalationSt">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/intercalationstation">LinkedIn</a>, and our <a href="https://www.intercalation.co/">website</a> for more information.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[#SESBatteryWorld]]></title><description><![CDATA["The future is solid, the present is fluid" &#8212; Prof Shirley Meng]]></description><link>https://intercalationstation.substack.com/p/ses-battery-world</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://intercalationstation.substack.com/p/ses-battery-world</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Intercalation Station]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 19:17:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.substack.com%2Fmedia%2FFDSJ5M8WQAUUh7s.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you enjoy this newsletter please give us a share and subscribe!

According to SES, this solid anode layer enables the high energy density afforded by lithium metal without the inherent risk of dendrite growth, <a href="https://electricautonomy.ca/2020/09/18/moli-energy-lithium-battery-technology/">which has historically been a problem</a>.

SES has tested Apollo cells at 1C, C/3, and C/10 and says they can be readily made with today's manufacturing equipment.

SES noted that the cell presented onstage was one of the first they&#8217;ve produced and, as a result, there&#8217;s very limited test results on Apollo cells. SES founder and CEO Qichao Hu also mentioned a slurry of challenges ahead for the outsized form factor:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Scaleup</strong>. Upsizing from 4.2 Ah to 107 Ah is a whopper of a task. Key challenges include (1) making their solvent and high concentration liquid electrolyte in-house, and (2) mass manufacturing the large-format lithium anode with a coating, which no manufacturer currently makes today.</p></li><li><p><strong>Technical</strong>. Apollo cells will require external pressure due to anode expansion, Hu confirmed. This has been tackled through internal cell design, pack design, and module design to accommodate cell swelling.

Overall, this is a step forward for lithium metal, a pre-requisite for many high-capacity applications requiring volumetric densities of &gt;1000 Wh/L. </p><p>However, the event does invite some critique. The 3rd party validation results look promising, but we&#8217;ll need to see repeated fast-charge testing and more safety tests to be completely sold. It also appears to be very early stages for the Apollo form factor, which faces a whole mountain of manufacturing challenges to overcome (and we&#8217;ve yet to see much data from the 107 Ah cells).

It&#8217;s important to note that these performance gains are mostly due to geometry &#8212; the 4680 is 5.5x larger by volume than the 2170 &#8212; but a lot of clever engineering has taken place to make this size increase possible. The move represents a major commitment to Tesla for Panasonic, despite the cell producer <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Panasonic-unloads-entire-Tesla-stake">selling off its financial stake in Tesla last year</a>, and Tesla sourcing cells from other battery makers to keep up with demand.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/baf70d6f-8c85-45ae-b30d-3332bad9265e">Britishvolt</a> is close to securing &#163;200 million for its planned gigafactory in the North of England. The company is also planning a 60 GWh plant in Quebec through its Canadian subsidiary, <a href="https://electricautonomy.ca/2021/10/07/britishvolt-canada-battery-cell-factory/">British Volt Canada Inc.</a> (a real thing), although there&#8217;s no word yet on whether the company has financing for this.</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2>&#128300; Research News</h2><h4>Checking the checklists</h4><p>As journals continue to encourage best practices in battery research, ACS Energy Letters has published <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsenergylett.1c01675">standard protocols of redox flow batteries</a> as well as a <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsenergylett.1c01710">checklist for battery modelling</a>, which included examples of the <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsenergylett.1c01710/suppl_file/nz1c01710_si_001.pdf">checklist filled out for previous articles</a>. These checklists have the hard task of maintaining brevity and applicability for the diverse types of battery research, which might be why a majority of new research still do not (or can not) include them.</p><h4>Upcycling NMC</h4><p>A collaboration between A123 and USABC has led to the development of a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435121004335?via%3Dihub">recycling technique for cathodes that creates a unique microstructured NMC111</a>, which allows for the recycled material to outlast commercial materials. The public is also very interested in battery recycling, as the paper also got <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/qc5teb/study_recycled_lithium_batteries_as_good_as_newly/">massive attention on Reddit</a>. </p><h4>LiionDB</h4><p>Shameless self-plug: Andrew &amp; colleagues have recently released <strong><a href="https://www.liiondb.com/">LiionDB</a></strong>, a database of battery parameters that can be used for physics-based modelling:</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/ndrewwang/status/1450839925792858116&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;&#128267;&#128226; Introducing &#127760;<a class=\&quot;tweet-url\&quot; href=\&quot;http://LiionDB.com\&quot;>LiionDB.com</a>, a database of 1000+ parameters for Li-ion battery modeling!\n\nReleased with our review preprint: <a class=\&quot;tweet-url\&quot; href=\&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09879\&quot;>arxiv.org/abs/2110.09879</a>\n\n<span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@FaradayInst</span> <span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@batterymodel</span> <span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@brosaplanella</span> <span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@JPLeHoux</span> <span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@bout_kieran</span> <span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@jacqlynedge</span> <span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@camsooper</span>  <span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@DavidHowey</span> <span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@Emjewls</span> &quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;ndrewwang&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Andrew Wang&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Wed Oct 20 15:02:48 +0000 2021&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[{&quot;img_url&quot;:&quot;https://cdn.substack.com/image/upload/w_728,c_limit/l_twitter_play_button_rvaygk,w_120/uiwdv2jvhg0en7flx989&quot;,&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;https://t.co/Et04p3zY8h&quot;,&quot;alt_text&quot;:null}],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:47,&quot;like_count&quot;:205,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:&quot;https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1450834485340221450/pu/vid/480x270/2Fjk9xO2h9dC2pp7.mp4?tag=12&quot;}"><a href="https://twitter.com/ndrewwang/status/1450839925792858116" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-user-avatar" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/twitter_name/w_36/ndrewwang.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @ndrewwang"><span class="tweet-author-name">Andrew Wang </span><span class="tweet-author">@ndrewwang</span></div>&#128267;&#128226; Introducing &#127760;<a class="tweet-url" href="http://LiionDB.com" target="_blank">LiionDB.com</a>, a database of 1000+ parameters for Li-ion battery modeling!

I also spoke with folks from cloud battery analytics like Accure Battery Intelligence, Nortical, and Volytica.</p><p>Cloud-based battery intelligence systems typically do the following:</p><ul><li><p>Estimate <strong>remaining useful capacity</strong> and <strong>internal resistance</strong>. Below, I refer to them as <em>degradation parameters</em>.</p></li><li><p>Collect and chart state-of-charge, voltage, current, and degradation parameters to let users see what happens with their individual batteries in the cloud.</p></li><li><p>Predict the remaining useful life of batteries to inform insurance, capacity planning, and procurement.</p></li></ul><p>Li et al. proposed that batteries&#8217; degradation parameter estimations should be sent from the cloud to the onboard battery management system (BMS) because they could be more accurate than the estimations that the onboard BMS could compute on its own.</p><p>I think this might be a reasonable approach only for very small batteries, such as those of electric bikes, but not batteries of electric vehicles or energy storage systems. Onboard BMS of the latter should estimate the degradation parameters on their own.</p><h3><strong>Onboard BMS needs to know the degradation parameters to improve safety and prolong the battery&#8217;s life</strong></h3><p>There are well-known reasons why information about batteries&#8217; degradation should be present in the cloud. Knowing the state of batteries&#8217; degradation enables businesses to predict batteries&#8217; remaining lifetimes and to procure new batteries more accurately. For large battery fleets, this is clearly the task for a cloud system to keep track of each battery&#8217;s state-of-health so that operators can schedule replacements when these batteries reach their predetermined end-of-life level of degradation. The battery&#8217;s state-of-health also informs the price of insurance against a battery failure.</p><p>It&#8217;s perhaps less widely appreciated how knowing the battery&#8217;s degradation parameters in the onboard BMS enables better failure prediction and more efficient control of the battery.</p><p>These are some of the possible signs of the onset of a cell failure that a reliable onboard BMS should detect (and, perhaps, stop the battery operation and alert the owner of the battery or the EV):</p><ul><li><p><strong>A cell starts to degrade very rapidly, over the course of weeks or days.</strong> Note that a cloud battery intelligence could detect this rapid degradation, too, but only if the batteries come online frequently and upload all their telemetry to the cloud, which is a valid assumption for city taxi and transportation fleets, as well as some forms of stationary energy storage, but not for consumer electric vehicles. See the section &#8220;Privacy and familiarity concerns cause public hesitation&#8221; below for more on this.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cell&#8217;s coulombic efficiency drops from nearly 100% to a lower value.</strong> This could be a sign of a parasitic reaction started inside a cell, which, in turn, could lead to thermal runaway or venting.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cell&#8217;s self-discharge rate raises from nearly 0 to a noticeable value.</strong> This could be a sign of a short circuit.</p></li></ul><p>I have argued before that <a href="https://www.notion.so/Estimate-all-cell-parameters-at-once-e371385caad245e5987d4084d14c7691">a robust algorithm should estimate most cell parameters at once</a> because all parameters conflate within the sole output signal: the voltage. This means that <strong>to detect the onset of some battery failures, the onboard BMS is effectively required to estimate the battery's degradation parameters.</strong></p><p>Knowing the degradation parameters in the onboard BMS could also help to avoid accelerated degradation (<a href="https://mellow-kileskus-a65.notion.site/Positive-feedback-loops-of-cell-degradation-6e9fb88b5ccd4819a5238734c42538a9">in a positive feedback loop</a>), thus prolonging the battery&#8217;s life. <strong>The remaining capacity estimate should be used to adjust the battery's maximum and minimum cutoff voltages for charge and discharge, respectively.</strong> A new battery cell is balanced so that, for example, 0% stoichiometry of anode corresponds to 95% stoichiometry of cathode, and the half-cell open-circuit voltages of anode and cathode at these stoichiometries add up to the cutoff discharge voltage specified by the battery manufacturer. But after some<a href="https://www.notion.so/Loss-of-lithium-inventory-30e126a7c2004b179bf28c9a8ccbbd75"> loss of lithium inventory</a>, 0% stoichiometry of anode corresponds only to 90% stoichiometry of cathode, hence the voltage will still be higher than the initial cutoff. At this point, discharging the battery further would damage the anode and accelerate the battery degradation:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ad8e113-2fb5-44a4-a392-44c897de20ee_2048x431.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ad8e113-2fb5-44a4-a392-44c897de20ee_2048x431.png" width="1456" height="306" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3ad8e113-2fb5-44a4-a392-44c897de20ee_2048x431.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:306,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ad8e113-2fb5-44a4-a392-44c897de20ee_2048x431.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ad8e113-2fb5-44a4-a392-44c897de20ee_2048x431.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ad8e113-2fb5-44a4-a392-44c897de20ee_2048x431.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ad8e113-2fb5-44a4-a392-44c897de20ee_2048x431.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Picture from [2]</figcaption></figure></div><p>Similarly, after some loss of active material(s), the BMS should adjust the charge/discharge power limits and the value of &#8220;1C current&#8221; so that they correspond to the same current density as in a pristine battery.</p><h3><strong>Cloud computation exposes energy infrastructure to new risks</strong></h3><p>Now, as we established that the onboard BMS benefits from having accurate estimates of the battery&#8217;s degradation parameters, the next question is how and where they should be computed?</p><p>Li et al. suggest in their paper that the degradation parameters should be computed in the cloud and then sent back to the onboard BMS over the internet. I argue below that this approach incurs many problems and, ultimately, is not effective.</p><p><strong>Estimating degradation parameters that the battery&#8217;s onboard BMS regularly receives from the cloud is a form of control</strong>, and centralising control in the cloud exposes the energy infrastructure to some highly impactful risks. Batteries are safety-critical systems: when poorly managed, they can catch fire, explode, and harm people in their vicinity.</p><p>Imagine this trivial situation: <strong>developers deploy a new version of cloud software that has a bug that causes incorrect estimates,</strong> or stops the processing of battery telemetry, or crashes when onboard BMS try to fetch new estimates from it.</p><p>Of course, one can say that developers can mitigate this risk by testing the software in a staging environment, rolling out new versions carefully, monitoring errors and quality metrics, etc. Yes, this is all possible, but in practice, developers tend to cut the &#8220;unnecessary&#8221; steps of the deployment process as long as everything goes well: see<a href="https://medium.com/10x-curiosity/boundaries-of-failure-rasmussens-model-of-how-accidents-happen-58dc61eb1cf"> Rasmussen&#8217;s model of how accidents happen</a>. The only way to combat this dynamic is to introduce hard boundaries that can&#8217;t be circumvented. For example, engineers at Amazon AWS<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-center/controls/"> can&#8217;t make any operational changes or deployments across Availability Zones</a>, which I think is one of the reasons why AWS has had much fewer serious outages than Google Cloud Platform.</p><p>In the case of batteries, parameter estimations should be built into the onboard BMS and battery operators (rather than BMS developers) should be responsible for deploying BMS software (EV owners should explicitly agree to install a new over-the-air update). In this situation, <em>new BMS versions will arrive at batteries slowly</em>, over the course of months. If there are bugs in the new BMS that cause problems with batteries, operators and EV owners who installed updates earlier are likely to discover these problems and report them to developers while the new version is still deployed only on a minor portion of all batteries that use that particular BMS.</p><p>Even if developers do everything &#8220;right&#8221; and never let bugs into their cloud estimation of battery parameters, unless the estimations of battery parameters are implemented on top of multi-datacenter, multi-cloud computing infrastructure, cloud-centric estimation software is at risk to datacenter and cloud provider outages.</p><p>There are two more types of risk that are least probable, but also cannot be mitigated even in principle when batteries depend on parameter estimations done in the cloud.</p><p>Terrorists can hack into the cloud and send wrong estimates to batteries. As far as I know, there haven&#8217;t been such attacks on battery infrastructure yet, but there has been <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/05/13/a-cyber-attack-exposes-risks-to-americas-energy-infrastructure">a ransomware attack on pipeline infrastructure</a> in America in May 2021.</p><p>Finally, what if the internet is cut off in a grid blackout? This is exactly the moment when batteries must remain operational and reliable.</p><h3><strong>Cloud estimations will still require onboard backups</strong></h3><p>Li et al. suggest mitigating some of the risks described above by providing a fallback from the cloud parameter estimations to less accurate estimations that run on the onboard BMS:</p><p>&#8220;The functions which are required at each time point during operation should also run locally, guaranteeing the system safety. An advanced version of these functions will run in the cloud with advanced algorithms, which provide higher accuracy while requiring high computation power.&#8221;</p><p>I think there are multiple problems with this architecture.</p><p>First of all, it doesn&#8217;t address the main risk of cloud estimations: a faulty deployment that starts to send wrong parameter estimates to batteries. If the onboard BMS has to decide between &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;bad&#8221; estimates, not only is this very fragile, it also implies that the onboard BMS can be at least as &#8220;smart&#8221; as the estimation software in the cloud: but then, why wouldn&#8217;t it make good estimations itself?</p><p>In general, implementing a fallback that works not just in theory, but in practice can be very hard and is also subject to sociotechnical problems similar to the problem of &#8220;lazy developers not following proper practices&#8221;: since the fallback is not <em>normally</em> used, it will get little attention and testing. This could go unnoticed until a big failure happens. Jacob Gabrielson (working for AWS) wrote a good article on this topic: &#8220;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/avoiding-fallback-in-distributed-systems/">Avoid fallback in distributed systems</a>&#8221;.</p><p>Finally, could cloud estimations actually be noticeably more accurate than algorithms running on the onboard BMS? Battery parameter estimation algorithms take just a few time series as their inputs. They are not comparable with real-time video analysis or natural language processing algorithms that either process a lot of data or require large models that cannot fit into embedded computers (however, this too can soon change due to the very quick progress in ML model optimisation). In the end, BMS algorithms that can run on embedded computers would only have a marginally higher error compared to those run on big servers in the cloud. <strong>Time and effort are better spent on improving the algorithms themselves, rather than setting up ultra-reliable cloud infrastructure for computing and delivering the estimates to the batteries, as well as maintaining the fallback.</strong></p><p>As embedded computers become cheaper and more efficient, more and more advanced algorithms can be executed on them. This trend will not reverse, and I think it will make the architecture where battery parameters are estimated in the cloud mostly obsolete by 2025.</p><h3><strong>Privacy and familiarity concerns cause public hesitation</strong></h3><p>If we, the battery industry, want to accelerate the transition towards electric mobility, we should think not only about technical aspects such as performance, efficiency, and safety but also about customer psychology.</p><p><strong>Consumers place a lot of value on the </strong><em><strong>trustworthiness</strong></em><strong> of technology solutions.</strong> When it comes to battery-powered products like EVs, there is a difference between cloud-connected and cloud-reliant. While folks may be happy that an over-the-air update improves their Tesla&#8217;s efficiency, many would not like the risk of doing irreversible damage to their batteries if they drove without internet reception.</p><p>This topic has been widely covered in the field of smart homes and the internet of things. It's not a big deal if a glitch on your internet-connected fridge causes your ice cream to melt or your smart toaster to burn your toast, but what if <a href="https://qz.com/1493748/how-one-lightbulb-could-allow-hackers-to-burgle-your-home/">hackers could unlock your front door via your wifi lightbulb</a>? The same logic could be applied to the safety and security of batteries.</p><p>Similarly, a lot of personal information is embedded in the way we cycle our batteries. If all battery history, SoC and SoH information was leaked on the cloud, one could reverse engineer the data to work out someone's personal information such as their schedule at home and work, frequented locations, charging spots, and more.</p><h3><strong>Estimating degradation parameters onboard doesn&#8217;t mean we should stop doing estimations in the cloud</strong></h3><p>There are good reasons to continue estimating battery&#8217;s degradation parameters in cloud battery intelligence systems, while the onboard BMS is also computing these estimations and sending them to the cloud as telemetry. <strong>Continuously comparing these two estimates in the cloud, especially if they are computed using different algorithms, ensures that we notice if one of these estimations becomes biased.</strong> Any discrepancy between the estimates could be used to learn more about how do they work in a virtuous feedback cycle. The onboard and cloud algorithms have different strengths: the cloud has access to how a big number of similar batteries degrade over time and can compare their telemetry to come up with more robust estimates. The onboard algorithms have access to very high-resolution telemetry data.</p><p>Cloud battery intelligence systems could also serve as a playground for making improvements in estimation algorithms. When developers become confident that the new algorithms are robust and more accurate, they can implement them in the onboard BMS.</p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>Computing the degradation parameters of batteries in the cloud makes immediate practical sense when the onboard BMS of the batteries don't calculate these parameters themselves. However, this is not the right architecture for battery digitalisation if we try to design it from the ground up: computing parameters for batteries in the cloud exposes batteries to unnecessary risks due to centralisation. Also, people may not trust batteries that depend on receiving something from the cloud for safe operation. Yet, <strong>reliability and trust are precisely what Li-ion batteries must strive for the most because<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kpkairies_battery-electricvehicles-automotive-activity-6829316750765527040-obAB"> they already &#8220;walk on very thin ice&#8221;</a></strong>.</p><p>Electric vehicles&#8217; adoption rate could be seriously hampered if a massive battery failure will happen because the batteries are controlled from a single cloud location.</p><p>Estimating degradation parameters and sending them to the onboard BMS makes sense for small batteries, such as those of electric city bikes or scooters, for several reasons. The batteries are smaller and hence fires are less catastrophic. The onboard BMS should consume very little power. Finally, all bikes in these fleets should be constantly online, anyway.</p><p><strong>Things like the remaining battery&#8217;s life (calendar time or a number of cycles) should still be estimated in the cloud</strong> because these estimates depend on the acceptable remaining capacity and internal resistance limits which, in turn, depend on how the particular battery is used (for example, what range the EV should have, or what instantaneous power should the energy storage system be able to deliver). The onboard BMS couldn&#8217;t know these acceptable limits <em>a priori</em>. These limits could even be optimisation parameters for algorithms that try to calculate the optimal time when certain batteries, e. g. involved in peak-shaving energy storage applications, should be replaced with new ones. These algorithms could use the current and projected grid electricity prices, price and performance characteristics of replacement batteries, and other information that the onboard BMS couldn&#8217;t and shouldn&#8217;t know. The cloud estimation of batteries&#8217; remaining life uses the degradation parameters that are calculated in the onboard BMS and are sent to the cloud periodically.</p><h5><strong>References</strong></h5><p>[1]<a href="https://www.notion.so/Digital-twin-for-battery-systems-Cloud-BMS-with-online-SoC-and-SoH-estimation-961855fef4444153986e3be675c2f064"> </a><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X20308495">Digital twin for battery systems: Cloud battery management system with online state-of-charge and state-of-health estimation</a> (Li et al., 2020)</p><p>[2] <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775316316998">Degradation diagnostics for lithium ion cells</a> (Birkl et al., 2017)</p><div><hr></div><h3>&#127774;&nbsp;<strong>Thanks for reading!</strong></h3><p>&#128231; For tips, feedback, or inquiries,&nbsp;<a href="mailto:intercalationstation@gmail.com">please reach out</a>!</p><p>&#127760; Follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/IntercalationSt">Twitter</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/intercalationstation">LinkedIn</a>, and our <a href="https://www.intercalation.co/">website</a> for more information.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Battery Chats: Sam Bailey, Mewburn Ellis]]></title><description><![CDATA[A review of the LG vs SK case + a conversation with Sam Bailey, Partner and Patent Attorney at Mewburn Ellis]]></description><link>https://intercalationstation.substack.com/p/battery-chats-sam-bailey-mewburn</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://intercalationstation.substack.com/p/battery-chats-sam-bailey-mewburn</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Intercalation Station]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 11:03:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa218656c-9990-43be-b7ef-6dfb25f821ed_1198x777.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this issue, we work with Mewburn to bring an overview of the LG vs SK case, and a conversation with<strong> <a href="https://www.mewburn.com/our-people/sam-bailey">Sam Bailey</a></strong><a href="https://www.mewburn.com/our-people/sam-bailey">, Partner and Patent Attorney at Mewburn Ellis</a>.

With <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2021?mode=overview">global stock</a> up from less than 1 million in 2014 to more than 10 million in 2020, there is a real and ongoing shift in the automotive industry, fuelled by relentless innovation, government incentives and consumer eco-awareness.</p><p>And you know that it is big business when the President of the United States gets involved. In April 2021, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/11/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-the-electric-battery-dispute-settlement/">President Biden released a statement</a> on an electric battery dispute settlement between South Korean firms LG Chem and SK Innovation. The dispute, which had initially resulted in the US International Trade Commission imposing a 10-year ban on SK battery imports, was <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/11/986234531/south-korean-electric-vehicle-battery-makers-reach-1-8b-deal-to-end-trade-disput?t=1623773585801&amp;t=1630073045058">resolved</a> after SK agreed to pay LG Chem USD 1.8 bn plus ongoing royalties, together with a 10-year mutual covenant not to sue.</p><p><a href="https://intercalationstation.substack.com/p/big-autos-and-small-anodes">The dispute arose</a> after 77 employees moved from LG to SK and allegedly misappropriated trade secrets, which coincided with a 14-fold increase in SK&#8217;s battery supply contracts. Trade secrets are often a delicate, but increasingly critical, intellectual property (IP) asset involving confidential information which is of commercial value and which the owner has taken &#8220;reasonable steps&#8221; to protect (see <a href="https://www.mewburn.com/news-insights/understanding-europes-trade-secret-rules">our article here</a>). But there is a balance between the scope of the right and the extent a worker can practise their acquired skills and expertise when he/she moves job. In the present case, the US authorities ruled that SK had indeed infringed LG&#8217;s rights.</p><p><strong>Not just a legal matter</strong></p><p>President Biden&#8217;s statement showed that this dispute was more than just a legal matter &#8211; there was also a political edge. Before the ruling, SK had planned to build a USD 2.6 bn battery factory in the state of Georgia and to supply batteries for American-built electric Ford and Volkswagen vehicles. At the same time, the Biden administration was pledging an infrastructure plan that supported a greener US car industry, with USD 174 bn set aside for increasing electric vehicle sales and production. Yet the import ban resulted in <a href="https://www.electrive.com/2021/03/31/sk-innovation-considers-withdrawing-business-from-the-usa/">SK considering withdrawing its battery business in the USA</a>.</p><p>In what appears to be a positive result for the US economy, the settlement deal was struck shortly before the deadline for the President to review the decision. The court upheld LG&#8217;s trade secret rights thereby underlining the potential value of trade secrets as an IP asset, while the settlement resolved SK&#8217;s position and allowed competition in the battery sector, which should lead, according to popular economic axioms, to greater innovation, lower prices, and more choice for customers.</p><p><strong>What next for the industry?</strong></p><p>With companies spending a great amount of resources both in innovation and the protection of IP assets, the automotive industry and other sectors want certainty that their rights are properly and consistently enforceable. Despite the political backdrop, this case ultimately played out in accordance with IP infringement dispute theory, with LG&#8217;s trade secret rights being upheld and an injunction being placed on SK, which then lead to commercial licensing via the settlement agreement with compensation being considered a fair resolution by both parties to the conflict, and the market benefitting from competition.</p><p>Of course, the electric vehicle industry is no stranger to different approaches of enforcing intellectual property rights. Since 2014, Tesla have vowed to <em>&#8220;not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use our technology&#8221;</em>. As we discussed in our <a href="https://www.mewburn.com/news-insights/tesla-driving-battery-development-differently">previous article</a>, there are unsurprisingly several caveats to this open-source pledge and Tesla have continued to file a multitude of patent applications to protect their IP, but this philosophy has arguably assisted the monumental growth in this field.</p><p>It will be interesting to observe over the coming years whether these factors influence how IP rights are enforced in the electric vehicle industry. In view of the initial ruling, it can be expected that companies will want to keep a close watch on their trade secrets and the know-how that their employees exploit once they leave the business. The effect on patent enforcement is less clear, but patents will certainly remain a powerful tool to block competitors from infringing and to facilitate asset value.</p><p>The LG Chem versus SK Innovation case has underlined the EV industry&#8217;s status as a big player on the world stage. And whether it is batteries, motors or charging stations, there seems to be no handbrake on exciting new ideas and products in this fast-moving and fast-growing area. However, that growth means more investment and more competition, which (like the telecoms industry) also probably means more scrapping and complex IP litigation, especially between the bigger players. While at first glance this may seem like a negative, competition in fact tends to drive further innovation, to accelerate products to market, and to drive the evolution of effective market regulations and standards that, somewhat counterintuitively, can benefit agile smaller players and consumers, and all of which will hopefully lead to a cleaner and greener future.</p><h2>&#129489;&#8205;&#9878;&#65039;&#8205;&#128221; Battery Chats: Sam Bailey, Partner and Patent Attorney at Mewburn Ellis</h2><p>This week we chatted with <a href="https://www.mewburn.com/our-people/sam-bailey">Sam Bailey</a>!</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa218656c-9990-43be-b7ef-6dfb25f821ed_1198x777.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa218656c-9990-43be-b7ef-6dfb25f821ed_1198x777.png" width="1198" height="777" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a218656c-9990-43be-b7ef-6dfb25f821ed_1198x777.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:777,&quot;width&quot;:1198,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:461406,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa218656c-9990-43be-b7ef-6dfb25f821ed_1198x777.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa218656c-9990-43be-b7ef-6dfb25f821ed_1198x777.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa218656c-9990-43be-b7ef-6dfb25f821ed_1198x777.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa218656c-9990-43be-b7ef-6dfb25f821ed_1198x777.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Sam works principally on chemistry and materials science patents. &nbsp;He has particular expertise in managing IP strategies for clients in the advanced materials sector.&nbsp; His PhD in carbon nanotechnology provides an excellent technical basis for this work and has led to him leading the firm&#8217;s specialist technology group focusing on Energy Storage technology; including battery chemistry, separators, electrolytes, and cell architecture.&nbsp; Sam joined Mewburn Ellis LLP in 2002 qualifying as a European Patent Attorney in 2006 and a UK Chartered Patent Attorney in 2007. He became a partner in 2010.</p><p><strong>Intercalation: How did you get into batteries and patent law?</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>Sam Bailey:</strong> I did a PhD in materials chemistry and while I enjoyed the work, I was looking for a slightly more stable career.&nbsp; My supervisor mentioned patent law as an interesting option that would continue to use my scientific knowledge but in a commercial setting rather than research.&nbsp; I applied and ended up taking a trainee job with Mewburn Ellis.</p><p>The job is very varied in terms of the technologies that you work on; particularly while you are training and are still forming your own relationships with clients.&nbsp; So my work on battery technology really took off when I qualified as a patent attorney and my client base became more stable.&nbsp; Quite a lot of the battery work that I&#8217;m doing now comes from Japan but as a firm we handle battery technologies from all over the world.&nbsp; The battery work that I do is also something that I take a huge personal interest in; both because I find the technology fascinating but also for the massive part that batteries are going to play in the energy systems of the future.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Intercalation: What&#8217;s your role at Mewburn and what does your typical week at the firm look like?</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>Sam</strong>: I&#8217;m now a partner at Mewburn so alongside my patent work I have other responsibilities involved with running the firm and training new attorneys in my team.&nbsp; Most of the work involves a lot of reading of technical documents and then producing a piece of analytical writing about them.&nbsp; This may be arguing with a patent office about why our client&#8217;s invention should be given a patent, it could be interpreting letters from the patent office for a client, or it may be writing a new patent application for an invention that a client has developed.</p><p>From time-to-time we also attend patent office hearings on behalf of our clients either to defend their patents or to attack those of competitors.</p><p>Alongside the technical analytical work, the training aspect of my role means that I spend quite a lot of time discussing work with trainees in the firm and working to develop their skills as patent attorneys to allow them to take the professional qualifying exams.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Intercalation: Have you experienced and observed the increase in innovation in the battery sector, and has a particular emerging technology like silicon anodes, solid-state batteries, lithium-sulfur, lithium-air, etc caught your attention, what do you think things will look like in 5 years?</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>Sam</strong>: Quite a lot of new patent applications are incremental improvements on existing technologies.&nbsp; So it is rare to see totally new concepts in the battery space.&nbsp; However there has been a clear large increase in the overall number of patents filed in the energy storage area (the statistics indicate about a seven-fold increase in the last 20 years and more than doubling since 2010).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Lithium-ion technologies are still clearly the dominant chemistry from a patent point of view outnumbering other chemistries by more than 5 to 1.&nbsp; However we do see some of the more unusual battery systems emerging in the patent literature, such as redox flow cells; and the steady increase in patent applications for solid state electrolytes is indicative of the continued interest in solid state batteries.&nbsp; There is also a lot of research going on into solving the volume expansion issues surrounding silicon anodes and we are starting to see some of that filter through into patent applications.</p><p>In the next five years I think the electric vehicle applications of batteries will likely drive a lot of the research and therefore the patenting of battery technology.&nbsp; So a focus on power density will of course be vital and the attractive electrochemistry of silicon-containing anodes could well lead to their playing a more significant role.</p><p>The other angle that is hugely significant at the moment is the environmental impact of battery technology.&nbsp; We all know that batteries will play a big role in implementation of alternative energy sources, not least to smooth out supply issues.&nbsp; However the impact of the batteries themselves will become a focus.&nbsp; The recent European Commission proposal for regulations controlling the sustainability of batteries with a particular focus on recycling will certainly drive innovation in that area and I would expect to see patents arising in the next five years driven by that regulatory framework.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Intercalation: How would you compare the patenting strategies between large corporations like Panasonic &amp; CATL, compared with smaller startups and University groups? Is it purely a numbers game, and do the financials in protecting IP play a role?</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>Sam</strong>: Ultimately patents are commercial tools; once granted they allow you to stop somebody from using the invention that you have patented.&nbsp; However to get a patent granted and keep it in force in multiple countries is an expensive process.&nbsp; So financial considerations do often drive the patent strategies, irrespective of the size of the company.&nbsp; For smaller companies and research groups, the key is to get the best protection for what may be relatively limited funds; or to push the large costs as far into the future as possible with the aim of finding a suitable licensee or source of investment to fund a broader patent strategy.&nbsp; So smaller companies will often file fewer, more focussed patent applications and may be more tempted to abandon them if financial backing is not available.&nbsp; Larger companies will often have a bigger patent budget and so have the luxury of being able to explore more elaborate strategies.&nbsp; This may involve filing more patent applications (making it harder for competitors to assess the protection that they have and find a way past it), and could include a more aggressive element such as trying to knock-out key patents that may be held by competitor companies to clear the way for their own products to get to market.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Intercalation: If you could wave a magic wand and change something about battery-related IP, what would you change and why?</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>Sam</strong>: It would be great to see some of the smaller companies and university research teams have access to the funding to allow them to pursue a broader patent strategy.&nbsp; We quite often see really interesting inventions being abandoned through lack of funding at the early stages.&nbsp; Of course there is an element of &#8220;survival of the fittest&#8221; here and in some cases abandoning a technology might be the correct decision but there are a number of times when we are told that the funding isn't there for a project when the science still seems really interesting.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Intercalation: What would your advice be for early career battery scientists interested in pursuing a career in patent law?</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>Sam</strong>: The main thing is to keep your interest and knowledge of science as broad as possible.&nbsp; While large battery companies do employ attorneys who only work on battery patents, the more common route into the profession is through a private firm where you will be expected to work on a whole range of technology in a field as broad as &#8220;chemistry&#8221;.&nbsp; So you find yourself drawing on undergraduate knowledge more than specialist technical understanding.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Intercalation: Thank you so much for your insights, Sam!</strong></p><div><hr></div><h3>&#127774;&nbsp;<strong>Thanks for reading!</strong></h3><p>&#128231; For tips, feedback, or inquiries,&nbsp;<a href="mailto:intercalationstation@gmail.com">please reach out</a>!</p><p>&#127760; Follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/IntercalationSt">Twitter</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/intercalationstation">LinkedIn</a>, and our <a href="https://www.intercalation.co/">website</a> for more information.</p><p><em><strong><a href="https://www.mewburn.com/">Mewburn Ellis</a></strong>&nbsp;is the forward-looking European IP firm.&nbsp; We are a business that puts our clients, our people and our values at the heart of everything we do.&nbsp; With more than 150 years' experience in the IP profession, our focus is on providing clear, honest, strategic advice to maximise the potential of IP as an asset and so increase the value of our clients&#8217; business.

density scales as we increase the size of our cylindrical cells from 18650 to 21700 to 4680 cells. The thicc boi 4680 cylindrical cell is well known as Tesla's new tabless next generation cell. Intercalation Station has written on this format from Tesla's announcement&nbsp;<a href="https://intercalationstation.substack.com/p/-intercalation-station-battery-day">before</a>.</p><p>What we can do is easily change the size of the cell while keeping the cellstack electrode properties the same, and keeping the outer casing thickness the same too.</p><h3>18650 Cylindrical Cell Report</h3><pre><code>18650 cell   (cylindrical)

While we&#8217;ve seen price increases for other battery components before (and in fact, <a href="https://intercalationstation.substack.com/p/the-battery-materials-supply-crunch">we&#8217;ve predicted them</a>), lithium is notable in that it can&#8217;t be substituted with a lower cost material (it&#8217;s where the lithium in <em>lithium</em>-ion comes from, after all). Expect prices to get worse.</p><h3>Redwood pivots to making everything</h3><p>Redwood Materials, the battery recycling outfit led by industry darling JB Straubel, has revealed what they plan on doing with <a href="https://intercalationstation.substack.com/p/july-news-roundup">all that money they raised back in July</a>: a little bit of everything. In an interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-14/a-tesla-co-founder-aims-to-build-an-entire-u-s-battery-industry">Bloomberg</a>, Straubel said the company&#8217;s new focus is to produce copper foil and cathode materials in order to move a &#8220;huge chunk&#8221; of battery material manufacturing from Asia to North America.</p><p>The numbers involved are eye-popping. To achieve his chunk-moving goals, Straubel plans to build a billion-dollar, million-square-foot factory that will produce 100 GWh worth of materials annually by 2025 (ramping up to 500 GWh annually by 2030).</p><p>What this means for Redwood&#8217;s recycling business isn&#8217;t clear. The obvious synergies between battery recycling and battery production are something Straubel wants to emphasize, but barring verifiable data, we can&#8217;t be certain recycled materials will make it into the supply chain. Let&#8217;s hope that <a href="https://greenrocks.substack.com/p/how-much-of-your-ev-battery-can-actually">industry-wide battery recycling standards take off</a>.</p><h3>Sila debuts commercial smartwatch battery</h3><p>In more billion-dollar-quasi-startup news, Sila Nanotechnologies (led by ex-Tesla engineer Gene Berdichevsky) <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2021/09/08/sila-nanos-battery-tech-may-bring-cheaper-electric-cars-but-first-a-better-fitness-tracker/?sh=4a6420ac3b79">has announced</a> that their silicon-based anode technology can be found in the delightfully named <em>Whoop 4.0</em> fitness tracker smartwatch.</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/silagene/status/1435646960082452487&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;This is not a promise or a prototype.
