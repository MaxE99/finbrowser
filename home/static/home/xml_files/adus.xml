Retrospective analysis abstracts the feel of the stock in the moment.  I tried to emulate the year to year feel of the company using a combination of significant events and quantitative metrics. </p><p>I&#8217;ll go through a brief business description before describing the company situation before 2017 and at the end of each year. I&#8217;ll give you my assessment on if it&#8217;s a buy at the end of each year. </p><h2>Summary:</h2><p> Zynex started as a bankrupt, defunct company trading Over-the-Counter with multiple red flags. The departure of key competition allowed them to capture market share while the anti-opioid zeitgeist let them keep it. They found a loophole by overbilling insurance companies, but the stickiness of healthcare and abstraction from the end customer allowed them to sustain revenue growth. The price moved in waves as people discovered the stock, it was up-listed, and eventually captured by retail traders. Although valid short reports were published nearly 3 years ago, those thesis took 3 years to play out with multiple people dunking on the author along the way. I would likely not have bought Zynex stock, but the financials were phenomenal  in 2017 when their competition left the market. They traded at less than 1x sales making it a value stock which has rewarded shareholders nicely over time. As Tobias Carlisle points out (57:00), "if it gets too cheap, I'm gonna buy it". Every company has a price: that is value investing. Timing the market swings in Zynex would have been key to maximize returns since the stock violently moved up in short periods of time. </p><h3>Business description: </h3><p>Zynex markets an electrotherapy device for pain management: the NexWave, a trimodal electrotherapy device, which can do interferential current stimulation (IFC), neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). All three are different ways to apply electrical currents to the body used for different indications as explained&#8239;<a href="https://myolyn.com/different-types-of-electrical-stimulation-the-name-game/">here.</a>&#8239;TENS is for pain relief, NMES is for rehab, and IFC is for acute pain. TENS devices are fairly commoditized with a number of copycat products on the market. However, each TENS unit can have a different power level, with prescription TENS units often being more powerful than over-the-counter (OTC) units (similar to prescription pain killers vs. taking ibuprofen). Unlike most pain killer drugs, there is no consensus on the effectiveness of TENS for pain relief (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537188/">link</a>), though it&#8217;s non-opioid nature increases the marketability. Academic literature suggests benefits from TENS stimulation may diminish over time, with some patients experiencing &#8220;worsening pain.&#8221; In addition, &#8220;One universal agreement is that TENS is not a cure for pain conditions or syndromes.&#8221; Zynex sells the device, the electrodes, and batteries (a regular 9V battery) used in the device. Patients are prescribed the device from their doctor and use it at home. The product is auto-billed based to their insurance if covered. The business itself is one product and straightforward. Although they do market a &#8216;blood monitor&#8217;, it was not approved in 2017 and still has no significant sales after 1.5 years on the market. </p><p><strong>MicroCapClub Thread</strong>: The goal of this exercise is to understand the journey of a multi-bagger: not to judge it in hindsight. Hindsight if always 20/20 with uncertainty often abstracted by long time periods. ZYXI is unique because it has a previously active MicroCapClub thread on the company. It&#8217;s one thing to talk to investors about a company&#8217;s history but seeing real-time reactions from savvy investors allows one to better judge the investors&#8217; mindset. It was initially pitched to the club in 2011 as a &#8216;brute sales force story&#8217; since the product has &#8216;no advantage over the competition.&#8217; At the time, a new blood monitoring device is discussed by management, but no results yet from the product. After missing multiple guidance estimates, investors are exasperated with he company realizing ZYXI has minimal operating leverage, so &#8216;they spend $1 on SGA for every $1 of Revenue&#8217;. I&#8217;ll continue to reference any Microcapclub (MCC) comments for the rest of the writeup. </p><p><strong>Let&#8217;s start with the situation in 2017:</strong> Zynex stock is at .30 after-sales dropped off in 2016 due to insurance reimbursement issues. Liquidity issues led the founder to take on personal debt to make payroll. They weren&#8217;t profitable and had repeatedly overpromised and underdelivered. It got ugly in 2014 with the ousting of all board members by the CEO and &gt;50% shareholder, Thomas Sandgaard. In 2016, Zynex shut down an adjacent pharma business, but a major competitor left the TENS market opening a $250m market opportunity for the core business. In fact, both major competitors, EMPI and RS medical, closed up shop (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/empi-closing-mike-price/?articleId=7658657006315130865">link</a>,&#8239;<a href="https://scr.zacks.com/news/news-details/2020/ZYXI-Zynex-Medical--Disruption-Creates-Opportunity-/default.aspx">link</a>) due to dubious billing practices and &#8216;assumptive selling&#8217;. EMPI eventually pays a multimillion dollar fine. Zynex hires the competition&#8217;s sales team to take their market share. The company ends 2016 profitable and growing though still has liquidity constraints. No transcripts exist at this time, but the development is noted in the 2016 10k. </p><blockquote><p>Our largest competitor, Empi, announced the closure of their Empi electrotherapy division. Empi previously held a large share of the electrotherapy market with approximately $250 million in annual revenue&#8230;. We have engaged, both as employees and contractors, 74 former Empi representatives. Our orders have increased from a monthly average of 1,100 in 2015 to 2,100 in 2016.</p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33d4c62b-fddf-4d9d-9644-01f7cd6d6d47_509x490.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33d4c62b-fddf-4d9d-9644-01f7cd6d6d47_509x490.png" width="509" height="490" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/33d4c62b-fddf-4d9d-9644-01f7cd6d6d47_509x490.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:490,&quot;width&quot;:509,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33d4c62b-fddf-4d9d-9644-01f7cd6d6d47_509x490.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33d4c62b-fddf-4d9d-9644-01f7cd6d6d47_509x490.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33d4c62b-fddf-4d9d-9644-01f7cd6d6d47_509x490.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33d4c62b-fddf-4d9d-9644-01f7cd6d6d47_509x490.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p></p><h3>2017: </h3><p>Significant Events: </p><ul><li><p>A CEO letter to shareholders in April is highly bullish on the business as they continue to &#8220;work on the blood monitoring device&#8221;. </p></li><li><p>They get a new CFO in June of 2017.

They talk around it with discussions of &#8220;improving collections and cost controls&#8221;, but no direct mention. Remember, the supplies are commodity electrodes and products, thus it&#8217;s suspicious they can make this much money for them. Even though it wasn&#8217;t explicitly on the thread, MCC investors weren&#8217;t comfortable with a lack of clear explanation on the turnaround. Still it&#8217;s dirt cheap and management tells a good story. At points, they can seem <s>delusional </s>aspirational since they want to shift the &#8220;paradigm of pain relief&#8221; with a commoditized, controversial TENS unit.&nbsp;</p><p>I likely would not have bought the stock in 2017. It has liquidity issues, a promotional CEO and little competitive advantage. I would be perplexed by their recent revenue growth instead of excited about it, though it can be explained by the departure of competition.. However, based on the Q2 results, it turned profitable and trades at a 5x annualized P/E. It&#8217;s ridiculously cheap for the growth. If lucky enough to see the company turn profitable with quarterly results, this was a great time to buy early in the year. </p><p>Side Note: I suggest reading through some Glassdoor reviews from 2017. There are quite a few for such a small company implying people feel strongly both for and against their jobs.&nbsp;Reviews range from unethical billing to excellent sales incentives.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46b21c12-1f3e-4ff9-bc17-387e9d59edd0_1696x591.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46b21c12-1f3e-4ff9-bc17-387e9d59edd0_1696x591.png" width="1456" height="507" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/46b21c12-1f3e-4ff9-bc17-387e9d59edd0_1696x591.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:507,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46b21c12-1f3e-4ff9-bc17-387e9d59edd0_1696x591.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46b21c12-1f3e-4ff9-bc17-387e9d59edd0_1696x591.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46b21c12-1f3e-4ff9-bc17-387e9d59edd0_1696x591.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46b21c12-1f3e-4ff9-bc17-387e9d59edd0_1696x591.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Stock from 2017 -2019</figcaption></figure></div><h3>2018: </h3><p>Significant events:</p><ul><li><p>In May, they announced another $2 million share buyback program after repurchasing 500k shares from the previous buyback program.</p></li><li><p>Inklings of Sell-Side coverage show up on the first-quarter earnings call in May with five total analysts vs. 0 on the Q416 call one year ago.</p></li><li><p>In November, they also announced a special .07/share dividend with Q3 earnings.</p></li></ul><p>The most impressive news&#8230;.. is a lack of significant news.

It&#8217;s tightly held (SandGaard holds 50%) and on the OTC markets so liquidity is constrained. Another MCC stock pitch was posted in December 2018. The pitch essentially says they are growing 50%/year while priced at &lt;10x EV/EBIT. The stock price ends the year flat, but revenue growth is still strong. </p><p>Shares peaked early in the year and couldn&#8217;t match the previous year&#8217;s growth levels thus selling off. Each quarter, they beat revenue guidance and raise estimates. Each quarter&#8217;s movements isn&#8217;t immediate but takes time as constrained liquidity leads to large, volatile movements.

Lots of investors recognize potentially shady dealings with a comment on a seeking alpha article stating, &#8220;ZYXI is dependent on rent-seeking and making sure insurance/government covers their marked-up product via relationships&#8221; (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3474142-zynex-minus-7_1-percent-on-shareholder-offering-from-ceo">link</a>).</p></li><li><p>One can see a slew of seeking alpha articles on the company starting in Mid-April with a total of 10 pieces from April to December (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZYXI/analysis">link</a>). Only one is bearish, which I highly recommend (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4297802-zynex-abusive-pricing-model-unsustainable">link</a>). Night Market Research does extensive research into the pricing model of Zynex, which relies on automatic deliveries of commodity supplies like batteries and electrodes, but the thesis underlying the article is the commodity nature of the device.</p></li></ul><p>Each quarter is a beat and raise with full year results at 45 million and guiding to 80 million. However, device sales still have not reached 2016 levels meaning they have taken share from competition yet still have not sold as many devices. The stock trades on the uplisting news early in the year (up significantly) and insider selling later in the year (mainly the CEO). It doubles through the course of year, but not without volatility moving 20% up to down on little no news. </p><p>There are a number of bullish articles published on the company. Regarding the bullish reports, it&#8217;s impressive to see sentiment follow price. Each article was published AFTER it had hit $7/share and cites competitors leaving the market as a tailwind. For keen observers, these articles are four years past due since those competitors left the market years ago. &nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F137f8668-da43-4f8f-ad22-0ba759c11066_1699x539.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F137f8668-da43-4f8f-ad22-0ba759c11066_1699x539.png" width="1456" height="462" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/137f8668-da43-4f8f-ad22-0ba759c11066_1699x539.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:462,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F137f8668-da43-4f8f-ad22-0ba759c11066_1699x539.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F137f8668-da43-4f8f-ad22-0ba759c11066_1699x539.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F137f8668-da43-4f8f-ad22-0ba759c11066_1699x539.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F137f8668-da43-4f8f-ad22-0ba759c11066_1699x539.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h3>2020:</h3><p>Significant Events &#8211;</p><ul><li><p>Their 1Q earnings are another beat and raise in April. 2020 guidance was 7% more than original estimates. At all-time highs, they file to offer shares.</p></li><li><p>TRICARE (representing 10% of revenue) drops coverage for TENS units in May, the 1st large health plan since Medicare to drop coverage. This follows the trend from the old pharma segment at Zynex selling pain creams as TRICARE was the first to cut reimbursement.</p></li><li><p>In October, the stock was off 25% after disappointing results, likely due to insurers catching onto their pricing model.</p></li></ul><p>Insider selling continues through the year, but some are still buying on the way down (<a href="https://twitter.com/jonahlupton/status/1316418060551585794">link to popular Twitter account,</a>&#8239;October 2020). On the surface, it's a fast-growing MedTech company, but digging one step further reveals a DME supplier trading at &gt;1x Sales extracting value rather than providing it. It doesn&#8217;t take much digging to reveal their product isn&#8217;t unique, especially with well researched short reports out there. They hit 400 salespeople by the end of the year but fail to meet guidance. Sandgaard funded a personal purchase of a struggling soccer franchise in September 2020 (please check out his&#8239;personal <a href="https://www.sandgaardcapital.com/leadership">website</a>) through selling shares. Nothing wrong with taking money off of the table, but odd to buy a struggling soccer team. The MCC thread stops in November of 2020, with most people selling after it hits 20+,but some buying on the way down. After reading the seeking alpha piece by Night Market Research, investors are concerned with possible abusive pricing along with prior history of the company. It&#8217;s a volatile stock doubling from March to July and then being cut in half by October. Surprisingly, COVID didn&#8217;t seem to affect their growth drastically. </p><p>Nothing&#8217;s changed in my eyes. It&#8217;s still a commodity product with a promotional CEO and little to no pipeline. The short reports validates investor discomfort. Still, it&#8217;s cheap on a trailing basis and people have been calling for their downfall for quite a while. We can see it taken for a ride after COVID hits as retail investors really take hold of the name. Looking at the history of the stock, it&#8217;s quite amazing how the trading dynamics were disconnected from potential forward looking results (such as insurance dropping coverage). </p><h3>2021: </h3><p>Significant events:</p><ul><li><p>February Results are at the low end of guidance with a forward guide to $135-150m FY sales and 15-25 million EBITDA, representing 70% growth. They're at 500 sales reps and expect 600 by the end of the year.</p></li><li><p>A $10M share buyback program is announced in March of 2021. It's an odd dynamic where the CEO sells shares while the company is repurchasing them. The CEO acts ridiculous after buying the soccer team, dropping loads of money into it.</p></li><li><p>Guidance this year is continuously adjusted downward with an insurance cut by UNH as the nail in the coffin on December 10th. They limit the number of electrodes per month to 2, which could kill Zynex's profitability. UNH only changed practices after receiving complaints from patients (happened in May 2021,&#8239;<a href="https://www.uhcprovider.com/content/dam/provider/docs/public/policies/mpub-archives/commercial/medical-policy-update-bulletin-february-2021-full.pdf">here</a>). Even after the May update, no analyst asks about the insurance cut on any of the earnings calls. UNH will increase premiums until the cows come home, but they&#8217;re not in the business of paying more money than necessary.</p></li><li><p>In December, they bought another company in what seems like a futile attempt to expand their services.</p></li></ul><p>We see another volatile year with swings up and down as people wait on results. Each quarter is unpredictable, but the trend is downward overall. Don&#8217;t buy a value stock under the impression is a growth stock. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3253dfd-f6fa-4987-82bc-2bf81d29cb15_1721x516.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3253dfd-f6fa-4987-82bc-2bf81d29cb15_1721x516.png" width="1456" height="437" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c3253dfd-f6fa-4987-82bc-2bf81d29cb15_1721x516.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:437,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3253dfd-f6fa-4987-82bc-2bf81d29cb15_1721x516.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3253dfd-f6fa-4987-82bc-2bf81d29cb15_1721x516.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3253dfd-f6fa-4987-82bc-2bf81d29cb15_1721x516.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3253dfd-f6fa-4987-82bc-2bf81d29cb15_1721x516.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><em>Would I buy it?</em>&#8239;&nbsp;So here we are at the end of 2021/beginning of 2022 where the company is up 20x+ in five years, but down 67% from the peak.

They sell to "Medicare Advantage (MA)" plans (primarily). MA plans are a subset of Medicare where insurers are paid by Medicare a set fee per patient. Unlike typical insurance which pays based on services rendered, Medicare advantage plans get a sum from the government per patient. ("Here's your $10k patient, figure out how to make the profits work"). This encourages "value-based care" where insurers will try to minimize costs by preventing expensive hospitalizations. (they receive the same X$ if a patient has surgery or not). The amount per patient that Medicare advantage insurance plans receive per patient is based on risk factors which can potentially lead to higher yearly costs. For example, insurers will be reimbursed at a higher rate for a patient on Dialysis to pay for that care. The risk adjustment factors extend to&nbsp; peripheral vascular disease (aka Semler's test). The payment chain here is Patients pay taxes-&gt; Medicare pays -&gt; Medicare Advantage plans pay -&gt; doctors.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b14bcfc-ffa9-488b-b78b-fc21c9a304e9_1287x728.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b14bcfc-ffa9-488b-b78b-fc21c9a304e9_1287x728.png" width="1287" height="728" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4b14bcfc-ffa9-488b-b78b-fc21c9a304e9_1287x728.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:728,&quot;width&quot;:1287,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Home Risk \nAssessment \nSemler \nprovides Device \nand gets paid, \nPayment can also \nhappen through \nthe H RAs \nPatients \nTesting &#8226; > \npreventive care \nTests patients \nat home (per \ntest fee) \nInsurance \nClinics \nourages \nuse/Owns \nclinics \n(monthly fee) \nMedicare \nPays Insurance a set \namount based on Risk &quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Home Risk

Their top two customers account for &gt;50% of their revenue and have done so for a few years. High customer concentration adds potential risks since any issues at those companies mean slowed growth. However, the customer concentration is the <strong>nature of the market</strong>. The top two Medicare advantage plans are UnitedHealthcare and Humana who hold 26% and 18% market share, respectively. There can still exist risk with respect to pricing power, but the high ROI and ease of use of the product leave no reason for companies to switch products. However, one should still keep an eye on any significant data from customers to track market trends. For example, Humana's slowing MA growth could be a short term headwind for Semler (<a href="https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/humana-halves-2022-medicare-advantage-enrollment-outlook">link</a>).</p><h4><em>Question 2: What is the ROI for Insurers?</em></h4><p>Semler's value proposition to insurers is twofold: the ability to prevent costly interventions and additional reimbursement from Medicare. Recalling the RAF from earlier, a PAD diagnosis adjusts a patient's risk score upward meaning insurers are paid an extra $2800/year to care for a patient with PAD. With this alone, a low cost $50-100/test  can have a positive ROI. Not screening for PAD can almost be seen as giving up $2800/year for high risk populations.</p><p>The second ROI benefit stems from preventing other costly interventions such as stroke and heart attack. Multiple studies say screening for asymptomatic ABI is cost effective assuming a 10% prevalence, in line with the prevalence for those &gt;60. (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1358863X17745371">study 1</a>, <a href="https://evtoday.com/articles/2016-oct/economic-analysis-in-peripheral-artery-disease">study 2</a>, <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circoutcomes.109.930735">study 3</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7808667/">study 4</a>). In higher prevalence populations, screening is even more useful. Let's take an example to demonstrate the possible ROI. A patient has asymptomatic PAD and is put on medication therapy for &lt; $150/year. This delays acute intervention costing the insurance $25,000 for 4 years. For a Medicare advantage insurer, this leads to four additional years of revenue without paying for costly hospitalization. Even the cynic in me likes the product! It&#8217;s a Win-Win-Win</p><p>Where to find the Risk adjustment codes: Medicare releases the risk adjustment factors each year at <a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/updated-2022-benefit-year-final-hhs-risk-adjustment-model-coefficients-clean-version-508.pdf">link</a>. The base Per member per month rate paid to Medicare advantage plans is 10k per member with an additional 2800-3000 for patients with PAD.</p><h4><em>Question 3: Why would doctors and patients want it?</em></h4><p>For patients and doctors, the answer is simple: catching PAD early means delaying severe issues (heart attack, stroke, etc.) Semler's test is 5 minutes and can be performed by anyone. The doctor is paid for&nbsp;a PAD diagnosis test without needing to refer patients out (like a traditional ABI).</p><h4><em>Question 4: What's the TAM?</em></h4><p>About 9 million have PAD in the US with a prevalence of 10% in those above&nbsp; 65% and ranging from 15-30% in those with risk factors (<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(19)30255-4/fulltext">source</a>). The AHA recommends screening everyone above 65 and those above 50 at risk. Though these are the recommendations, the actual TAM is likely smaller because the prevalence decreases for each incremental patient group. In addition, those already diagnosed with the disease won&#8217;t be scanned. 15-20% of 50+ year olds have diabetes (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2017/p0718-diabetes-report.html#:~:text=Rates%20of%20diagnosed%20diabetes%20increased,older%2C%2025%20percent%20had%20diabetes.">link</a>), 40% are obese, and 15% are smokers. Based on this, I'd estimate about 25% of those above 50 are at risk for PAD.</p><p>Let's now look at solely the Medicare Advantage market which has 24 million beneficiaries as of 2020. If we conservatively assume 25% of those patient should be scanned, and a $40/per test fee, the immediate MA TAM is $240 million. This is without the other 37 million patients on Medicare or any others at risk who are 50-65 years old. </p><p>Semler's internal estimates place them at about 10% market penetration indicating sufficient runway for growth in just their core QuantaFlo Product.</p><h4><em>Question 5: Competition?</em></h4><p>The current standard of care is traditional ankle brachial index testing. An ABI takes 20 minutes and requires a referral to another facility using a specialist technician. Semler's Quantaflo test can be plugged in to any laptop and used in a primary care office. There&#8217;s no competition here. </p><p>Other, more accessible,&nbsp; "digital ABI" tests do exist even though Semler's holds some patents through 2027, but the ease-of-use and go-to-market strategy is different. For one, Quantaflo does seem to be the easiest to use/integrate with EHRs In addition, selling to insurers is a novel model exploited only by Semler. A sales rep at a competing company was taken aback when I asked if they sell to insurance companies validating Semler's strategy is unique.</p><h4><em>Question 6; What's Next?</em></h4><p>Semler plays their product investments, both for external and internal ones, close to the chest, but we should receive more information in March on the FY21 call. Even without much detail on new products, I expect these products to be similar diagnostic tests serving chronic conditions and sold to insurers. Strong relationships between Semler and insurers means any new product with a similar function should have an easy rollout.</p><h4><em>Question 7: Sounds too good to be true: what the biggest risk?</em></h4><p>The primary risk to Semler is from MA reimbursement. There are a number of reports including one from the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) criticizing MA for  overpayment. One such article even explicitly named HCC108 (Peripheral Vascular Disease). (<a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/OEI-03-17-00474.asp">OIG report</a>, <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/forefront.20210927.6239/">News Article</a>). With scrutiny on overpayments, insurers may cut back on MA rollouts if the government chooses to reduce risk payments.  </p><p>However, I still Semler is strongly positioned in their core product offering. The OIG report is headlined by chart reviews rather than extra diagnostics. Chart reviews comb through patient records to adjust risk scores (yes it does seem like profit chasing).  Plus the article (and USPTF recommendation) doesn't mention Quantaflo but rather "ultrasound studies". An easier test would likely lead to a revision of screening guidelines. Early diagnosis of PAD is beneficial especially in high prevalence populations and Quantaflo is a key to make that diagnosis seamless. Even if insurers are extracting revenue from the government, PAD testing is set to increase as the country shifts to preventive care. The risk adjustment isn&#8217;t the only benefit for insurers: preventive care saves money too. </p><p><em>The financial case:</em></p><p>At $80, the market is certainly not expecting much. I believe they can reach $130 million in sales by 2026 at 34% Net income margins leading to 44.2 million in Net Income and about $5.75/share. Assigning a 20X P/E multiple (appropriate for <em><strong>mature</strong></em><strong> </strong>Medical device companies), gives us a share price of 110 and a CAGR of 9%. If you believe the multiple should be higher or they can grow faster with additional products, the IRR can be even higher. Simply put, I think it's a low risk 8-20% IRR with further upside based on multiple expansion and new products.</p><p><em>25% growth is conservative???:</em></p><p><em> </em>Some immediately scoff at my description of 25% growth as conservative.  People will cite base rates as why 25% 3-year revenue growth is unlikely (<a href="https://research-doc.credit-suisse.com/docView?language=ENG&amp;format=PDF&amp;source_id=csplusresearchcp&amp;document_id=1065113751&amp;serialid=f2q0vtKOQ202cwIOt6b1kRL6U91EC1rK7zBkPzU1tjI%3D&amp;cspId=null">source</a>), but most studies exclude microcaps and do not breakout companies by sector. Michael Mauboussin breaks growth out by sector and level of sales concluding that intangible asset heavy companies are more subject to large variations in growth. The mean 3 year growth rate for sub $1B (sales) healthcare companies is 19% (standard deviation 52%) (<a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/im/publication/insights/articles/article_theimpactofintangiblesonbaserates.pdf">source</a>). Heaps of shitty companies with unsustainable growth rates give investor a playing field with lots of opportunity. Semler is uniquely advantaged in a growing field, so 25% is conservative in my opinion. </p><p><em>Waiting for a fat pitch: </em>In my opinion, Semler isn't a 'fat pitch' with 500% upside in 4 years. It is, however, a strong RR with an above average IRR using conservative estimates. Even in a risk off world, Semler's profitability provide a floor on the stock price.</p><h1>2021 Results</h1><p>2020 returns: 91.48%</p><p>2021 returns: 3.48%</p><p>Q4 returns: -18.04%. </p><p>Positions as of 2/01/2022</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a235020-e9e0-4403-b7f7-2d354ddb7213_1218x920.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a235020-e9e0-4403-b7f7-2d354ddb7213_1218x920.png" width="1218" height="920" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6a235020-e9e0-4403-b7f7-2d354ddb7213_1218x920.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:920,&quot;width&quot;:1218,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:103974,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a235020-e9e0-4403-b7f7-2d354ddb7213_1218x920.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a235020-e9e0-4403-b7f7-2d354ddb7213_1218x920.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a235020-e9e0-4403-b7f7-2d354ddb7213_1218x920.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a235020-e9e0-4403-b7f7-2d354ddb7213_1218x920.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The last three months have NOT been easy, but if I was in it for the money, I would have quit a long ago. I&#8217;m in it because I love the game. Regardless of if I win or lose, I&#8217;ll continue to love it. </p><p>Here&#8217;s to a better rest of the year!</p><p><strong>Portfolio thoughts:</strong></p><p>This is the part I always skip to in fund letters so let's go over it. The positions I have in which I'm paying the most attention are PFMT, SMLR, and NEPH. All three are different setups, but poised to have an important 2022.</p><p><strong>PFMT - </strong>I still believe PFMT is under valued based on it's future results, but after missing estimates in Q3, the market has been scared off. Based on guidance of 80M in revenue and what I expect is 10M in EBITDA, shares are fairly valued for a mature company at 15X EBITDA. The market is pricing in no growth. In addition, I believe the revenue earned in Q3/Q4 is set to return as Omicron subsides in Q122. The missed guidance is a result of delayed, not canceled, revenue, setting up 2022 to be a flagship year. I could be wrong and the slowdown might be a result of competitive advantage losses, but investors aren't paying much for future growth anyway.</p><p><strong>NEPH- </strong>A smaller position initiated in Q4 was Nephros, a maker of water filters primarily for healthcare facilities. In 2017, the company saw a step change in demand when new legislation increased the use of filters in hospital systems to prevent legionella. New legislation mandating stricter compliance could boost their demand similarly in 2022. I expect Q4 pain as the Omicron surge overwhelmed hospitals, but 2022 could be a banner year. The CEO guided to 30% growth in 2022, but I believe this is conservative. I'm worried about the profitability, but recurring revenue from filters replaced every 6 months gives me comfort. They have multiple shots on goal (or are spread too thin depending on your perspective) and want to reach profitability in the core filter business this year. I encourage those interested to watch the CEO&#8217;s MCC presentation and read the most recent shareholder letter. </p><p><strong>CMPD - </strong>Compumed is a profitable, growing, tele-diagnostic company trading at a dirt cheap multiple. It provides remote diagnostics to organ procurement organizations and prisons (mainly) allowing these organization to make diagnoses without a doctor on site The niche market has one other competitor and little information is released, but it&#8217;s an interesting company given the price. It trades at &lt; 15x P/E and seems to be growing at 10-20%/year. They&#8217;re investing into the product and could re-accelerate growth. </p><h2>GENERALISTS VS SPECIALIST INVESTORS</h2><p>When I started investing, I believed whole heartedly in a generalist mandate for the best performance possible. A go-anywhere investor's universe is multiples larger than one who&#8217;s mandate is defined by one specific sector. Trevor Scott of Tidefall Capital compared it to knowing one neighborhood well vs travelling the world visiting many places. Who wants to stay confined to their local neighborhood if one can traverse the world?</p><p>The increased investment universe mitigates any sector rotation risk. Energy investors have certainly had tougher time over the last 10 years compared to software investors. Why struggle trying to find the best companies in a poor sector instead of investing in the sector with the best returns? It can drastically improve your base rate.</p><p>Generalization is lauded in other areas of life, especially after the release of David Epstein's book "Range: Why Generalists win in a Specialized World". Epstein separates situations into kind and wicked ones defining kind environments as those with known rules where we can reliably predict situations while wicked environments are constantly changing without defined rules. He argues that wicked environments favor generalists drawing on broad experience to reason into a solution.</p><p>Eliot Turner references this book in a podcast when discussing the benefits of generalist investing. Investing is a wicked environment where stock movements are driven by hidden, often unexplainable, phenomena. Stocks have no rules. Generalization allows investors to apply mental models across sectors while an abstraction from "industry experts" allows one to question the status quo. Industrial Auto investors could never have predicted or capitalized on the shift to EVs. However, some sectors (as we'll discuss) do favor specialists. (<a href="https://moiglobal.com/twiii-s1-e9/">link</a>)</p><p>To summarize, being a generalist investor is favored for a number of reasons:</p><ol><li><p>They have a larger investable universe thus more stocks to choose from</p></li><li><p>They don't have risks of underperformance due to sector rotation</p></li><li><p>They can apply mental models across businesses and sectors</p></li><li><p>It&#8217;s simply more fun</p></li><li><p>Iconic investors are often generalists (think Buffett, Greenblatt, lynch).</p></li></ol><p>Keeping in mind the aforementioned benefits of generalization in markets, specialist fund managers can be preferred if one wants to perform the sector allocation yourself.</p><p>Benefits can extend to beyond the logistical. Sector-focused funds in private equity tend to outperform generalists (<a href="https://www.stableam.com/specialist-jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none/">link</a>). In addition, an academic paper on the topic concluded specialists were better stock pickers while generalists were better market timers (<a href="https://www.rsm.nl/fileadmin/home/Department_of_Finance__VG5_/PAM2016/Final_Papers/Rafael_Zambrana.pdf">link</a>).</p><p>Not only do sector specialists tend to&nbsp;outperform when picking stocks generally, and data suggests specialists in out of favor sectors can still beat the broad market. Sure, a SaaS specialist could have easily outperformed the S&amp;P in recent years, but J. Mintzmeyer at Value Investor's edge prove it's possible to outperform the market even in a poorly performing sector (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/checkout?service_id=mp_316">link</a>). They focus on shipping/energy stocks and have compounded capital at 41% over the last five years outperforming both the S&amp;P (17% CAGR) and the shipping industry (1% CAGR). There are also a number of healthcare focused funds I follow such as Orbimed, Perceptive Advisors, and Deerfield. Although generalists are in the spotlight, specialist managers both exist and can outperform. It's counterintuitive to Epstein's thesis. I'd propose that investing, although wicked, can require specialization for certain fields and for certain people.</p><p>There are two reasons for specialization</p><p><strong>A) lack of time to do deep research into all sectors:</strong> For individual investors like myself, the amount of research needed to understand an industry can be too much. Who has time to talk to customers, compile industry reports, etc trying to learn about multiple sectors? Individual investors are better suited to "invest in what they know", thus naturally leading to specialization.</p><p><strong>B) Certain sectors are difficult for generalists:</strong> The best example is healthcare/biotech. The complex system combined with irregular risk profile of stocks dependent on science, reimbursement, and  psychology lends itself to sector specialists. In addition, once a network of industry experts is cultivated,&nbsp; research happens exponentially faster. Expert interviews alleviate some burden, but a personal network provides more timely and trustworthy opinions.</p><p><strong>Which one is better?</strong></p><p><strong>It depends.</strong></p><p>Individuals often follow a pattern: starting off as generalists until they learn just how little they know. They turn to a niche where they might have an edge and gradually work their way across companies and if possible: additional sectors. Shifting your focus to one industry sacrifices short term profits for sector-specific knowledge, but I'd argue it&#8217;s worth it become a true expert.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Don't try to drive and kiss a pretty girl at the same time: you'll do neither one well.</strong></em></p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a2e1e51-ec13-4ad6-9e19-a14b616388c3_602x426.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a2e1e51-ec13-4ad6-9e19-a14b616388c3_602x426.png" width="602" height="426" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5a2e1e51-ec13-4ad6-9e19-a14b616388c3_602x426.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:426,&quot;width&quot;:602,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;What do you call a psychological phenomenon where you know enough about a  topic to think you know more than most people but insufficient to understand  how little you actually know? -&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="What do you call a psychological phenomenon where you know enough about a  topic to think you know more than most people but insufficient to understand  how little you actually know? -" title="What do you call a psychological phenomenon where you know enough about a  topic to think you know more than most people but insufficient to understand  how little you actually know? -" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a2e1e51-ec13-4ad6-9e19-a14b616388c3_602x426.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a2e1e51-ec13-4ad6-9e19-a14b616388c3_602x426.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a2e1e51-ec13-4ad6-9e19-a14b616388c3_602x426.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a2e1e51-ec13-4ad6-9e19-a14b616388c3_602x426.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>I would argue a similar principle applies for professional investors. Rather than starting with a broad mandate, they should begin with one sector or niche and work their way across the investment world. They have the time and resources and exploit inefficiencies in all ends of the market, but only if they&#8217;re willing to spend time cultivating a broad network and building sector specific knowledge.</p><p>Summary and Practical takeaways:</p><ol><li><p>Specialization is better for certain industries</p></li><li><p>Individual investors are better as specialists due to time constraints.</p></li><li><p>Specialists can outperform even in times of broad sector underperformance.</p></li><li><p>Generalists have their place, but would benefit from deep understanding of specific industries.</p></li></ol><p><strong>The Unspoken Advantage of Individual Investors:</strong></p><p>Another topic which I'd like to touch on is an unspoken advantage of individual investors. It&#8217;s not the oft-cited long term time horizon, but the financial comfort and constant cash flow from a primary occupation. For investors whose livelihood are made and lost on the markets, internal and external psychological forces can pressure people into poor decisions. Investing in stocks becomes easier with a consistent influx of cash. It&#8217;s the Buffett-Gardner model. Warren Buffett and David Gardner are both great investors (with different styles) who have a diversified income stream through other businesses. A constant income stream combined with appropriate financial decisions (not yoloing your 401k into shiba inu coins) allows opportunistic buying and no sleepless nights. Cash flow means #neversell can be a viable strategy if new money is allocated to the appropriate opportunities. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Q3 portfolio

While there was the usual buffet of financial news ranging from supply chain disruptions to the Evergrande crisis, my portfolio (and the markets) ran in place. In fact, though I may be up 20% for the year, the gains largely came before March.</p><p>My portfolio for 2 quarters have been extensively boring with respect to overall price action, but this range-bound lack of volatility need not be confused with passivity. It's a time of continuing diligence, consuming relevant news, and evaluating new companies. As a part-time investor with the technical analysis skills of an ape and a desire to concentrate my portfolio, the bar to clear for any company to enter the portfolio is often high. It takes time to understand a company enough to be comfortable to enter into a sizable position. Even then, the timing may be early so I'll spend months waiting for the market to realize a thesis. In the intervening time, I do little but more research. One can go months without finding a good company or my stocks moving significantly. It's boring.</p><p>This is why 2-4 year, concentrated investing is difficult. One can neither get the dopamine hit of constant trading nor the flexibility afforded by 'forever' time periods. I'm constantly researching with minimal dopamine payoff.</p><p>Investing this way can feel Sisyphean. For the uninitiated, Sisyphus was cursed by the gods to roll a boulder up a hill only for it to roll back down, for all eternity. Akin to Sisyphus, I often research new companies only to find the stock unattractive. The rock rolls back down the hill. We start again. But I find solace in this often fruitless endeavor because each hill I climb accumulates my investing knowledge, preparing me to climb another one.</p><p>Even if tedious, my endeavors are distinct from Sisyphus because there is a light at the end of the tunnel. We find a stock which lights up our eyes and satisfies every criteria. It's why I can tolerate quarters such as the most recent one with little price action to keep me occupied.</p><p>The middle half of 2021 was a series of hills climbed. Eventually, the markets will recognize the underlying value of the businesses. Do not confuse boring returns with inactivity and do not let boredom push you away from doing the work. Keep searching for the next investment, doing continuing diligence, even if it feels futile in the moment.</p><p><strong>Portfolio Review:</strong></p><p>Key Add: Tremor International (TRMR)</p><p>Tremor Is an end to end ad tech platform housing both an SSP and a DSP focused on Video/CTV advertising.

The business history isn't clean with the former CEO even implicated in fraud dealings ( though I would unrelated to the current business).&nbsp; In addition, they reclassified their revenue last year to recognize net instead of gross revenue (total money going through the platform) leading to a drop in sales. The temporary drop in revenue looks bad for anyone screening through companies without digging deeper. It was an AIM-listed company and people may not trust buying a foreign company. They listed on the NASDAQ to close the valuation gap but the stock hasn't moved since the listing.</p><p>I often overthink investments, but I don't want to overthink this one. Fast growing player in a hot space held down for arbitrary reasons. Multiple revaluation should be the first driver of stock returns while continued growth will be the second. They will continue to use piles of cash to acquire companies to build a more complete platform. The margin of safety is high given the low relative valuation. The thesis is simple and straightforward</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8b1f998-5da4-410f-9c5d-0f722a1a2bc6_675x499.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8b1f998-5da4-410f-9c5d-0f722a1a2bc6_675x499.png" width="675" height="499" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c8b1f998-5da4-410f-9c5d-0f722a1a2bc6_675x499.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:499,&quot;width&quot;:675,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8b1f998-5da4-410f-9c5d-0f722a1a2bc6_675x499.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8b1f998-5da4-410f-9c5d-0f722a1a2bc6_675x499.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8b1f998-5da4-410f-9c5d-0f722a1a2bc6_675x499.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8b1f998-5da4-410f-9c5d-0f722a1a2bc6_675x499.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><strong>$SMLR Update:</strong> Semler Scientific remains one of my largest holdings even after the recent 25% drop. Their home testing market had some demand pulled forward into the first half of the year which hurt their 3Q earnings (specifically from their 2nd largest customer). Management commentary wasn&#8217;t clear and could worry some investors, but it is still short term noise. They have always viewed the business as a YoY business. I expect their flagship product, QuantaFlo, to continue to perform well in the coming years as they become standard of care. </p><p>However, a response to a question about deceleration within their current customer base is concerning. It is natural to expect a deceleration in growth as each incremental patient tested naturally leads to a lower ROI. Essentially, it&#8217;s easy to identify which patients benefit the most, but the next patients are harder to identify.  I plan on talking to management to see what thoughts they have on this front. </p><p>They have signed a contract for one of their ancillary products which keeps them on track for a late 2021/early 2022 rollout as expected. Gah, patience is a bitch. </p><p>Ultimately, I&#8217;m not a buyer on the dip because it&#8217;s still at &gt;10x sales, but they continue to perform well and execute on expansion plans. I find it hard to sell a business growing 40% a year at 30X EV/EBIT, especially with a long runway for growth. </p><p><strong>What I'm Watching:</strong></p><p>Fund letters are often a great source of new ideas, but since I publish my exact holdings and write about most companies I own, I'm going to try something slightly different. I have a list of companies I'm watching but I haven't pulled the trigger on. Let's go through a watchlist</p><p><strong>#1: Basic Fit (BFIT),Gym Owner in Europe: </strong>When I hear someone smart discuss a company in an industry I know, I get interested. I initially became interested in the company after reading David Polansky's <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/az8oiqfapcg0ocy/Immersion%20Investment%20Partners%202Q%202021%20Letter.pdf?dl=0">letter in July 2021</a>. Adam Wilk then wrote about the company on his <a href="https://www.greystonevalue.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Greystone-Capital-Q3-2021-Letter.pdf">Q3 investor letter</a>. Gyms are a great business to own since people rarely churn. They're essentially a tax on people's desire to be fit.&nbsp; The margins are high and the runway to growth is long. Based on a valuation laid out by both investors based on continuing gym openings and per gym profits, the stock has serious upside.</p><p><em>Why don't I own it? </em>Not enough diligence. I need to do more work on the name to own it. Specifically, I want to learn more about the company history, the European market for gym goers and the quality . In addition, I need to model out future growth for myself for a sanity check<em>.</em></p><p><strong>#2: Nephros (NEPH), Water Filters For Hospitals: </strong>The company was growing 50%+ before COVID which hit them pretty hard given their primary customers are hospitals. Insiders own a significant chunk and the company has introduced a new of products&nbsp; which nicely complement the water filters. New laws requiring water filtration in hospitals benefitted the company for the past couple years but there is still room to grow</p><p><em>Why don't I own it? </em>With 50% gross margins and at 8x sales, I'm concerned about the valuation. In my opinion, they are limited in the possible profitability due to the gross margin.&nbsp; I'm waiting for the stock to drop for it to become a 'fat pitch'. This could certainly come back to bite me as an error of omission.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9964aea7-ba81-4656-ac89-e2d29add5c91_500x500.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9964aea7-ba81-4656-ac89-e2d29add5c91_500x500.png" width="500" height="500" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9964aea7-ba81-4656-ac89-e2d29add5c91_500x500.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:500,&quot;width&quot;:500,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9964aea7-ba81-4656-ac89-e2d29add5c91_500x500.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9964aea7-ba81-4656-ac89-e2d29add5c91_500x500.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9964aea7-ba81-4656-ac89-e2d29add5c91_500x500.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9964aea7-ba81-4656-ac89-e2d29add5c91_500x500.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><strong>#3: Lee Enterprises (LEE), Legacy Newspapers Transitioning to Digital: </strong>Plenty has been written on Seeking alpha about the company so I encourage you to look at that. It&#8217;s a newspaper company with a growing digital subscriber base. There is an absolute metric ton of debt though management believes it is manageable with current operations. I have read poor reviews about the company's assets, but local news is a tough business. If it can repay the debt and morph into a digital first company, they have the opportunity to be a multi-bagger.</p><p><em>Why don't I own it? </em>Owning a melting iceberg like local newspapers means there isn't as much margin for error. Valuation isn't demanding, but I'm unclear on the dynamics of local news and how much of their digital subs can grow. I need to model out debt repayment as well to become comfortable owning it.</p><p><strong>#4: Interpace Diagnostics (IDXG), Molecular diagnostics for Pancreatic and Esophageal Cancer. </strong>It&#8217;s owned by renowned investor Peter Kamin and recently restructured becoming increasingly profitable. They brought in a new CEO and acquired a business which sells to pharma companies. With less than a 3x EV/Sales and a large TAM, this looks like an amazing stock though competitive advantages of the different tests are unclear. They recently received and increase in reimbursement which positively impacted revenue for the pancreatic testing segment.</p><p><em>Why don't I own it? </em>Their new tests are unproven and there are competing tests for the main pancreatic cancer product. In addition, I've tried to contact the companies multiple times with no response at all. Their products need more validation for insurance reimbursement though having strong private equity (Ampersand and 1315 Capital) and public markets (Kamin) investors lends them some credibility.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Stereotaxis ($STXS), A baby Intuitive Surgical?]]></title><description><![CDATA[A turnaround story looking to emulate Intuitive Surgical's success.

For my first deep dive, I wrote about Intuitive surgical, the Behemoth of surgical robotics. It&#8217;s an 80B company which has handsomely rewarded shareholders for 20 years. Even though the surgery done by Intuitive machines is different, we can draw parallels between Intuitive and Stereotaxis given they have a similar business models and growing pains. If you believe Stereotaxis can follow in&nbsp; Intuitive Surgical footsteps, there is a long runway for compounding with an extremely high moat. In fact, I would argue Stereotaxis is the better investment right now given potential for growth, relative valuation, and future improvements in the business.</p><h2><strong>Selling Coat Racks: the story from the IPO.</strong></h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ccc3532-8ed7-445f-8b0d-d4c45a9f5cd7_500x500.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ccc3532-8ed7-445f-8b0d-d4c45a9f5cd7_500x500.png" width="360" height="360" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3ccc3532-8ed7-445f-8b0d-d4c45a9f5cd7_500x500.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:500,&quot;width&quot;:500,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:360,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&#8226; INTUITIVE SURGICAL \nMom, can we have \nROBOTIC \nNo. There is \nSURGERY COMPANY \nHome \nROBOTICSURGERY \nAt home... &quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="&#8226; INTUITIVE SURGICAL

The technology wasn't ready for commercial use with terrible user experience and large upfront costs. Hospitals realized no one was using this $1.5 million dollar system (which required a new hospital wing) so they stopped buying it. While the Da Vinci system found a use case with prostatectomies, Stereotaxis struggled to find a niche to champion their system.

Fischel is from DAFNA capital management, a hedge fund specializing in healthcare, and saw an opportunity in Stereotaxis to grow a business with great potential. He's managed Stereotaxis into a cash-rich, debt-free company ready to capitalize on a new wave of innovation. Stereotaxis operates with a minimal operating loss and $43M in cash. He demonstrated his leadership on Q3 earnings call. He mentioned potential opportunities in China and announced a deal with Microport EP to sell systems in China around a month later. Such behavior is characteristic of effective and reliable management.</p><p>Fischel may not be an industry veteran or a founder/CEO, but he is an experienced business analyst who knows medical technology. While we're taking a look at Fischel's tenure, we can also analyze his enigmatic and somewhat controversial <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1289340/000149315221004715/ex99-1.htm">compensation package.</a> Fischel hasn't taken a salary since joining the company and the compensation plan ties his compensation to the total market cap of Stereotaxis.</p><blockquote><p><em>"To meet the first milestone, Stereotaxis&#8217; market cap must increase to $1 billion. Vesting of each of the remaining milestones is contingent upon Stereotaxis&#8217; market capitalization continuing to increase in additional $500 million increments. Thus, full vesting of the award is contingent upon Stereotaxis&#8217; market cap increasing to $5.5 billion. The award is designed to provide Mr. Fischel with approximately 10% equity ownership in Stereotaxis on a fully diluted basis if this highest threshold is accomplished."</em></p></blockquote><p>Each 500m threshold will reward Fischel with 1% of the company in new shares. Modelling a compensation package after Tesla's Elon Musk is controversial with some pointing out misaligned incentives to pursue M&amp;A fueled by stock (increased share count and same share price). However, anyone who has followed Fischel more closely would understand such tactics aren't likely. He manages operating losses well, doesn't over promise, and likely doesn't need the extra money (given he didn't take a salary when he joined the company). I trust Fischel and like the compensation package. In the unlikely scenario we see signs he is taking advantage of the compensation package, I am willing to change my mind.</p><h2>Interventional Cardiology</h2><p>Before I describe the business model I want to review interventional cardiology and how it&#8217;s a different from other types of surgery.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F238dd08c-358f-4a6d-b050-79784490edcd_1566x1175.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F238dd08c-358f-4a6d-b050-79784490edcd_1566x1175.png" width="484" height="363" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/238dd08c-358f-4a6d-b050-79784490edcd_1566x1175.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:484,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;ROBOTICS TRANSFORMING SURGERY \nOpen \nSurgery \nLaparoscopic \nSurgery \nEndovascular \nSurgery \nMAKO \nMazor \nRobotics \n&#8226; >800 Installed Systems \n&#8226; sloo.ooo Procedures,'vear \n&#8226; Billion Acquisition in 2013 \n&#8226; Million Revenue in 2013 \n&#8226; >2CO Installed Svstems \n&#8226; Billion Acquisition in 2017 \n&#8226; -$65 Million Revenue in 2017 \nMam Others Competing or Investing to Compete: \nINTJi11VE \nVERB \nURI \n&#8226; Installed Svstems \n&#8226; Procedures,year \n&#8226; >S60 Billion valuation \n&#8226; Billion Revenue \n&#8226; Billion Acquisitions in 2019 \n&#8226; Negligible Revenue when Acquired &quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="ROBOTICS TRANSFORMING SURGERY

Endovascular surgery includes ablations, interventional cardiology, and other interventional applications. Endovascular surgery requires navigation of flexible and winding blood vessels often with rigid catheters. Physicians have to manually navigate these wires through blood vessels from a far off location (directing from the groin up to the heart). Navigational devices must balance rigidity for navigation and flexibility for safety. However, Stereotaxis' magnetic navigation can use a flexible catheter to navigate the vessels which improves safety.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ca2addd-8541-4d60-8f85-6c7de80fb458_288x299.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ca2addd-8541-4d60-8f85-6c7de80fb458_288x299.jpeg" width="288" height="299" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1ca2addd-8541-4d60-8f85-6c7de80fb458_288x299.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:299,&quot;width&quot;:288,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;AFIB Mini-Maze : Arrhythmia Surgery&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="AFIB Mini-Maze : Arrhythmia Surgery" title="AFIB Mini-Maze : Arrhythmia Surgery" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ca2addd-8541-4d60-8f85-6c7de80fb458_288x299.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ca2addd-8541-4d60-8f85-6c7de80fb458_288x299.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ca2addd-8541-4d60-8f85-6c7de80fb458_288x299.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ca2addd-8541-4d60-8f85-6c7de80fb458_288x299.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><em>Ablation</em>: Ablations are used to treat Arrhythmias i.e. irregular heart beats (quite literally, your heart can skip a beat). An ablation uses energy to burn part of the heart to stop it from beating abnormally. A catheter (just a device at the end of a wire) is inserted into distant vessel and threaded&nbsp; to the heart (see image). It relies on the mechanical skills of a doctor to push the catheter through blood vessels without tearing them. Once the catheter reaches the heart, the doctor must effectively administer energy to heart tissue to ablate (burn off) the right tissues with constant contact of the heart tissue. By ablating (killing) some tissue, the heart will stop beating irregularly. Stereotaxis' navigation is primarily used in ablation procedures.</p><p>For the Stereotaxis, it is important to distinguish different types of arrhythmias. An arrhythmia is an irregular heart of any kind, but it can originate in different locations in the heart. Atrial fibrillation (AF), ventricular fibrillation (VF) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) are all different types of arrhythmias with different treatments and diagnoses. Depending on the arrhythmia, robotic navigation can be more or less useful. Robotic surgery is more helpful for VT, VF, and complex AF since those procedures are more complex.</p><p><em>Other Interventional Procedures: </em>Other interventional procedures in cardiology and neurology use a similar surgical approach where a wire is inserted through a vein far from the intended interventional area and guided manually. Sample procedures using interventional approaches include carotid artery stenting (stents to open up blood vessels) and clearing blood clots in the brain.</p><h2><strong>Business Model: Razors and Razor blades</strong></h2><p>Stereotaxis has a similar business model to Intuitive surgical with upfront system sales and revenue from each procedure. They sell multiple products: a robotic navigation system, a visualization tool called Odyssey Cinema, model S X-ray imaging system, and disposables for each procedure.</p><p><em>Magnetic Navigation System: </em>Stereotaxis markets two robotic systems: the Niobe and Genesis. The Niobe is their legacy system while the Genesis is the new system released just last year. A robotic navigation system costs $1.5-2.0 million upfront and requires a hospital to build a separate wing to house large magnetic fields from the robot. The differences between the Niobe and Genesis system are subtle but innovative. The Genesis system is smaller, easier to install, and quicker to maneuver. The Genesis can be installed with a regular fluoroscopy (X-Ray) system to perform standard procedures so hospitals don't have to build a wing solely for Stereotaxis. One problem with the Niobe system were the 5-7 second delays between ablations as a result of the technology, but the Genesis cuts this delay down by 80%+. <em><strong>EDIT: Based on conversation I had, the delays were 5-7 seconds, but software has reduced this lag down to one second which genesis further reduced by 80%.</strong></em> However, construction still requires a new wing and is expensive. (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3606509/">source</a>)</p><p><em>Odyssey Cinema: </em>Beyond their navigation system, they also sell Odyssey Cinema, effectively a hub for physicians to monitor physiological details, visualize patient anatomy, and navigate catheters remotely (from another room). The system allows procedures to be recorded and displayed either in real time or on playback.</p><p><em>Model S Imaging system:</em> The largest issue for installing a new Stereotaxis system is the construction requirement. For a new Niobe system, a hospital must build out an extra wing to house magnetic shielding equipment solely for the Niobe. While surgical robots for thoracic surgery (think ISRG) can be used in any operating room, a Stereotaxis system uses large magnets which requires shielding. Stereotaxis attempts to reduce this startup friction by selling a complete X-ray imaging system along with the RMN robot (the Model S imaging system). This allows hospitals to use the Stereotaxis system without dedicating a new wing to only robotic procedures. The new wing can do standard and robotic procedures if needed. The total cost of construction is the same as a regular X-Ray lab + the cost of a Stereotaxis robot, but doesn't require additional building costs.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Disposables: </em>The primary disposable is the QuikCAS disposable. Stereotaxis also receives a royalty from J&amp;J for cases where that catheter is used. However, STXS is developing a catheter in-house (expected next year) to increase per procedure revenue and improve catheter performance. A catheter designed specifically for robotic navigation will perform better than a similar one designed for manual navigation and outfitted with a device to make it compatible. Mapping systems are developed by multiple companies and used to give doctors a map of anatomical structures to monitor the procedure in real time.

For more complex cases such as Ventricular Tachycardia, robotic navigation can actually decrease the time of procedure because of the complexity of ablation. Operator training is an important factor to consider for procedure timing. Although common perception is that robotic surgery is longer, experienced centers have skills/techniques to reduce procedure times (<a href="https://www.dicardiology.com/article/time-take-another-look-robotics-electrophysiology">source</a>). As better techniques are developed, efficiency will continually increase (~15:00 in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaTIxg3gT7I">video</a>) and increased training reduces procedure times. One RMN advocate, Dr. Tirok, developed efficiency techniques and a training program which replicated his results. Automation of movements is another potential solution for longer procedure times.</p><p><em>Pro: Constant Contact</em>: Constant contact with cardiac tissue, key for ablation, is easier to achieve robotically than magnetically. See the video below for a visual of the difference between robotic and manual navigation</p><p><em><a href="https://www.roboticep.com/toolkit/OldPhysiciansVideos/Catheter-Stability-Comparison.mp4">https://www.roboticep.com/toolkit/OldPhysiciansVideos/Catheter-Stability-Comparison.mp4</a></em></p><p><em>Pro: Cognitive Surgery: </em>Navigating through a tortuous set of blood vessels requires extensive mechanical skill. Robotic Magnetic navigation shifts skill to the mind of the doctor rather than the mechanical abilities. When a doctor uses RMN, they are separated from the patient and navigating like a video game player thus it takes little mechanical skill compared to manual navigation.</p><p><em>Pro: Less X-Ray exposure: </em>The doctor also incurs much less radiation with robotic navigation. When an electrophysiologist sits in an EP lab to perform an ablation, they receive a great deal of radiation exposure and shielding equipment creates long term orthopedic issues (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5034914/">Source</a>). With remote navigation, a doctor is in a separate room. It's hard to imagine a doctor switching back to the physically demanding manual navigation after transitioning to the less demanding, less damaging robotic navigation. Some younger doctors may find pride in doing manual navigation, but the toll of a standard EP lab builds over time.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c1b993e-3bbc-497f-b2a1-a3802e6802e7_796x694.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c1b993e-3bbc-497f-b2a1-a3802e6802e7_796x694.png" width="404" height="352.23115577889445" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4c1b993e-3bbc-497f-b2a1-a3802e6802e7_796x694.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:694,&quot;width&quot;:796,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:404,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c1b993e-3bbc-497f-b2a1-a3802e6802e7_796x694.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c1b993e-3bbc-497f-b2a1-a3802e6802e7_796x694.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c1b993e-3bbc-497f-b2a1-a3802e6802e7_796x694.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c1b993e-3bbc-497f-b2a1-a3802e6802e7_796x694.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><em>Con: Added Costs: </em>Total costs for robotic ablation of atrial fibrillation is about double compared to manual ablation coming in at 12,000-15,000 dollars(assuming a 1200 case 6 year depreciation period for the robot). The actual disposables for Stereotaxis in each case cost ~$1500 (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3606509/">source</a>). If we look at 2019 numbers, they received ~$26M from disposable revenue. With an installed base of 123 systems doing ~100 procedures per year, the disposables revenue per case to stereotaxis is ~$2100, in line with the scientific article plus any royalty fees. Adding a mapping system for the surgeon adds 3-7k per case. Robotic navigation is cheaper than other advanced interventions but still fairly expensive. I couldn't find many sources of information on VT vs regular ablation (a major market opportunity for Stereotaxis), but return on costs for robotic is higher for VT.</p><p><em>Pro: Less Complications: </em>&nbsp;Does robotic navigation lead to better outcomes? The short answer is yes, but only if one is trained well on the system. As with procedure times, increasing training increases decreases complications. Intuitively, the robotic system should lead to better outcomes because of increased comfort for the surgeon, advanced automation techniques, and catheter design (magnetic catheters are soft rather than hard so there is practically no risk of perforation). However, proficiency in roboic navigation takes time and can be frustrating. Still. many studies have shown a reduced rate of complications</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ca43288-c2aa-4251-917d-fd5a8766e274_1550x1088.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ca43288-c2aa-4251-917d-fd5a8766e274_1550x1088.png" width="508" height="356.5769230769231" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8ca43288-c2aa-4251-917d-fd5a8766e274_1550x1088.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1022,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:508,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Appendix: \nMajor Adverse Events \nCommon Maior Adverse Events: \nCardiac perforation \nAV block \nowe \nMajor bleeding \nDeath \nAE svT VT \ncompuing RMN (gray) of 2012-2020. \nStudies which did rot data tor adverse events' Sot no major in either groupe \nAE = Contraction. \navg \nReduction&#8226; \n4.12% \n1.16% &quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Appendix:

Both have downsides and do not represent a serious threat to the platform Stereotaxis is building. The Amigo System is intended only to perform remote navigation so surgeons do not receive any radiation exposure. It's basically manual navigation from another room so the technology is severely limited. Not to generalize, but their website doesn't inspire confidence (<a href="http://catheterrobotics.com/about.htm">Website</a>). Sensei X is owned by a large company, Auris Health, with a founder experienced in robotic surgery (Fred Moll, Co-founder of Intuitive), but still has some issues. While the Stereotaxis uses magnetic navigation and pulls the catheter, the Hansen system pushes the catheter intending to mimic a surgeon's original movements. Sensei is more portable, responsive, and easier to learn but there is little mechanical difference between it and manual catheter navigation. A Stereotaxis system is more automated with mechanical advantages. (<a href="https://a-fib.com/remote-magnetic-navigation-systems/">source</a>)</p><p><em>Anti-Arrhythmia Drugs: </em>Another form of competition is indirectly from anti-arrhythmia drugs. Historically, drugs were used to treat arrhythmias, but these led to high rates of recurrence (the irregular heartbeat returns) coupled with lots of side effects (<a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circulationaha.111.019927">source</a>). Ablation was an underappreciated and understudied intervention since its invention in 1987 until the late 2010's. Now, ablation is <a href="https://www.hrsonline.org/guidance/clinical-resources/2017-hrsehraecasaphrssolaece-expert-consensus-statement-catheter-and-surgical-ablation-atrial">recommended</a> for most cases of AF and new evidence is emerging on the effectiveness of ablation for VT (<a href="https://www.tctmd.com/news/vt-no-matter-its-source-benefits-early-catheter-ablation-pause-scd">source</a>). Ablation is widely used for AF and I expect VT to follow in its footsteps. For example, ablation procedures increased by 10x over the past 20 years in Sweden with AF being the primary driver (100x more ablations for AF). VT ablation is in the middle stages of adoption and will follow a path similar to AF as ablation is widely adopted.</p><p><em>Pulsed field Ablation: </em>The third bucket of competition are new technologies which increase procedure efficiency without requiring robotic navigation. Pulsed field ablation is a new innovation which could revolutionize the ablation industry. The technology selectively ablates cardiac tissues and makes procedures shorter, easier, and safer. It essentially abstracts the need for robotic navigation because it provides similar benefits.</p><p>However, PFA is only currently available for AF, so the VT market (where Stereotaxis dominates) is still open. One<em> </em>Electrophysiologist I spoke to even commented that PFA may have some mechanistic issues for ablating VT. I messaged David Fischel about PFA and he responded with a couple key points: A) PFA will take time to grow (5-10 Years) B)Robotics may turn out to be more important with PFA because of a requirement for constant contact, and C) a PFA catheter could easily be used/developed with Stereotaxis. I could see PFA abstracting the need for robotics in the short term, but I don't believe that robotics won't be the future. I see PFA as merely one roadblock to accelerating adoption.</p><p>Stereotaxis is a near monopoly with an increasingly effective solution and will likely play a large role in the future of endovascular surgery</p><h2><strong>Total Addressable Market</strong></h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6656ddfb-3642-440e-85dc-e753ca1d3e51_1575x1208.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6656ddfb-3642-440e-85dc-e753ca1d3e51_1575x1208.png" width="1456" height="1117" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6656ddfb-3642-440e-85dc-e753ca1d3e51_1575x1208.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1117,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;INNOVATION DRIVING GROWTH \nElectrophysiology Labs \nPerforming Cardiac Ablation \nRobotic \nSystem \nSales \nIncrease in Annual Market \nOpportunity \nProprietary \nAblation \nCatheter \n$10B+ \nMultiple Multi-Billion Dollar \nEndovascular &amp; Endoluminal \nMarkets TO Be Addressed \nNew \nClinical \nApplications &quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="INNOVATION DRIVING GROWTH

The systems TAM is relatively straightforward. With 4,000-5,000 EP labs, the total TAM could be 8-10B ($2m system sale). However, a robotic system isn't warranted for every lab. I would expect ~20% of labs eligible to buy a system (costs and system requirements) putting the system TAM at 1.6-2B. Obviously, the new genesis system increases their addressable market by integrating a fluoroscopy solution (normal X-Ray), but there is still plenty of greenfield opportunity any way you slice it. Upgrades to the system which can be expected every 8-10 years provide 160m-250m in annual opportunity.</p><p><em>Disposables: </em>Stereotaxis receives ~$1,500 in disposables per procedure and $300 in royalties. They perform about 100 procedures per system with an installed based of a little over 100 systems. In 2020, there were 360k ablations&nbsp; in the US (240k AF, 120k other, <a href="https://www.hmpgloballearningnetwork.com/site/eplab/us-ep-labs-losing-500-million-each-year-due-underutilized-reprocessing-programs">Source</a>). Based on a number of conversations, the split between regular AF and complex AF/VT is about 55/45 meaning there are ~162k US patients where robotic navigation shines. Given there are about equal numbers of EP labs in the US and abroad, we can assume the worldwide TAM is double and concentrated in developed countries. Overall, STXS has only ~1.5% market share. Even if we assume they aren't used for regular AF procedures, they are less than 5% penetrated. At $2000 per case, the worldwide TAM is $648m based just on VT.</p><p><em>The new Catheter: </em>Stereotaxis is developing a proprietary ablation catheter for use in robotic surgery. Instead of outfitting a standard catheter with their disposable set for navigation compatibility (from 2008), the in-house catheter is designed for robotic navigation and solves issues with navigation while increasing revenue per procedure. Each catheter will add $2500 in (high margin) revenue per case since they will receive all proceeds for the catheter instead of $300 in royalty fees. This means the TAM for just complex arrhythmias and VT shoots up to 1.3B worldwide. Originally expected later this year, approval is now set for 2022 in Europe and 2023 for the US (supply chain and manufacturing issues)</p><p><em>Increased need for Ablation: </em>Those may underestimate the total market opportunity if we look out 5-10 years. There were an estimated 33 million people with AF in 2010 affecting 2-6 million in the high income countries. The prevalence of arrhythmias is only expected to increase over time as developing countries gain access to new diagnostic technologies and wearables improve awareness of arrhythmias. As Russell peters commented &#8220;people in Africa haven&#8217;t heard of lactose intolerance&#8221;. Arrhythmia is an issue for those privileged enough to worry about (or have an Apple Watch to diagnose it). Awareness of such a disease will only increase over time (<a href="https://cdt.amegroups.com/article/view/31223/30169">source</a>)</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9194055-8c1e-4af3-9c51-ca17def89f42_225x225.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9194055-8c1e-4af3-9c51-ca17def89f42_225x225.jpeg" width="225" height="225" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a9194055-8c1e-4af3-9c51-ca17def89f42_225x225.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:225,&quot;width&quot;:225,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;dopl3r.com - Memes - Doctor You have an arrhythmia.

The model of sticky system sales and high margin recurring revenue is a useful heuristic when valuing STXS.</p><h4><strong>Numbers to the Story</strong></h4><p>I rarely model a full DCF and would much rather know which metrics matter and which metrics I can predict so let&#8217;s start with the metrics that matter</p><p><em>Systems sold and the total installed base:</em> The revenue from each incremental system sold isn't as important as the total installed base. The company expects $11 million in system revenue for the 2021 and double that for 2022 driven in equal parts by system upgrades and greenfield systems. For 2021, there will be 7 total systems with 5 greenfield systems and for 2022, Fischel estimates low to mid teens systems sold. Overall, there is ample opportunity for new systems if they can get over the mental block some EP labs may have when buying a Stereotaxis system. New system sales in a large medical center in China is encouraging since Chinese medical centers may have less biased view on Stereotaxis and choose to make decisions on data instead (Source: Q2 transcript)</p><p><em>Procedures per system:</em> The average number of procedures per system is currently ~100, but this number has lots of room for upside and is largely skewed towards some heavy users. For example, the new Genesis systems have a procedure run rate of 200/year and represent &#8220;power users&#8221; of the system. With an average of 100/year, this is only one procedure per three days meaning there is plenty of opportunity to perform more procedures robotically.</p><p><em>Revenue per procedure:</em> We know the current revenue per procedure is around $2000, but with the introduction of an in house catheter, that should jump up substantially, possibly to 4000.</p><p><em>Margins on those revenues:</em> The margins on systems sales changes from year to year and obsolescence charges can even make the system gross margin negative (they have to write off inventory which counts as a loss). However, if we look at historical numbers, we can expect system sale margins of 40-50%. Recurring revenue has gross margins of ~85%. Overall, if Stereotaxis can scale procedures, EBIT margins can reach 30%.</p><p>We can build a fairly simple model out to 2025: If we assess only VT market, we can expect Stereotaxis to dominate. With 120,000 VT procedures, let's say they capture 40,000 of these procedures in 4 years, a fast but reasonable 21% growth rate from 2019 numbers. If we assume they grow their installed base to 160 from 110, this requires 250 procedures per system, also reasonable. Placing a 10x sales multiple on the 140m (assuming 3,500/procedure) high margin recurring revenue, the MC is 1.4B, a 36% IRR with 300% upside.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3a578d3-0999-41ea-8415-2362ef7544af_528x347.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3a578d3-0999-41ea-8415-2362ef7544af_528x347.png" width="528" height="347" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f3a578d3-0999-41ea-8415-2362ef7544af_528x347.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:347,&quot;width&quot;:528,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Tota I Procedu res \nRevenue per Procedure \nProedure revenue 2025 (000's) \nSales Multiple on procedure rev \nMarket Cap \nIRR for 4 years \nprocedure growth rate \nInstalled Base \nprocedures per system \n40000 \n3500 \n140000 \n10 \n1400000 \n36%l \n22% \n160 \n250 &quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Tota I Procedu res

Pulsed field ablation could simplify all ablations and reduce the utility of RMN.

Still these cuts are mainly for AF and VT ablation reimbursement was cut by 5%. VT ablation remains difficult so reimbursement is high.</p><p><em>Adoption of New Systems</em>:&nbsp; Adoption hinges using innovation and published data to clear the bas taste hospitals have in their mouth. Unlike IBM, people will most certainly get fired for buying a Stereotaxis after a history of underuse. In addition, doctors hate switching from the status quo if unnecessary. Further, young doctors may not understand the toll of manual navigation, thus find little use in the slower, harder to set-up Stereotaxis system. In addition, proud doctors believe they can perform any surgery adequately without any help. 99% of doctors believe they are above average (no source, just a hunch).</p><h2>Growth Opportunities</h2><p>Three stand out to me: improved margins allow increased sales expenses, automation and collaborative surgery, and further improving outcomes.</p><p><em>Margins allowing for more sales people:</em> With the current margin profile and responsible nature of Fischel, Stereotaxis is limited in their marketing activities. With a new catheter, the incremental revenue will allow them to assign one sales person to each hospital, a more common system, which would drive even more growth.</p><p><em>Automation &amp; Collaborative surgery:</em>&nbsp; Stereotaxis' goal is make surgery cognitive rather than mechanical. By accumulating data, they can start to automate parts of surgery. The collected data can be used to improve surgery by providing feedback to doctors. Telesurgery is hyped, but completely remote surgery is difficult to execute with minimal benefits. Instead, Stereotaxis is pioneering collaborative surgery where surgeons can consult experts remotely during surgery. It may not apply during every case, but it could prevent complications in tough cases.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Outcome improvement:</em> Robotic surgery will only get better over time. As they introduce innovations with new catheters and upgraded systems, patient outcomes will improve. At some point in the future, it may well be irresponsible for doctors not to use RMN for complex ablation.</p><h2>Putting it all together</h2><p>We have company which came public without the right technology to commercialize effectively. A new CEO kickstarted innovation pointing toward a brighter future if they can execute. If you missed the boat on $ISRG, $STXS could be the next robotic surgery giant.</p><p>Disclosure: I own a small amount of shares, willing to add on execution and/or stock continuing to drop.

Currently, the device isn't reimbursed by Medicare Part B and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) doesn't have an established fee for the device. Without a fee schedule, each device is reimbursed differently and insurance approval isn't standardized. Signing on new insurance companies takes time and most approvals require appeals. An established fee schedule changes the picture in multiple ways: It increases awareness among providers and patients so customer acquisition cost decreases. Insurances authorization becomes easier so the time needed to authorize a patient decreases. Less time in the backlog is less churn. Easier authorization also means less people-power and reduced SG&amp;A costs.</p><p>Myomo withdrew their application to change the coding classification for the MyoPro which would make a Medicare Fee Schedule easier. This was no fault of Myomo but rather a result of a changing administration. Myomo had applied under a proposed rule change to change their device classification but the rule change was delayed with a new administration, thus Myomo withdrew the application. Management expects CMS to re-propose the rule (which allows them to ask for a reclassification of the device) in the next few months. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77ef681d-b87d-4a4b-b265-3d0601731217_1203x224.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77ef681d-b87d-4a4b-b265-3d0601731217_1203x224.png" width="1203" height="224" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/77ef681d-b87d-4a4b-b265-3d0601731217_1203x224.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:224,&quot;width&quot;:1203,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:66504,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77ef681d-b87d-4a4b-b265-3d0601731217_1203x224.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77ef681d-b87d-4a4b-b265-3d0601731217_1203x224.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77ef681d-b87d-4a4b-b265-3d0601731217_1203x224.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77ef681d-b87d-4a4b-b265-3d0601731217_1203x224.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The rule then needs to be approved after which Myomo can re-apply for a benefit classification change. </p><p>The MyoPro is classified as Durable Medical Equipment (DME) like a bed or CPAP machine and reimbursed with a capped rental (13 month rental after which the patient owns it).

The cost to acquire a patient and transition them to backlog has to be less than 9k&nbsp;(~.12&nbsp;adds per 1k spent).&nbsp;</p><p><em>How will they get there?</em> Myomo has numerous tailwinds but it hasn't shown up in the numbers&#8230;yet. </p><p><strong>Returning to the three paths to profitability:</strong></p><p>A) Decrease SG&amp;A per customer which can either come from less advertising (Word of mouth/becoming Standard of Care) or decreasing costs required for insurance authorization. Myomo continues to sign on new insurance plans and 80% of patients in the pipeline at the end of Q2 had plans which previously authorized the device. As more people are approved for the MyoPro, the friction for the next approval will decrease. </p><p>B) reduce churn/quarter to improve high conversion rate. I don&#8217;t expect churn per quarter to decrease substantially, but there are some levers to pull. If Myomo can encourage patients to stay with a quicker authorization process, some impatient people may not churn out of the pipeline</p><p>C) shorten time from entry to authorization thus decreasing the impact of churn. This metric is seasonal, but the most recent quarter showed an acceleration in the time from patient acquisition to backlog conversion. 14% of the pipeline were converted to revenue and Myomo had it's highest number of revenue units authorized and delivered in a single quarter. This is once again reliant on insurance familiarity with the product. </p><p>An established&nbsp;Medicare Fee Schedule would dramatically change the picture but improved reimbursement conditions (as awareness increases) could lead them to profitability even without coverage/fee schedule. Timing the shift to profitability is difficult, but tracking some key metrics is important to ensure they are on the right path. </p><p><em><strong>Key Metrics: </strong></em>Conversion rate from Pipeline to revenue, Churn, time to from entry to authorization, first time approval rate, CAC</p><p>The equation I used to calculate unit level profitability is as follows: Cost to add to pipeline * churn per quarter * number of quarters &lt; (Profits after Cost of Goods sold (Gross margin) + R&amp;D expense) * average selling price.&nbsp; It accounts for what I think are the major factors and you can modify it as you see fit.&nbsp;</p><p>If any readers have insight into how Myomo is going to achieve profitability, I would love to hear it. Any critiques of my approach are also welcome. </p><p>One pitfall of my approach is the potential delay in operating metrics. Patients acquired into the pipeline now won't show up in revenue for 6 months so the current cohort of acquired patients could be profitable, but it won't show up until later, given how spending in the most recent quarter supports revenue for the coming 2 quarters. </p><h2>Further Questions:</h2><p>What is the split in SG&amp;A expense between marketing cost and authorization cost? Patient acquisition cost is harder to bring down that patient authorization cost in my opinion. </p><p><strong>What changes the first-time acceptance rate and where does it need to be to see profitability (currently at 10-15%)?&nbsp;The first time acceptance rate is the percent of patient not requiring additional appeals. I didn&#8217;t touch on this during the post because the outcome of an increased first time approval rate is reduced SG&amp;A costs. However, the first time approval rate is the building block of many of the key metrics tracking insurance acceptance of the product. </strong></p><p>What is the timeline for Medicare submission and approval? An uncontrollable factor but it would be nice to have a timeline in mind given they withdrew the application</p><h2><em>My position: </em></h2><p>I still hold my original position from when I originally wrote about it. My cost basis is ~$13. Myomo was included into the Russell Microcap index and awareness of the stock is rising (2 recently issued research reports with PTs of $36 and $17). They have a JV in China to sell the device as well as initially successful European operations (10% of sales). With a large addressable population and nearly monopolistic solution for regaining arm function, I find it hard to sell at &lt; 5x EV/Sales. </p><p>Hiring at Myomo hasn't stopped so I don't expect SG&amp;A costs to decrease substantially, but the company is working hard to increase awareness of the device. Inflection points such as profitability, becoming standard of care, and Medicare coverage still lay ahead for Myomo.</p><p>The most dangerous words in the english language are supposedly "This time it's different", but the situation has shifted in Myomo&#8217;s favor. Myomo has a history of burning cash and diluting shareholders, but all tailwinds are in their favor to reach profitability with continued growth. This is a company that becomes better as it get ramps. </p><p>If they can execute, I could see a $525M Market Cap in 5 years (1500 Units * 35000 * 10x Sales multiple = MC of 525 Million). This is still only 40% revenue growth. If they reach profitability with minimal dilution that is a ~$87 stock. This also leaves some room for dilution if we believe revenue growth will persist (With 10m shares outstanding, it would be a 52$ stock in 5 years and they would have raised ~$40M in cash assuming $10/share). I could also see them at the exact same place in 5 years if demand slows down for the product and they continue to burn cash, but I find this scenario unlikely. </p><p>I like asymmetric bets with room for revenue growth and multiple expansion. Myomo is one of them. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66892d74-0ab7-493f-a97e-b6bc3d69032d_687x500.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66892d74-0ab7-493f-a97e-b6bc3d69032d_687x500.png" width="687" height="500" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/66892d74-0ab7-493f-a97e-b6bc3d69032d_687x500.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:500,&quot;width&quot;:687,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66892d74-0ab7-493f-a97e-b6bc3d69032d_687x500.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66892d74-0ab7-493f-a97e-b6bc3d69032d_687x500.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66892d74-0ab7-493f-a97e-b6bc3d69032d_687x500.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66892d74-0ab7-493f-a97e-b6bc3d69032d_687x500.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><div class="footnote" id="footnote-1"><a href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>Pipeline refers to patients who have engaged with Myomo and are in the process of being evaluated and getting insurance authorization.

The mechanism of organ rejection was unknown, so most organ recipients didn&#8217;t survive past 30 days, but the recipient in this case lived for 8 years post-transplant (since they were twins)! Through years of research, physicians discovered better ways to perform transplantation and the mechanisms behind recipient rejection. Wikipedia has a useful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation">timeline</a> of key developments. </p><p>However, cold storage remains the gold standard for transporting organs though one shouldn't mistake the simplicity with complete ineffectiveness. Cold storage is cheap and developed protocols are highly efficient leading to nearly 150,000 transplants <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/398645/global-estimation-of-organ-transplantations/">worldwide in 2018.</a> Yet limitations remain. The primary limitation of cold storage is ischemic time of organs where the organ is receiving no blood flow.&nbsp; Cold storage means ischemic time starts immediately post donation and ends with transplantation limited the potential distance one can travel to get donated organs. A secondary concern is an inability to donate less than perfect organs. While not an inherent limitation of cold storage, many organs can go unused due to imperfect donor characteristics and differing guidelines for donation. </p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3646108-1bcd-4874-ac2a-62175ae68148_300x300.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3646108-1bcd-4874-ac2a-62175ae68148_300x300.png" width="300" height="300" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f3646108-1bcd-4874-ac2a-62175ae68148_300x300.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:300,&quot;width&quot;:300,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:36196,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3646108-1bcd-4874-ac2a-62175ae68148_300x300.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3646108-1bcd-4874-ac2a-62175ae68148_300x300.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3646108-1bcd-4874-ac2a-62175ae68148_300x300.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3646108-1bcd-4874-ac2a-62175ae68148_300x300.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Acceptable Cold Ischemic Times of <a href="http://liveondonate.com/donation-guide/organ/acceptable-ischemic-times">Organs</a></figcaption></figure></div><p></p><p>Transplantation is an effective treatment for end stage organ failure, but a lack of supply has limited our ability to use it. </p><p><strong>Enter Transmedics</strong></p><p>Transmedics was founded in 1998 by the current CEO, Waleed Hassanein, who saw the limitations of organ transplant technology firsthand during his residency at Georgetown in 1994. He took the leap to create his own company, building the first prototype out of parts from <a href="https://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/172607/Egypt/Politics-/Egypts-Waleed-Hassanein-chosen-in-Foreign-Policys-.aspx">a local hardware store</a>. The road to here was difficult yet straightforward: they ran clinical trials and refined the device en route to FDA approval. </p><p><strong>The Technology</strong></p><p>Transmedics' deice is the Organ Care System (OCS) for transporting organs. The OCS uses warm perfusion to extend the lives of donated organs. While cold storage simply transports the organ on ice, Transmedics flushes a warm solution akin to blood ("perfusate") through the organ to reduce ischemic time. Using such an approach has several proposed advantages beyond reducing ischemic time. Transplant teams can measure physiologic metrics allowing quantitative evaluation of organs and the OCS has potential to deliver drugs to organs and improve organ quality. Although other companies use perfusion methods to transport organs, Transmedics' Organ Care System is the furthest developed. Both the perfusate and device design are unique to Transmedics. The OCS is a platform technology to increase organ utilization. The investor presentation lays out increases in organ utilization. </p><p><strong>Two types of donors</strong></p><p>There are two types of organ donation: donation after brain death (DBD) and donation after circulatory death (DCD). DBD means the patient is declared dead in the brain, but the organ continues to be perfused (cardiac output is maintained while the transplant team preps the organ). DCD refers to donation after the heart has stopped beating so perfusion stops immediately. DBD donors are preferred since the organ is perfused for longer, but the number of DBD donors have declined as treatments for brain injuries have improved. DCD donation guidelines for the Lung and Liver are more stringent and DCD hearts aren't accepted with cold storage (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjaed/article/11/3/82/257079">source</a>). The organ care system is key to increase utilization of DCD organs as the supply of DBD organs decreases. </p><p><em>Note on the Opioid crisis: </em>The opioid crisis was surprisingly a boon for organ donation due to increased supply of organs. Someone who dies from an overdose at 35 has quality organs. (<a href="https://www.sts.org/media/news-releases/opioid-epidemic-increases-number-organs-available-transplant">source</a>)</p><p><strong>Business Model</strong></p><p>Transmedics sells their OCS in an all-too-familiar razor/razor blade model where hospitals buy a reusable organ care system console and single use disposables for each surgery. While traditional cold storage is essentially free, the OCS console costs ~$270k and disposables cost ~$45k/surgery. (<a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/advice/mib86/chapter/the-technology">source</a>) Each organ has approximately equivalent costs per disposable. </p><p>Summary of overall advantages: </p><ul><li><p>Increased usage of organs </p></li><li><p>Decreased ischemic times </p></li><li><p>Ability to monitor organs</p></li></ul><p>Disadvantages: </p><ul><li><p>Increased cost</p></li><li><p>Upfront training required on the system</p></li><li><p>Extended criteria organs may have worse outcomes </p></li></ul><p>The story is at an inflection point with expected approval for the heart and liver upcoming and Lung fully commercialized. Given each organ has different specifications, use cases, and approval, it is prudent to look at each organ independently. </p><h1>Clinical Data: Lung, Heart, and Liver</h1><p><strong>Each organ is in a unique step of commercialization with distinct clinical data. </strong></p><p><strong>Lung Clinical data and approval</strong></p><p>The Lung organ care system is the farthest along in terms of commercialization with full <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/recently-approved-devices/transmedics-ocs-lung-system-p160013s002">FDA approval</a> for extended criteria donor lungs and regular lungs. Lungs are theoretically the ideal organ for DCD donation because they can tolerate a lack of circulation given an adequate supply of oxygen yet utilization is still very low (20-30% of donor lungs). The organ care system increases utilization to 87% (EXPAND Lung Trial). However, the organ care system has yet to demonstrate superior results transporting the same organs as cold storage (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-019-05568-3#ref-CR7">source</a>).</p><p><strong>Heart Panel + Expected Approval</strong></p><p>OCS for Hearts is a hotly contested issue with what I would call a fairly contentious panel meeting on the topic in April. In the end, it was recommended for approval by a narrow margin but there were a number of legitimate concerns. </p><ol><li><p>OCS uses lactate as a measurement for heart function, yet this is unproven (even Dr Schroder says it can be useless in this video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejxXGSDMeGQ">32:30 mark</a>)) </p></li><li><p>The Expand trial had no control arm  with both sides presenting good arguments on ethicality and feasibility of such an approach (the FDA did recommend to Transmedics to have a control arm yet Transmedics didn't have one). </p></li><li><p>If the device is approved for a broad label, indication creep may lead it to being used in situations where cold storage has equivalent or better outcomes. It&#8217;s still unclear if the OCS is better for hearts currently being transplanted (better      donors with short ischemic times). </p></li><li><p>The Duke center performed many of the transplants and results were slightly better for the top notch Duke team. </p></li><li><p>The 12 month survival on the transplant list is 3% (overall about 6% mortality considering those that drop for various reasons) and 1 year survival in the EXPAND study was 85%. While overall, 30% of the list dies waiting, it may be worse for some to take an extended criteria heart in terms of 1 year survival. Longer term data would likely prove a transplant better in terms of survival. This      point isn't great and ignores the artificial constraints hospitals place on transplant lists (discussed in the TAM section)</p></li><li><p>Transmedics presented cardiac related mortality as a key metric (0% cardiac complications), but the FDA was more interested in all cause mortality which was different. </p></li><li><p>The panel was also anal about study design, but I felt concerns were overblown and missing the forest for the trees. More hearts means more saved lives even with lower survivability </p></li></ol><p>If you want to waste a Saturday afternoon, I suggest reading through the transcript on the FDA panel website <a href="https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/april-6-2021-circulatory-system-devices-panel-medical-devices-advisory-committee-meeting">here</a>. The panel voted, albeit by a narrow margin, positive on every question of safety, efficacy, and benefit-risk. I won't belabor the panel discussion since FDA approval is expected so soon. The most legitimate concern brought up is mortality with extended criteria hearts. One expects worse hearts to lead to worse outcomes even if the OCS is better than cold storage simply because of the quality of the heart. It may not hinder approval since survival is so good for transplant patients, but not all hearts will lead to acceptable outcomes. This point is discussed later. </p><p>FDA approval will likely happen by the end of September and I expect it to restrict the device usage to extended criteria hearts with ischemic times greater than 2 hours though FDA approval could happen for all DBD hearts. </p><p>DCD trials are ongoing with a supplementary FDA submission expected in 2022. A supplementary submission is an add on approval to a currently approved device. Results are encouraging (based on Dr. Jacob Schroder's comments) so I expect approval. Expanding the indication to DCD hearts would be a game changer since DCD hearts aren't used at all right now. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb14556b6-3694-4363-a661-1bdfdf8acadb_500x500.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb14556b6-3694-4363-a661-1bdfdf8acadb_500x500.png" width="500" height="500" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b14556b6-3694-4363-a661-1bdfdf8acadb_500x500.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:500,&quot;width&quot;:500,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:402781,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb14556b6-3694-4363-a661-1bdfdf8acadb_500x500.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb14556b6-3694-4363-a661-1bdfdf8acadb_500x500.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb14556b6-3694-4363-a661-1bdfdf8acadb_500x500.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb14556b6-3694-4363-a661-1bdfdf8acadb_500x500.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Panel does not equal Approval</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>Liver Panel + Expected Approval</strong></p><p>The liver program is in a similar position as the heart with approval expected in the coming two quarters. Similar to lungs and unlike hearts, DCD livers are sometimes used and approval for the OCS in extended criteria livers means approval for both DBD and DCD livers. </p><p>The liver OCS is different than the other two because it seems to demonstrate <em>superiority </em>rather than just non-inferiority. The liver PROTECT trial demonstrated superior outcomes in terms of for both primary(early allograft dysfunction) and secondary outcomes (LT biliary complications). Surprisingly, survival was the same in both arms so some surgeons may not believe in superior outcomes. The Liver FDA panel was much less contemptuous with near unanimous positive voting results across the board. </p><p>Though the FDA doesn&#8217;t always heed the advice of the panel (@aduhelm), I expect full approval for the OCS in Livers. The superiority results have clinicians especially excited and Transmedics was voted the top presentation at the American Transplant Congress (<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/transmedics-announces-presentation-of-ocs-liver-protect-trial-results-and-is-recognized-as-winner-of-the-peoples-choice-award-for-most-impactful-presentation-at-the-american-transplant-congress-atc-2021-301308345.html">source</a>)</p><p><strong>Improving the system: </strong>The progress the OCS has made since 2018 is notable for the liver program.

However, one must dig deeper to answer whether not demand matches supply. </p><p><em>Artificial constraints</em>: Hospitals manage down their transplant waiting list for better optics.. A hospital's reputation is compromised if 70% of people on waiting list die while on it. For most organs, transplantation is the best option for end stage organ failure to extend lifespan. Transplantation is often indicated for end stage organ failure in younger patients (&lt; 60-70 yrs old) where survival is maximized. </p><p><em>Transplants for Lungs: </em>Current indications for lung transplants boil down to the following: expected survival at 2 years less than 50% due to a variety of lung based diseases including COPD and Cystic Fibrosis. From 2012 to 2017, the number of lung transplants increased as people with more severe diseases were place on the waiting list to match an increased number of donors (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.15677">source</a>). Science around transplantation continues to improve, but long term mortality is relatively constant given the worse recipient profile of those being placed on the waiting list and nature of complications (<a href="https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-an-overview/abstract-text/26454740/pubmed">source</a>). Median mortality is 6.2 years and if one survives past 1 year, the mortality is 8.3 years (vs &lt;50% survival at 2 years). The literature is sparse for cost-effectiveness (let me know if you know of one), but the rubber will meet the road eventually for choosing other treatments. Transplants won't be the best therapy for each incremental organ as both recipient and donor organ quality worsen. The timing of transplantation is key and other therapies that exist for the same indications will impact demand for transplants (<a href="https://err.ersjournals.com/content/29/157/190132#sec-5">source</a>). The uncertainty around the exact number of people worth transplanting makes estimating the real TAM difficult. However, given the total number of people with end stage lung failure, the TAM shouldn&#8217;t be a near term issue. It may not be 66k/year, but it is multiples larger than the current 5k. </p><p><em>Transplants for Heart: </em>Heart transplants is indicated for end stage heart disease and holds greater acceptance among surgeons than transplantation in the lung. The current strategy is to screen patients for a transplant and use a Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) as either a bridge to transplant (because of a supply shortage) or as the final treatment (if they don't qualify). (<a href="https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/ten-points-to-remember/2015/06/11/15/05/left-ventricular-assist-devices-a-rapidly-evolving-alternative">source</a>). However, survival is actually better for those placed on the waiting list, even without using the 'bridged' approach (<a href="https://www.practiceupdate.com/content/wait-listing-for-heart-transplant-vs-lvad-alone-for-advanced-heart-failure/99389">source</a>). Only 9k LVADs are placed per year in the world, though estimates for patients ineligible for medicative therapies for ESHD can be as high as 250k (<a href="https://labblog.uofmhealth.org/rounds/despite-improved-survival-lvad-patients-face-high-infection-rates">source</a>). A recent article highlights ~50k patients eligible for LVAD/transplants. (<a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2018/06/13/the-past-present-and-future-of-the-device-keeping-alive-carew-thousands-of-hf-patients">source</a>) and another points out 125-250k eligible for LVAD or transplantation (<a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.313574">source</a>). The main takeaway is this: Demand <em>drastically exceeds </em>potential supply and acceleration of growth will be fast since transplants are recognized as an effective treatment. </p><p><em>Transplants for Liver: </em>With nearly 17k liver transplants/year and the 67k potential donors, verifying the TAM is less of an issue as scarcity of organs is still the major limit on transplants (there is less a difference between current transplants and potential demand). End stage liver disease affects nearly 5.5 million people and causes 40,000 deaths per year. Transplantation has a significant survival advantage <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4229716/">(source)</a> and would be used more often if given the opportunity. </p><p><em>Bottom Line: </em>Transplantation is an effective treatment for end stage organ failure and severely limited by supply of organs. Skeptics may argue demand doesn&#8217;t match potential supply, but the number of people with organ failure vastly outnumbers organ donors. Transmedics has a monopoly on incremental (extended criteria) organs in the heart and the liver, where demand and clinical acceptance of transplants are the greatest. Need for transplants is evidenced by demand matching an increase in supply (due to the opioid crisis and better transplant methods).</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81e547c3-ddfc-411e-962b-b77983e628d7_266x357.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81e547c3-ddfc-411e-962b-b77983e628d7_266x357.png" width="266" height="357" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/81e547c3-ddfc-411e-962b-b77983e628d7_266x357.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:357,&quot;width&quot;:266,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:173584,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81e547c3-ddfc-411e-962b-b77983e628d7_266x357.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81e547c3-ddfc-411e-962b-b77983e628d7_266x357.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81e547c3-ddfc-411e-962b-b77983e628d7_266x357.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81e547c3-ddfc-411e-962b-b77983e628d7_266x357.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h2><strong>Other Commercial Factors</strong></h2><p><em>Capacity for Transplants: </em>The speed of acceleration hinges not only on potential demand, but also the capacity to transplant more organs. Even though Transmedics can sell a million systems a year, I would theorize the current transplant infrastructure is insufficient to meet such a stark increase in demand. The National Service Program (touched on next) mitigates this potential ceiling by training people on the OCS. However, both transplant centers and the number of transplant surgeons will cap potential growth in the total number of transplants. Initial rollout will certainly be amazing, but if most current organs stay with cold storage (a natural assumption given hospitals want to maximize profits) extended criteria transplants are key for Transmedics. Increasing the total pie will lead to capacity constraints.&nbsp; Where does this ceiling exist? I don't know but expecting the number of transplants to triple in 5 years is unreasonable. See this <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/supply-isnt-the-problem-with-organ-transplants-11575644400">article</a> on a potential shortage of transplant surgeons from a director at Transmedics, David Weill. </p><p><em>National Service Program:</em> The National Service Program is Transmedics' attempt to accelerate adoption by flexing their first to the field, multi-organ nature. It provides centers with assistance transplanting organs with their own clinical experts. The NSP reduces people power needed from the hospital, a major barrier to adoption, and further integrate the organ care system into hospitals. When I spoke to someone at a lung transplant program, he noted the lost person-hours spent retrieving organs is a huge deal, but he was skeptical about handing over the duties to another team. He discussed the difficulties with separate procurement and transplant teams. Multiple times, organs didn&#8217;t show up in the right way for transplant simply because transport team hadn&#8217;t evaluated the recipient anatomy. </p><p><em>Reimbursement</em>: Private insurers and Medicare reimburse differently for organ procurement. Private insurers pay on a per-patient basis, but Medicare pays for their fraction of organ procurement costs. The Medicare policy is a bit unintuitive. Say a transplant center spends 3 million to transport organs, and 40% of those organs are covered by Medicare. Medicare will pay the transplant center 40% of 3 million. Payments happen biweekly, but a year end audit is done to ensure everything is in order (great <a href="https://www.lungbioengineering.com/hcp/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/01/LungBio-Reimbursement-Guide_102820_final.pdf">guide</a> to reimbursement policy). Medicare is essentially piggybacking on any cost savings private insurance is responsible for. Another trend in reimbursement policy is a trend towards lump sum payments rather than fee-for-service. Instead of paying for each service performed, hospitals will receive one lump sum for each patient to cover all costs. Any profit margin is driven by better outcomes for lower costs. Hospitals want to lower costs as much as possible to maximize profits thus a non-inferior cold storage solution is favored when possible. The value proposition the OCS has for hospitals is increasing volumes rather than per transplant profit. </p><p><em><strong>Important Note: DRY RUNS. </strong></em>A dry run occurs when clinicians and the transplant team go to evaluate an organ but do not actually use it. In this case, they might place the organ on the OCS and determine it isn't viable for transplant. When I spoke someone who does lung transplants, he noted cold storage has a near 0% dry run rate at his hospital while the OCS rejects 30-40% of potential lungs. Dry runs aren't reimbursed thus costs are borne solely by the hospital. For cold storage, dry runs cost only person time. However, OCS dry runs cost $45k required additional resources to. Dry runs are a major disincentive to use the OCS in addition to the already high costs for a non-inferior solution.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73178990-39fc-4844-abea-0cfc8d9b810f_572x436.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73178990-39fc-4844-abea-0cfc8d9b810f_572x436.png" width="572" height="436" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/73178990-39fc-4844-abea-0cfc8d9b810f_572x436.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:436,&quot;width&quot;:572,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:315887,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73178990-39fc-4844-abea-0cfc8d9b810f_572x436.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73178990-39fc-4844-abea-0cfc8d9b810f_572x436.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73178990-39fc-4844-abea-0cfc8d9b810f_572x436.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73178990-39fc-4844-abea-0cfc8d9b810f_572x436.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Wasting 50k Sucks</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>UNOS allocation policy and Medicare OPO policy: </em>Two recent positive changes in policy should be highlighted. 1) UNOS changed their organ allocation policy to be based on recipient need rather than distance travelled. Almost immediately, this changes the picture for Transmedics since it's a solution designed for long distance transplants. 2) In a bipartisan attempt to increase organ donation, CMS changed <a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-finalizes-policy-will-increase-number-available-lifesavings-organs-holding-organ-procurement">policies</a> for Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs).

Hospitals love to run clinical trials for something like the OCS. It puts them in the news with positive publicity and TMDX partially subsidizes some of the cost. When they have to buy the system, it's a different decision based on outcomes and profit margins. Another potential difference is the concentration of transplant centers. Some transplant centers are much more willing to use the OCS and are proficient with new solutions (Here&#8217;s to you Dr Schroder) so expanding into new sites after a clinical trial can be difficult. Luckily there aren't many transplant centers in the USA and Transmedics is already integrated into most of them. </p><h3><strong>Competition: </strong></h3><p>Transmedics owns the transplant market in the US. There is some competition from Lung bioengineering with their XVIVO system for transporting lungs but the XVIVO system is primarily used in Europe.&nbsp; Both systems are different, and no head-to-head comparison exists although one advantage for the OCS could be a reduction of cold perfusion time (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1089253220905147">source</a>). The transplant center I spoke to had only used the OCS. For liver transplants, there is potential competition from OrganOx which is currently in late stage clinical trials with an IDE from the FDA and approval expected soon (<a href="https://www.organox.com/news/list">source</a>). XVIVO also has a CE-Marked Liver Assist device which will apply for FDA approval in 2021. Heart transplant devices are still in animal trials though one does have breakthrough device designation (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4426471-transmedics-stock-tread-carefully-with-medical-device-company">source</a>). Overall, competition is on the way since the market opportunity is large and recognized. Lots of perfusion systems are comparable but the OCS solution and device are both proprietary. In addition, the OCS is the only multi-organ transplant system which makes selling to large transplant centers and training surgeons easier. </p><p><strong>Summary and Takeaway: </strong>Selling the OCS isn't as simple as "increases donor utilization, it's a win". There are number of factors affecting commercialization summarized below. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F673bc999-8eae-481d-9fa5-bbadfeefaa52_624x321.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F673bc999-8eae-481d-9fa5-bbadfeefaa52_624x321.png" width="624" height="321" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/673bc999-8eae-481d-9fa5-bbadfeefaa52_624x321.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:321,&quot;width&quot;:624,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:111852,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F673bc999-8eae-481d-9fa5-bbadfeefaa52_624x321.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F673bc999-8eae-481d-9fa5-bbadfeefaa52_624x321.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F673bc999-8eae-481d-9fa5-bbadfeefaa52_624x321.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F673bc999-8eae-481d-9fa5-bbadfeefaa52_624x321.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><em>A note about timing:</em> a lot of the bear points&nbsp; aren't related to the product&nbsp; itself, but the <em><strong>timing </strong></em>of revenue acceleration. Revenue growth has to be there at 25x sales. Some investors don't care about the timing of revenue, but innovative companies in competitive industries have to accelerate growth fast. Each year without integration into hospitals is an opportunity for new competition increasing uncertainty and risk. Time is a risk for any medical device companies as innovation can happen at the speed of light. </p><h1>Financials</h1><p>Now we're at the point where we can try and model the financials for the three organs. </p><p>We know the following: </p><ul><li><p>Clinical data and approval outlook for all three organs</p></li><li><p>Reimbursement landscape for the OCS</p></li><li><p>The possible TAM for each organ (roughly)</p></li><li><p>The current TAM for each organ</p></li><li><p>Dynamics affecting rollout </p></li><li><p>How Lung rollout differs from Liver and Heart </p></li><li><p>The role of the National Service Program </p></li></ul><p>Most models tend to use historical revenue growth as a proxy for future growth, but with Transmedics, using such an approach is disingenuous to the company's position. It&#8217;s at an inflection point. Past revenue was driven by clinical trials while Transmedics is now entering the commercialization phase for all three organs (I believe both heart and liver will be approved). </p><p><em>Expected Margin Profile: </em>As with most medical device companies, at scale operating.&nbsp; margins will be in the ~30%. </p><p>For a company at 25x EV/sales, taking a longer term horizon is appropriate for most investors. Investors aren't looking to play short term trends driven by valuation expansion but rather for the disruptive potential the Organ Care System holds. </p><p>For a simple financial model out to 2025, we need to know 1) the estimated transplants in 2025, 2) the market share of TMDX, and 3) an expected multiple on the sales. </p><p>All previous factors must be accounted for when making our model. </p><p><strong>Lung: </strong>The uncertainty around the lung hurts our ability to forecast out to the future&gt; however, increased experience on the OCS combined with the NSP and new policies means revenue growth will be high. </p><p><strong>Heart</strong>: For the heart, I expect approval for the DBD expanded criteria indication and eventual DCD approval. We can assume a monopoly for extended criteria hearts for the OCS, but any currently transplanted organs will likely still use cold storage. </p><p><strong>Liver:</strong> Liver transplantation has tremendous potential given the nearly superior nature of the device. It may take time for transplant teams to get used to the OCS, but clinical outcomes could lead to increased usage for all livers rather than just for extended criteria ones. </p><p><strong>NSP: </strong>The valuation doesn&#8217;t account for any NSP revenue because it will likely be lower margin and is extraneous to the overall thesis. </p><p>Expected multiple: a reasonable 10x Sales multiple can be placed on the company. For the high expected margins and expected growth, comparable companies trade at such a valuation in perpetuity. With 25% EBIT margins, a 10x Sales multiple is a 40x EBIT multiple (average for fast growing medical device companies). If you are less sure about valuing it at such a steep multiple, feel free to edit the excel model in any way you feel necessary. </p><p>Playing around with the model and giving the following parameters, the IRR is 44% over 5 years. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e025053-5c40-4aa1-8119-a4c51c1afe8b_590x293.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e025053-5c40-4aa1-8119-a4c51c1afe8b_590x293.png" width="590" height="293" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0e025053-5c40-4aa1-8119-a4c51c1afe8b_590x293.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:293,&quot;width&quot;:590,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:79109,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e025053-5c40-4aa1-8119-a4c51c1afe8b_590x293.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e025053-5c40-4aa1-8119-a4c51c1afe8b_590x293.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e025053-5c40-4aa1-8119-a4c51c1afe8b_590x293.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e025053-5c40-4aa1-8119-a4c51c1afe8b_590x293.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>With expected multiple compression, it won't be a smooth ride, but near monopoly status in incremental organs (the head start is huge) and a growing market will lead to rapid growth in my opinion. 75% revenue growth for 5 years is no small feat so we have to take into account base rates. </p><p><em><strong>Base Rates: </strong></em>We must take into consideration the base rate chance they can achieve this outcome. 99.99% of all companies cannot compound revenue at these rates. The level of conviction needed to underwrite this return is high given the assumptions. One is assuming near monopoly status for incremental organs with sustained growth leading to 10x sales multiple. Say the base case is a 5-year revenue growth of 30% making the IRR ~8%. Imagine that, Transmedics has to grow 30%/year and maintain fairly high valuation (dependent on profitability and growth rates) just to hit a market return. TMDX is certainly poised to revolutionize the organ market but there is little margin for error when underwriting 70% revenue growth.  </p><p>However, this is where growth investors shine. While many investors (including me) become uncomfortable underwriting low probability events (i.e. growing 70% for 5 years), some have enough certainty to buy and hold even at seemingly high multiples. With enough research, you can find alpha in this uncertainty. </p><p><em>What about Cash and potential dilution?</em> Currently, TMDX has 112 million on the balance sheet with 34 million in Debt. With major clinical trial expenses out of the way and lots of free press through different publications, the rollout shouldn't cost as much as a drug rollout. Post-market surveillance studies will be expensive but Transmedics will receive all proceeds from the hospital instead of subsidizing parts of the OCS for the trial. Maturity, in terms of the margin profile won&#8217;t happen in 5 years, but they can certainly turn profitable by then if the FDA surveillance studies are complete. Regardless, if potential dilution or cash burn become an issue for Transmedics, I would be wary given the monopoly status of the solution and. Sustained unprofitability (3+ years at current levels) is a potential issue though I expect revenue to decrease operating losses. </p><h1>Growth and Risks</h1><p>I've modelled what I believe is reasonable but there are a number of growth opportunities and potential risks beyond those already discussed. </p><p><em>Growth opportunity 1: Potential Therapeutics with the OCS </em></p><p>Warm perfusion as a technique opens a box of opportunities to improve patient outcomes. One could deliver new drugs to the organ while in transport. Such therapeutics could improve recipient outcomes by improving donor organs. The primary concern with using extended criteria organs is recipient mortality. Using incremental organs obviously will lead to worse outcomes and improving those organs could be huge. Obvious roadblocks here include the timeline to develop potential therapeutics and the novelty of using such an approach </p><p><em>Opportunity 2: Kidney Transplants </em></p><p>Kidney transplantation is the best option for those with end stage renal failure. Ever heard of dialysis? It's the multi-billion-dollar industry which hinges on a lack of viable kidneys. Billions have ESRD while only 20k have kidney transplants. The opportunity here is obviously gigantic and everyone knows it. Waleed, in the most recent investor conference noted trials for the kidney were just starting so the timeline to approval is 5+ years out, but the platform nature of the OCS is encouraging. </p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7b2856b-9203-4b2e-bae6-4108d0fd299b_247x373.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7b2856b-9203-4b2e-bae6-4108d0fd299b_247x373.png" width="247" height="373" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f7b2856b-9203-4b2e-bae6-4108d0fd299b_247x373.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:373,&quot;width&quot;:247,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:137386,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7b2856b-9203-4b2e-bae6-4108d0fd299b_247x373.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7b2856b-9203-4b2e-bae6-4108d0fd299b_247x373.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7b2856b-9203-4b2e-bae6-4108d0fd299b_247x373.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7b2856b-9203-4b2e-bae6-4108d0fd299b_247x373.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><em>Opportunity 3: Reducing Costs of Transplants. </em></p><p>Currently, the high cost of OCS drastically reduces their TAM (in the current form). Given non-inferiority rather than superiority of the OCS, using it for patients which could have been transplanted with cold storage makes no sense. If the cost of the OCS dropped to 30k, volumes could dramatically increase. There is a point at which hospitals will make the switch to mostly OCS transplants instead of using the OCS primarily for extended criteria organs. </p><p>What kills the opportunity? </p><p><em>Risk 1: Incremental organs have worse outcomes</em></p><p>As mentioned before, one naturally expects worse outcomes from extended criteria organs. Since we currently don't use those organs, there is little survival data on those organs save for the OCS studies. Just as new drugs and engineering modifications could increase the quality of the organs, physiology could take over and keep outcomes for extended criteria organs non-inferior and even make it worse as one goes downstream of current donor characteristics. Although outcomes for organ transplantations are often the best option for end stage organ failure, the rubber will meet the road eventually in terms of cost vs benefit.</p><p><em>Risk 2: Slower than expected uptake</em></p><p>Piggybacking off the previous point, there are a number of reasons which could slow use of the OCS. Experience with the Lung OCS will guide Heart/Liver rollout and growth will accelerate faster, but there still exists this risk. </p><p><em>Risk 3: Faster than expected competition</em></p><p>Obviously, any competition is bad and faster than expected competition would hinder growth. The OCS is a monopoly paving the way in the minds of the FDA and surgeons to use extended criteria organs. Any competitors will have an edge in gaining mindshare simply because physicians and regulators have been through a similar process with the OCS. On the other hand, if competition is slow, the OCS is already integrated into many transplant centers and startups with equivalent devices will have a tough time selling into those centers. The multi-organ, platform nature of the OCS is a key advantage here. Competition risk is lower than one might expect. </p><p><em>Risk 4: Capacity Constraints. </em></p><p>One risk is the capacity of transplant centers to transplant more organs. I couldn't quantify a potential shortage of transplant surgeons, but this risk does exist as a potential cap on growth. This risk falls into the uncertainty category rather than risk category.</p><p>Note: I couldn&#8217;t get ahold of IR to discuss any of these potential risks so I may mischaracterize certain nuances of the industry and company. </p><h1>What to Track Going Forward</h1><p>There are a few key metrics and trends to track for TMDX. </p><ol><li><p>Transplant Growth: most important for Transmedics is the continued ability to grow and an important metric is the increase in overall number of transplants being performed. Incremental transplants would be enabled by Transmedics. </p></li><li><p>Market share/Competition: keep a close eye on any competition which could affect market share and slow growth. Adjacent to this point is growth in the National Service Program. Growth in the NSP could be used as a proxy for how integrated Transmedics is into transplant centers and represent a switching cost. </p></li><li><p>Clinical Data: any improvements in the OCS which demonstrate it is superior to cold storage would dramatically increase the TAM to all transplanted organs. On the other hand, if the OCS demonstrates worse outcomes in the real world for incremental organs, growth will stall (I find this scenario unlikely). </p></li><li><p>Margins: The margin profile should dramatically improve with scale and lower trial costs reaching that of a mature medical device company in the 20-30% EBIT margin range. If they can&#8217;t reduce operating loss with revenue growth, there are serious issues. &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Legislation: New legislation for insurance companies, OPOs, organ allocation systems, or transplant centers could all trigger or slow growth. Keep a close eye on any moves to increase transplantation. </p></li><li><p>Kidney OCS: keep a close eye on these trials even if it&#8217;s 3+ years away for approval. Kidney transplants are a huge market and any news could move the stock in weird ways. </p></li></ol><h1>Lessons Learned</h1><p>This is quickly becoming my favorite part to write. Putting lessons from research on paper solidifies and improves my thinking for any new companies I evaluate. </p><p>1.&nbsp;Talk to people who experience a product: The most informative conversation I had was with someone who had transplanted lungs with the OCS. All questions about outcomes, dry runs, reimbursement, and boots on the ground experience were answered. Use whatever possible channels you have to get into contact with people in the industry. I attended a reimbursement webinar from a competitor which taught me more than any document from the company </p><p>2.&nbsp;Trust but verify: the TAM question is one where Transmedics' investor presentation doesn't lie, but also doesn&#8217;t paint the whole picture. We aren't transplanting $8B worth of organs&#8230;.yet. To the best of your abilities, verify all information published by the company.</p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F58d1e663-34ce-4a2c-8487-47ba5ed54517_512x487.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F58d1e663-34ce-4a2c-8487-47ba5ed54517_512x487.png" width="512" height="487" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/58d1e663-34ce-4a2c-8487-47ba5ed54517_512x487.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:487,&quot;width&quot;:512,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:603951,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F58d1e663-34ce-4a2c-8487-47ba5ed54517_512x487.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F58d1e663-34ce-4a2c-8487-47ba5ed54517_512x487.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F58d1e663-34ce-4a2c-8487-47ba5ed54517_512x487.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F58d1e663-34ce-4a2c-8487-47ba5ed54517_512x487.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p></p><p>3.&nbsp;Invest in what you know: Understanding the detailed mechanics of any industry is key to investing in any company for the long term.

Unlike other long term positions, my position in DAIO is intended to be a play on short term upside and the write-up is intended to provide a framework on the stock rather than a detailed breakdown. </p><p>I may be the only person on Substack starting a post off touting my non-credentials, but I felt it necessary to frame the thesis. With that said, let&#8217;s get into it.  </p><p>I alerted readers to the opportunity in DAIO in my <a href="https://adus.substack.com/p/q2-portfolio-update-and-thoughts">Q2 portfolio update</a>. </p><blockquote><p><em><strong>"DAIO is undergoing a business transformation yet it's cheap solely as a cyclical equipment manufacturer and the potential shift in business is just icing on the cake.</strong></em>" </p></blockquote><p>Lots of the information in this write-up is presented well in the investor presentation, but I wanted to talk about my mentality buying the stock. </p><h1><strong>Business</strong></h1><p>Data I/O sells programming systems for microcontrollers. Yea, I also didn't understand what the hell that meant the first time I read it. </p><p>Programming serves as the middleman between semiconductor manufacturers and the final product. Every chip needs to be programmed to give it life and each chip is programmed in a different way depending on the final application. Programming is analogous to teaching a child language; it's readies them for use and is essential for the functioning of the chip. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c9f4931-3a43-4e99-8ae1-7a145438fa9e_567x440.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c9f4931-3a43-4e99-8ae1-7a145438fa9e_567x440.png" width="567" height="440" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7c9f4931-3a43-4e99-8ae1-7a145438fa9e_567x440.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:440,&quot;width&quot;:567,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;GIVES llFETO CHIPS &quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="GIVES llFETO CHIPS " title="GIVES llFETO CHIPS " srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c9f4931-3a43-4e99-8ae1-7a145438fa9e_567x440.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c9f4931-3a43-4e99-8ae1-7a145438fa9e_567x440.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c9f4931-3a43-4e99-8ae1-7a145438fa9e_567x440.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c9f4931-3a43-4e99-8ae1-7a145438fa9e_567x440.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Data IO sells the capital equipment needed to program these chips.

Think of UFS as a more different language than typical eMMC programming which is useful for certain industries and a limited number of programming companies can support the format. Even if this isn&#8217;t a huge revenue driver, it anecdotally demonstrates company&#8217;s innovative nature. </p><p>Still, even as the company has faster speeds and better capabilities, the business of selling programming equipment is highly cyclical. Data IO is especially reliant on automotive demand. Data IO notes programming demand is equal to Chips * Bits. Even as the # bits/car grows, the automotive industry was in a downcycle from 2018 to 2020. This dragged revenues down from 34M to 20M from peak to trough. </p><h2><strong>Security and the SentriX pitch</strong></h2><p>Data IO has attempted to transition beyond cyclical equipment manufacturer through programming security on chips (i.e. embedded security). I'm still unclear on the exact advantages, but programming security onto a chip is useful for certain applications, more flexible than other security approaches,&nbsp; and allows chips to be secure earlier in the product cycle exposing them to less risk. For more info on the advantages, I suggest this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2pSmGp1XJk">video</a>. </p><div id="youtube2-_2pSmGp1XJk" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;_2pSmGp1XJk&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_2pSmGp1XJk?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>SentriX is intended to be a pay-per use model instead of the typical capital equipment sale. They did license it out for a customer in Q2 for an annual fee rather than usage based, but essentially they sell the system upgrades for free and derive revenue on  chips programmed. They have a 370 system installed base which can program 1B chips/year with about 50% eligible for SentriX (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4443739-data-i-o-corporation-daio-ceo-anthony-ambrose-on-q2-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript">source: Q2 earnings call</a>). Assuming a price of 20 cents/chip, the SentriX market has a current TAM of $100M in high margin revenue. From their investor presentation, they identify 3-4B chips which can be programmed with security putting the whole embedded security TAM at $600-800M. </p><p>When SentriX was introduced, some investors jumped on the thesis. Shareholders Unite has a number of <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DAIO/analysis">articles on Seeking Alpha</a> and Avi Fisher over at Long Cast Advisors <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/581274a0f5e231316b7c8224/t/5c0a97150e2e7247df3578f9/1544197909611/DAIO+SumZero+report+FINAL.pdf">pitched it in 2018. </a>They pitched it as follows: an innovative company mitigating cyclicality with a new recurring revenue business model (sound familiar?) Data IO would have a higher margin recurring revenue stream driven by an increase in security demand even though the stock was priced as purely cyclical. The thesis hasn't played out yet because of difficulties with the SentriX system and a general lack of demand for security programming at the chip level.  </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09e52ea9-9a0e-48fe-86c4-33b64a079cb7_500x750.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09e52ea9-9a0e-48fe-86c4-33b64a079cb7_500x750.png" width="328" height="492" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/09e52ea9-9a0e-48fe-86c4-33b64a079cb7_500x750.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:750,&quot;width&quot;:500,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:328,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09e52ea9-9a0e-48fe-86c4-33b64a079cb7_500x750.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09e52ea9-9a0e-48fe-86c4-33b64a079cb7_500x750.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09e52ea9-9a0e-48fe-86c4-33b64a079cb7_500x750.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09e52ea9-9a0e-48fe-86c4-33b64a079cb7_500x750.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h2><strong>Why Now?</strong></h2><p>At risk of sounding like a gold bug saying inflation&#8217;s around the corner, I believe the company is positioned better than ever before to capture this security market. The SentriX system was upgraded to ease implementation (one day turnaround for a system upgrade) and Data IO now wholly owns the IP behind SentriX. The previous model had Data IO licensing IP from SecureThingz. Anthony Ambrose, who owns 5% of the stock, believes security is the future of programming even if it takes time. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76b497d8-bac7-4bb5-817b-e48df33a7e13_1177x190.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76b497d8-bac7-4bb5-817b-e48df33a7e13_1177x190.png" width="1177" height="190" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/76b497d8-bac7-4bb5-817b-e48df33a7e13_1177x190.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:190,&quot;width&quot;:1177,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;think &#230;ry by the in in Q: , it what aming out \nof last #ar.

In the most recent quarter, management pointed to increased interest in SentriX and a key win of an automotive customer (though they are licensing the tech rather than using a usage based model). </p><p><em>The Upcycle is here</em></p><p>Putting aside security, all signs point to an upswing in automotive demand. Industry estimates, management commentary, and recent financial results from both DAIO and bigger chip manufacturers like NXPI and Infineon point towards increased automotive demand. Although chip shortages may slow down the upcycle, demand is there. As older machines from the previous cycle need to be replaced,  Data IO&#8217;s financial results will follow through. </p><h2><strong>Management </strong></h2><p>I'm an outsider to the semiconductor industry and management knows the business much better than I do which means I need to trust them. CEO Anthony Ambrose joined in 2012 and restructured the business to focus on the automotive market with effective capital allocation. Data IO improved their financial position through innovation and returned cash to shareholders through 8M in buybacks. I trust his judgement regarding long term industry trends and the ability to effectively allocate capital. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff60236a4-fa49-4c6f-8746-3fa7454b8d99_717x348.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff60236a4-fa49-4c6f-8746-3fa7454b8d99_717x348.png" width="491" height="238.30962343096235" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f60236a4-fa49-4c6f-8746-3fa7454b8d99_717x348.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:348,&quot;width&quot;:717,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:491,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Downturn-in-Semis \nTHIS IS FINe. \nDAIO with!13 In cash &quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Downturn-in-Semis

The macro reliance and my general lack of insider knowledge would make most assumptions moot, but modelling isn&#8217;t necessary in my opinion. The story here is one as old as time<strong>.</strong> Investing in cyclical businesses isn't my forte, but let&#8217;s speculate nonetheless (seems to work for lots of &#8220;Fintwit gurus&#8221;). </p><p>DAIO had 20M in revenue for 2020 with -$3.9M in net losses. At the peak in 2017, they had $34M in revenue with $5.5M in net income. If we simply assume the cycle repeats itself, at $6.43 a share, their market cap is 55M putting them at 10X peak earnings. This is appropriate&nbsp;for a cyclical equipment manufacturer so where's the upside? It comes in three forms. 1) increases in peak net income. 2) changed business model 3) investor psychology. </p><ol><li><p><em>Peak cycle improvements: </em>DAIO has improved their industry positioning since 2017  positioning them to capture more demand this time around. The incremental margin on sales is 50% (source: management guide and latest Q results) so any increases in sales are extremely profitable. A combination of increased peak cycle automotive chip demand due to the electronification of cars and improvement in market positioning could increase peak cycle net income. </p></li><li><p>Change business model: As discussed before, the SentriX business change is well underway having matured since 2017.

I could see seeking alpha articles touting Data IO as a play on IoT/Security demand at the peak of the cycle. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2cd2430-946a-48fa-93b9-c86caea69384_675x499.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2cd2430-946a-48fa-93b9-c86caea69384_675x499.png" width="491" height="362.9762962962963" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a2cd2430-946a-48fa-93b9-c86caea69384_675x499.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:499,&quot;width&quot;:675,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:491,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2cd2430-946a-48fa-93b9-c86caea69384_675x499.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2cd2430-946a-48fa-93b9-c86caea69384_675x499.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2cd2430-946a-48fa-93b9-c86caea69384_675x499.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2cd2430-946a-48fa-93b9-c86caea69384_675x499.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The stars have aligned three fold: growing market, best-in-class business, downcycle prices. I expect shares to be worth $10+ in the next upcycle which could happen in less than a year. After reporting good Q2 results (setting aside comps against a COVID weakened quarter), the stock should be worth more than it is today. </p><h2><strong>Risks and Downside</strong></h2><p>Risk 1, Timing: The trading thesis hinges on catching the timing of an automotive upcycle. If the upswing in demand is delayed, upside in the stock will be constrained. Cars are still supply constrained given the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/semiconductor-shortage-us-auto-industry-2021-06-22/">chip shortage</a> so true demand is hard to parse out. However, management and <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/210511-global-auto-sales-forecasts-the-recovery-gears-up-11952032#:~:text=Related%20Research-,Key%20Takeaways,from%2077%20million%20in%202020.&amp;text=Electric%20vehicles%20(including%20plug%2Din,2020%20and%202.5%25%20in%202019.">industry estimates</a> believe we are in the beginning of an automotive demand upswing which will accelerate into 2022. </p><p>Risk 2, Unknown unknowns: Semis are hard and I am no expert. A few Youtube videos, podcasts, transcripts, and conversations are not nearly enough to understand the future of chip programming. Semiconductors are a nuanced industry with layers of people, nations, and innovation. The CEO strongly believes programming security onto a chip will be important and <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iar-systems-acquires-secure-thingz-300617344.html#:~:text=Previously%2C%20IAR%20Systems%20has%20acquired,amount%20to%20approximately%20230%20MSEK.">transactions in the space</a> certainly indicate such a shift, but new innovation or other industry factors may continue to limit SentriX growth. Unknowns unknowns are the worst form of risk and investing in DAIO contain this risk. The position remains speculative. </p><p><em><strong>Limited downside: </strong></em>Especially attractive about DAIO is the limited downside profile. Management has prudently set up a cash pile with &gt;25% of the market cap in cash. They have bought back shares in the past suggesting willingness to put cash to work for shareholders if the stock is materially undervalued. <strong> </strong></p><p>If you enjoyed this thesis, follow my twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/AduSubramanian">@AduSubramanian</a> too!

FF to the last three sections if you don&#8217;t care about the reasons or sources behind my conclusions. </p><p>TLDR: Intuitive is too rich for my eyes likely returning 6% over the next ten years. Competition and increased scrutiny on prices represent risks to growth and margins. Even holding margins consistent, the assumptions needed for the stock to return 12-15% IRR are unreasonable. Intuitive&#8217;s history does provide some lessons for investors even if one doesn&#8217;t buy the stock.  A short term acceleration in revenue could might happen, but valuation prevents me from investing. If one is ok with holding for an 8% return over 10 years and/or is betting on short term revenue acceleration, then ISRG could be a good stock to own.</p><h1>Company History: Aimed for the Heart, Hit the Prostate</h1><p>Intuitive Surgical's origins trace back to SRI International, a research institute at Stanford. In the early 1990's, SRI developed a surgical robot which caught the eye of DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a US agency focused on innovation). DARPA, known for funding the internet, joined the project as a partner wanting to use the technology to perform remote surgery on soldiers. In mid-1995 Dr. Frederic Moll, alongside John Freund and Robert Younge, founded Intuitive surgical with intentions to commercialize SRI's research. The current CEO, Gary Guthart joined the company in 1996 as a control systems analyst. </p><p>Intuitive's first "Da Vinci" robotic system released in 1998 starting first in Europe with heart surgeries while seeking approval from the FDA. Intuitive went public in 2000 with FDA clearance for gallbladder surgery and gastroesophageal disease surgery approval following quickly thereafter. Initially, the prohibitively high cost of accessories and lack of clinical evidence led the robot to be used like a treadmill in a basement: as a coat rack. Intuitive's saving grace came in the early 2000s with prostate surgery (hence the title "Aimed for the Heart, hit the prostate"). Urologists used robotic surgery to perform difficult prostatectomies because other minimally invasive approaches were not viable and open surgery led to high complication rates. </p><p>Even though Intuitive started seeing clinical success, co-founders Moll and Younge left in 2002, likely disappointed the robot wasn't being used for heart surgeries. Moll continued to work on surgical robotics and created Hansen Medical (now Auris Health) focused on catheter navigation and Mako Robotics for orthopedic applications. </p><p>It may be hard to believe, but Intuitive's steepest competition came in its earliest days. Computer Motion, another surgical robotics company sued Intuitive for patent infringement in 1998. Litigation dragged on for years, burning cash, and hurting sales for both companies. Tired of litigation, the two companies merged in 2003 under Intuitive. The FDA approved the Da Vinci system for more indications such as robotic hysterectomy and sales picked up. Since then, Intuitive has been one of the best performing business with a correspondingly great stock performance.

System sales are sales of the Da Vinci robot with an average selling price (ASP) of $1.5-2 million. System contracts are yearly contracts paid by the hospital for servicing, ~12% of the original system sales itself.&nbsp; Disposable revenue comes from instruments used during surgeries (each instrument has a limited life. Intuitive is the sole source for most instruments used with the Da Vinci system, thus margins for this segment are extremely high. On recent financial statements, a line item for 'operating leases' shows up, but that represents system sales paid for over time or on a usage-based model rather than upfront. You can see their revenue breakdown by year between systems, disposables, and service contracts. </p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43d38792-f25c-4509-bd47-6d5ae61227f0_624x376.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43d38792-f25c-4509-bd47-6d5ae61227f0_624x376.png" width="624" height="376" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/43d38792-f25c-4509-bd47-6d5ae61227f0_624x376.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:376,&quot;width&quot;:624,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:36573,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43d38792-f25c-4509-bd47-6d5ae61227f0_624x376.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43d38792-f25c-4509-bd47-6d5ae61227f0_624x376.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43d38792-f25c-4509-bd47-6d5ae61227f0_624x376.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43d38792-f25c-4509-bd47-6d5ae61227f0_624x376.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p></p><p>About 70% of their revenue is recurring (disposables and services), up from 57% in 2012. Intuitive surgical combines the best of capital-intensive businesses with the best of SaaS businesses. It sells an expensive product with a long lifecycle (5-7 years) and high switching costs all while receiving high-margin recurring revenue from the sale of accessories and contracts. Sure, Gillette sells razors and razor blades but imagine a razor-razor blade model where razors cost $1000000+ and require regulatory approval to start selling. It&#8217;s harder to switch surgical systems than razors.</p><p><em><strong>The Moats</strong></em></p><p>A moat is distinct from competitive advantages. Competitive advantages are objectively measured (i.e. better results) while moats often cannot be measured (status quo, brand loyalty, regulation). </p><p><em>Moat 1 with Hospitals:</em> Hospitals commit so much capital up front for a Da Vinci system that constantly switching the systems isn't realistic. Intuitive originally had trouble selling for this exact reason: hospitals wouldn't commit $1+ million to buy a low usage system that could be litigated out of existence. However, once they're in a hospital, the upfront investment in terms of capital and surgeon training keeps the Da Vinci there. Hospitals are willing to <a href="https://twitter.com/AnthPB/status/1417879125109493763/photo/1">trial new systems</a>, but the Da Vinci system is squarely in first place with minimal replacement risk. </p><p><em>Moat 2 with Doctors:</em> Doctors hate change. They hate it. Imagine this: a hospital buys a Da Vinci System, requires their doctors to train on it for 1 year (average time to become proficient, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5486586/#:~:text=The%20initial%20years%20of%20the,they%20lacked%20uniformity%20in%20credentialing.">source</a> + anecdotal conversations) and then performs procedures for 5 years. Putting aside the extra millions spent to buy a new system, Doctors do NOT want to switch robotic systems unless there are clear and demonstrated benefits. This leads to a chicken/egg issue where new entrants need adoption to create clinical data and need clinical data to drive adoption. Some say switching between robotic systems is easier than the switch from laparoscopic to robotic surgery, but I believe there will have to be a step change difference between systems for people to switch. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64cc197b-80ca-438b-a54e-385bebab626c_299x295.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64cc197b-80ca-438b-a54e-385bebab626c_299x295.png" width="299" height="295" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/64cc197b-80ca-438b-a54e-385bebab626c_299x295.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:295,&quot;width&quot;:299,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:192577,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64cc197b-80ca-438b-a54e-385bebab626c_299x295.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64cc197b-80ca-438b-a54e-385bebab626c_299x295.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64cc197b-80ca-438b-a54e-385bebab626c_299x295.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64cc197b-80ca-438b-a54e-385bebab626c_299x295.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><em>Moat 2a with Students: </em>Intuitive's tentacles extend to those in residency (the last step between medical school and becoming a full-time doctor).

Students want to intern there, and professionals love to work there. It is an innovative company located in the Bay Area with a funnel of talent from top universities. I can't speak to internal culture, but bioengineers looking for a fast-paced, innovative environment would love to work there. </p><h1>Industry and Competition</h1><p>Buckle up for this section where I'll cover Robotic surgery, the TAM, and the competition. </p><p><strong>Industry overview: </strong></p><p><strong>Types of surgery </strong></p><p>There are three types of surgery: Open, Laparoscopic, and Robotic.

Laparoscopic surgery is a minimally invasive technique using fiber optic cameras and small incisions which minimizes recovery time and improves many patient outcomes (scarring, pain, infection risk). However, Laparoscopic methods aren't appropriate for every type of surgery and aren't perfect. Surgeons lose the &#8216;feel&#8217; of open surgery, have to use unnatural tools and it places musculoskeletal stress on a surgeon due to awkward. Robotic Surgery completely abstracts direct surgeon patient interaction, using a robot to make incisions and operate on the patient. The robot is more stable with more elegant tools/movements and is more comfortable for a surgeon. However, it also abstracts all 'feel' and even with advanced visualization, many surgeons were resistant to use robotic surgery (especially older surgeons). </p><p><em><strong>Outcome measures:</strong></em></p><p>It's hard to generalize outcome measures for each modality across all surgeries, but if one could do it as follows. <strong>Minimally invasive techniques are better than open surgery, but the difference between laparoscopy and robotic is minimal when considering traditional surgical complication metrics for many surgeries. However, robotic surgery could have potential benefits with non-traditional metrics such as long-term readmission, consistency of outcomes, and patient comfort. </strong></p><p>I'm too curious to let it stand so we&#8217;ll analyze the 6 main surgical markets independently. </p><p><em>Urology:</em> Both Partial Nephrectomy and Prostatectomy are common Urological procedures on the Da Vinci system. Prostatectomy was the first major surgery performed consistently on the robot and as mentioned before was Intuitive&#8217;s saving grace. It skipped the middle step of laparascopy and went directly from open to robotic surgery. For most Urological procedures, outcome measures are great with <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/2019/03/25/robotic-surgery-future-of-urology/#.YO-HcehKhEE">less blood loss and better recovery times</a> compared to all other approaches. The present and future of urology is <a href="https://www.icurology.org/pdf/10.4111/icu.2016.57.2.75">robotic</a> as open surgery is anatomically difficult for this field and laparascopy was never done. </p><p><em>Gynecology</em>: The second field to grab hold of robotic surgery was gynecology. When I spoke to an OB/GYN about her surgical experience, 85%+ of her hysterectomies (removal of uterus either for cancer or personal reasons) were done robotically. Robotics certainly beats open surgery, but for simpler procedures, laparoscopy is certainly <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4290120/">an option.</a> One piece of anecdotal evidence regarding patient outcomes is noticeably more pain on sites incised laparoscopically compared to sites incised robotically (perhaps due to the inherent stability of a robot). For both surgeon and patient satisfaction reasons, Robotic surgery is well-penetrated in the gynecological field. It has relatively good outcomes, <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ogi/2011/852061/">even comparing to laparascopy, although costs are higher. </a></p><p><em>General surgery: Bariatrics, Cholecystectomy, Hernia, and Colorectal</em></p><p><em>Bariatric:</em> Bariatric surgery is surgery done for weight loss. According to a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11695-016-2408-5">2016 systematic review</a> of Robotic vs Laparoscopic bariatric surgery, " There were no significant differences between Robotic bariatric surgery (RBS) and Laparoscopic bariatric surgery (LBS) with respect to post-operative complications, major complications, the length of hospital stay, reoperation, conversion, and mortality. Nevertheless, RBS was burdened by longer operative times and higher hospital costs when compared with LBS." However, "incidence of anastomotic leak [a key complication of abdominal surgery] was lower with robotic surgery" (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11695-016-2408-5">source</a>). Another 2020 <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32917364/">study</a> found robotic bariatric surgery cost ineffective. However, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32917364/">others</a> have found lower mortality with robotics and potential for better outcomes if long term outcomes were evaluated. As a high revenue surgery, Bariatric is a key market. Outcomes are mixed here so physician discretion can decide method of surgery. </p><p><em>Cholecystectomy:</em> Cholecystectomy is the removal of a gallbladder. Outcomes here are murky with low rates of complications with both laparascopy and robotic surgery so we need more long-term evidence (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33892794/">source</a>). Some have suggested using robotics for more complex cases and others have found some benefits with this approach. One promising new technique is single site robotic cholecystectomy which compares favorably to single site laparascopy for cosmetic and pain reasons (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7881280/">source</a>).</p><p><em>Hernia Repair:</em> there are two types of hernia repair: ventral (through the chest) and inguinal (through the groin). Robotic surgery is the best option for ventral hernias, but the evidence is a little unclear for inguinal hernial repair and often up to surgeon discretion (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6193421/">source</a>). However, inguinal hernia repairs can make up most robotic surgeries for general surgeons (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32141046/">source</a>) suggesting there are benefits to the approach. In Europe, cost is a prohibitive factor for hernial repairs because reimbursement is low compared to the USA. I've heard anecdotes of hospital execs preventing surgeons from doing hernia repairs robotically because the margins were negative. Hernia is a near term growth driver but could bring down revenue per procedure. </p><p><em>Colorectal:</em> This is another market with ambiguous outcomes but higher costs (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00464-019-06672-7">source</a>). However colorectal surgeons perform lots of robotic surgeries and perceptions in the field are that robotic surgery provides some benefit clinically and lots of benefit in terms of comfort. </p><p><em>Summary: </em>Using traditional metrics, robotic surgery often does not offer lower complication rates than laparascopy even though it is better than open surgery. However, long term outcomes and doctor/patient comfort must also be weighed against the high costs to performing robotic surgery.</p><p>Bonus:<em> Bronchoscopy:</em> Here, Da-Vinci recently introduced the Ion platform for doing lung biopsies. It is not a monopoly, but robotic techniques are clearly better than traditional ones. (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7330790/">source</a>)</p><p><strong>One important Note: Robotic Surgery is going to improve, laparascopy will not. As advanced robotic systems enter the market, robotic outcomes will get better while laparascopy will stagnate. The timeline of improvement and costs of future improvements is unknown, but in 50 years, I expect most surgery to be done robotically at a low cost. </strong></p><p><strong>I can&#8217;t recommend this piece by the New Yorker enough. Although it does get ahead of itself, the article does a great job telling the story of robotic surgery: https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/09/30/paging-dr-robot</strong></p><p><em><strong>Total Addressable Market</strong></em>:</p><p>&nbsp;Now that we understand general outcome measures and adoption, the next step is to establish a TAM. We need to segregate soft tissue surgery, Intuitive's playing field, from joint surgery, which has more established systems like MAKO and Globus Medical. The investor presentation identifies 6 million near term potential surgeries and 20 million total soft tissue surgical procedures. </p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd817f47f-ef2c-4905-9648-0dc5d68c44fc_624x352.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd817f47f-ef2c-4905-9648-0dc5d68c44fc_624x352.png" width="624" height="352" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d817f47f-ef2c-4905-9648-0dc5d68c44fc_624x352.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:352,&quot;width&quot;:624,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:71067,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd817f47f-ef2c-4905-9648-0dc5d68c44fc_624x352.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd817f47f-ef2c-4905-9648-0dc5d68c44fc_624x352.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd817f47f-ef2c-4905-9648-0dc5d68c44fc_624x352.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd817f47f-ef2c-4905-9648-0dc5d68c44fc_624x352.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p></p><p>Assuming they maintain the current per procedure revenue rate ($2000), the immediate TAM is $12 billion.

It's better to look at the number of Operating Rooms (ORs). There are ~<a href="https://askwonder.com/research/operating-rooms-present-us-436t01ddx">200k</a> non-Ambulatory Surgery Center operating rooms in the US. ~30% of these ORs are "integrated operating rooms" meaning 66k have the capabilities for a robot. Long term, most ORs will become integrated which is just connected certain electronics. Of the fifteen most common procedures in ORs, <a href="https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb186-Operating-Room-Procedures-United-States-2012.jsp">~25% are soft tissue</a> surgeries. If we assume this surgery split is consistent across all procedures and ORs, there are currently ~16,000 potential US placements for surgical robots in soft tissue surgery. This is back of the hand math but gives an approximation of Intuitive's market share in terms of installed base (3700/16000 = ~25%). </p><p>The rest of the world is difficult to predict, but if the global market split for ORs tracks the split for procedures (50/50 split), there are another 16,000 international operating rooms for Intuitive.

If it's the same outcome as laparascopy and possibly less pain, why not request it from your doctor since insurance pays for it? Patient demand is a key driver of growth for Intuitive and the price insensitivity is part of that puzzle. </p><p><em>For doctors:</em> There are a few benefits. Robotic surgery leads to more consistent outcomes and greater doctor comfort. A doctor performing an open/laparoscopic surgery will have different results at 7:30 am and 3:30 pm as surgery takes a toll. Increased comfort and ease of navigation lead to consistent results using a surgical robot. Another benefit of robotic surgery stems from the procedure data. Each surgery is tracked with detail so doctors can review previous surgeries, examine mistakes, and improve. The advanced visualization on a robot is also difficult to take away once accustomed to it, <em>even after losing the feel of laparoscopic surgery</em>. </p><p><em>For hospitals:</em> Between all three actors, hospitals are the ones who bear the cost burden of robotic surgery. Costs are higher but reimbursement is the same so hospitals find a way to make up the difference. They can do this in two ways: volume of surgeries and improvements in long term outcomes such as readmission rates. First and foremost, buying a surgical robot will drive more patients (and doctors) to the hospital. Second, Hospital stays are so costly that even slight reductions in hospital time can lead to immense savings. In addition, the $2000 in disposables per cases pales in comparison to the total cost of some cases so even slight improvements in outcomes can make a purchase worth it. </p><p>Intuitive's direct to doctor selling model helps sell robots by convincing hospitals the Da Vinci will be used so costs will be recouped. A surgeon might request a robot and say "I want to perform 100% robotic surgeries in 2 years" so the hospital is more likely to buy that robot. If all doctors want to perform robotic surgery, the Da Vinci system transitions from being a luxury into being a tax, a fantastic transition for a business to make. Hospitals will <em>have </em>to buy a robot rather than <em>wanting </em>to buy a robot. </p><p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8185660/">This article</a> by @daviesbj walks us through why urology adopted robotic surgery.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ed7028a-0353-4d2a-a75f-955af9c25d03_1779x1027.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ed7028a-0353-4d2a-a75f-955af9c25d03_1779x1027.png" width="577" height="333.2809065934066" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7ed7028a-0353-4d2a-a75f-955af9c25d03_1779x1027.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:841,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:577,&quot;bytes&quot;:105822,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ed7028a-0353-4d2a-a75f-955af9c25d03_1779x1027.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ed7028a-0353-4d2a-a75f-955af9c25d03_1779x1027.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ed7028a-0353-4d2a-a75f-955af9c25d03_1779x1027.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ed7028a-0353-4d2a-a75f-955af9c25d03_1779x1027.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><em>Keeping up with the Joneses: </em>On a hunch, I think there is a version of the prisoner's dilemma occurring between hospitals that have competition.

They go to a doctor observe their surgeries suggest potential improvements using a robotic system. Doctors usually adopt it quickly and will then go (with Intuitive) to the hospital exec team to buy a robot. It can be hard convincing execs unless a substantial number of procedures will be done on the robot, so doctors must convince hospitals that usage will be high. While the accessory revenues must be approved by a different team, buying a surgical robot is a huge purchase that is made at the top. </p><p>Competition:</p><p>Intuitive is a monopoly, but competition is on the horizon from larger companies like Medtronic and J&amp;J and startups like CMR surgical and Transenterix. Segregating soft tissue surgery from other surgery is important as companies like Mako, Zimmer Biomet, and Globus Medical aren't direct competitors to the Da Vinci system. </p><p><em>Transenterix (Ascensus Surgical (ASXC)): </em>Let's start with the hype stock: Transenterix. They are FDA approved for several surgeries yet have performed less than 10000 procedures to date. Most doctors I spoke to had never heard of the company and the system was described as too bulky for use in an OR. They supposedly fix some pitfalls of the Da Vinci system such as including haptic feedback and reusable instruments, but these slight advantages aren't enough. I give this company a &lt; 5% chance of disrupting Intuitive on any time frame. It </p><p><em>CMR surgical: </em>CMR surgical has launched a robot directed at simpler surgeries. It sells primarily in Europe and is gathering data for FDA approval. The company is involved in most public hospital bids (for govt run healthcare systems) and has a usage-based pricing model. I believe they are the foremost competition for Intuitive. They are not likely to disrupt Intuitive in the current market but are targeting simpler surgeries. CMR's system has more mobility and can be used in outpatient centers. Threat of disruption is low, but CMR is Intuitive's biggest competition for future growth. </p><p><em>Medtronic: </em>Medtronic's surgical system is still in development after setting an initial launch in 2018. It is planning to enter human trials soon. There are many unknowns about the robot, but scuttlebutt says it will have 4 separate carts for four arms instead of one big system like Intuitive. After eventual approval, Medtronic will certainly have an advantage selling systems compared to a startup. With the volume of accessories/instruments sold by Medtronic to hospitals, they can bundle these and sell at a discount to hospital. In addition, surgeons may find using Medtronic instruments on a robot natural because of a history of using Medtronic instruments in other surgeries. Chance to disrupt Intuitive within 5 years- 1/10, 10 years - 3.5/10</p><p><em>J&amp;J/Google: </em>A J&amp;J/Google joint venture with Verb surgical fell flat on its face as Google pulled out of the partnership, but J&amp;J continues to develop the project in collaboration with Fred Moll from Auris Health (remember him, he was a founder of Intuitive Surgical). This system is so far off that it is hard to judge if the Verb venture will turn into anything. It plans to start trials in <a href="https://www.medtechdive.com/news/jj-drops-planned-510k-for-verb-auris-robot-targets-2022-clinical-trial/581809/">2022</a> and management has provided little guidance on development. If the product is developed, J&amp;J will have the same advantages as Medtronic selling to hospitals.

Although Titan has partnered with Medtronic, Intuitive sells a single port system (Da Vinci SP) which is already achieving clinical success.</p><p><em>Auris Health: </em>Auris Health competes with Intuitive's Ion system meant for bronchoscopies, not the Da Vinci system. It has an edge in terms of time in the market (approved in 2018 vs Ion approved in 2019) but Intuitive's scale lends an advantage when selling systems. Regarding technical specifications, Auris' platform has better visualization but a larger bronchoscope which hinders the ability to reach smaller parts of the lung. I cannot tell which platform is "better", but they are similar enough that relationships will drive system sales, not technical evidence for now. &nbsp;There is room in the market for both systems. </p><p><em>Verdict on competition: </em>The stiffest competition Intuitive faces in the near term is CMR surgical which has launched in Europe and is competing for placements in government hospitals. It is cheaper and could win some bids. I expect Intuitive's growth to continue although at a slower rate than the overall robotic surgery market as different hospitals trial new systems. With robotic surgery still early innings, there are many opportunities for new robots to enter the market. Short term disruption is unlikely, but larger competitors have the salesforce/network to sell the robot once developed. Intuitive must keep innovating even if it's a monopoly right now. </p><h1>Financials</h1><p>Putting some numbers to the story. </p><p><strong>Historical Numbers </strong></p><p>The numbers are phenomenal.

From a market share perspective (assuming 2-4% procedure growth in line with population growth/international markets developing), they end up capturing 23% of the total target market of 20 million procedures. </p><p>Assuming Robotic surgery grows to 30% of all surgery from the current 3-5%, taking share away from open surgery while laparascopy holds stable, Intuitive would then have 75% of the robotic market in 2030. Accounting for new competition and the current moat, a 75% market share is reasonable. Now what if we bump up the system growth numbers up to 12 and 17% for US/OUS respectively, and utilization growth per system up to 6%. Intuitive then captures 30% of the target 20 million soft tissue surgery procedures and has revenue growth of 18% into 2030</p><p>To achieve 20% revenue growth for 10 years, Intuitive must capture ~35% of the target soft-tissue procedure market (assuming margins, ASP, and revenue per procedure stay consistent). Even then the IRR is &lt; 15%. If you're buying Intuitive for &gt; 15% long term IRR, you're betting on increases in revenue per procedure, ASP, or expansion into new markets beyond robotic surgery. </p><p>If you shorten the model, and assume the same multiple compression, the risks become even higher. Intuitive might accelerate revenue in the short term with new markets but is too expensive long term. </p><p>Although great companies often surprise to the upside, Intuitive's valuation is too rich for me. Considering the 20% returns I aim for from other companies at the top of my portfolio such as TBTC and PFMT (writeups linked), Intuitive is a pass for me. However, if you are willing to take a long-term time horizon and are ok with average returns (8%), intuitive is a safe place to compound your capital. In addition, a short-term bet on accelerating revenue growth is possible too. </p><h1>Growth and Risks</h1><p>With a high valuation, the growth opportunities turn into risks as the onus is on Intuitive to exploit their growth opportunities which are priced into the stock. There are a few growth triggers and a fair amount of risk </p><p><strong>Growth Drivers</strong></p><p><em>Increasing installed base:</em> The stickiness of the surgical system means growing the installed base is a leading indicator of future revenue growth because hospitals only buy systems when they intend to use the system. Opportunities are available, especially in international markets, for Intuitive to place more systems, but each incremental sale increases in difficulty. Selling more systems to a single hospital is easier than selling to a new hospital (up to a point) but in general, each incremental system will be more difficult to sell. </p><p>In addition, smaller hospitals and outpatient centers currently don't buy Da Vinci Systems because they either don&#8217;t want to pay that much or don&#8217;t need a surgical robot. There is opportunity for Intuitive to innovate 'down the ladder' into smaller clinics but competition is steepest here and insurance reimburses less. &nbsp;</p><p><em>Increased revenue per procedure:</em> Since the revenue per procedure is a function of accessory instruments, some surgeries have higher costs. For example, Bariatric surgery typically fetches $3k while hernia surgery fetches $1k. As people push for lowering healthcare costs and Intuitive introduces longer lasting instruments, the revenue per procedure will <em>decrease. </em>In fact, recently introduced instruments can be used for 12-18 procedures (vs 10 for the older ones). Applying such a change retroactively would have hurt revenues by 7%. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8f343088-743e-46b4-9155-f8060b320e5e_374x480.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8f343088-743e-46b4-9155-f8060b320e5e_374x480.png" width="374" height="480" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8f343088-743e-46b4-9155-f8060b320e5e_374x480.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:480,&quot;width&quot;:374,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:503198,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8f343088-743e-46b4-9155-f8060b320e5e_374x480.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8f343088-743e-46b4-9155-f8060b320e5e_374x480.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8f343088-743e-46b4-9155-f8060b320e5e_374x480.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8f343088-743e-46b4-9155-f8060b320e5e_374x480.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><em>Expansion into other surgical procedures</em>: This is simple. Can Intuitive expand to new surgical indications and fully address all soft-tissue surgery? They certainly have the brand to sell any newly developed indications and cash to buy startups.</p><p>One risk is the creation of procedurally specific robotics such that each type of surgery could have its own surgical robot. This approach is feasible for larger hospital systems and specialized centers, but the enormity of Intuitive means this risk is minimal. </p><p><strong>Future Opportunities and Risks</strong></p><p><em>Better Robotic Surgery:</em> Here lies the greatest risk and greatest opportunity. AI, augmented reality, etc are buzzwords thrown around for many startups, but there lies real potential behind advanced robotic surgery. The robot could become more than a better tool for the surgeon. It could augment a surgeon&#8217;s capabilities. Cost and computing power will be limiting factors and any revolutionary tech will take time, but Intuitive has a distinct data advantage. <strong>BUZZWORD ALERT</strong>. Yet another "data advantage", Stay with me here, it does exist. </p><p>When over 1.2 million procedures are performed on the Da Vinci system each year they have quantitative and qualitative data on what does/does not work. Intuitive is well positioned to develop or acquire any new tech. </p><p>Improving robotic surgery is also a risk as innovation could disrupt Intuitive. If a speculative new company like Vicarious Surgical develops a groundbreaking robotic system in the next 5 years, we could see growth slow dramatically. </p><p><em>Lawsuits and Bad Behavior. </em>Axios <a href="https://www.axios.com/hospitals-are-taking-on-a-surgical-robot-monopoly-57b3d230-eff3-49a6-8300-4340bd8cee1f.html?utm_campaign=organic&amp;utm_medium=socialshare&amp;utm_source=twitter">highlights</a> lawsuits against Intuitive Surgical citing an abuse of monopoly power. Intuitive allegedly threatens hospitals to shut down robotic systems, &#8216;forces&#8217; them to buy overpriced instruments, and restricts hospitals against third-party repair services. Litigation, whether it&#8217;s for patent infringement, patient safety, or even antitrust, is nothing new, but increased scrutiny is certainly not a good thing. Although, they might not lose these lawsuits, the larger risk is a break in the hospital relationship leading to an increased willingness to switch systems. While they did originally sell robots by abusing their power, they have tried to be more mutually aggregable with hospitals. </p><h1>Lessons</h1><p><em>Lessons from my research</em></p><p>Lesson A) Patients are not passive actors: In healthcare, we ascribe adoption of revolutionary treatments to doctors and hospitals, but patients are a key driver of demand. With the invention of the internet, patients have swaths of information at their fingertips and are empowered to ask for treatments from their doctor. Patient demand for robotic surgery was key to driving growth. Great healthcare companies can be driven by patients. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F938818f4-aee1-4b66-8511-430e6f36dd82_300x256.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F938818f4-aee1-4b66-8511-430e6f36dd82_300x256.png" width="300" height="256" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/938818f4-aee1-4b66-8511-430e6f36dd82_300x256.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:256,&quot;width&quot;:300,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:236925,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F938818f4-aee1-4b66-8511-430e6f36dd82_300x256.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F938818f4-aee1-4b66-8511-430e6f36dd82_300x256.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F938818f4-aee1-4b66-8511-430e6f36dd82_300x256.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F938818f4-aee1-4b66-8511-430e6f36dd82_300x256.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Lesson B) To quote Charlie Munger: "Show me the incentives and I'll show you the outcome". In this case, the incentives driving outcomes were not for management but for the customers in the ecosystem. Doctors were dually incentivized with 1) better outcomes in the case of prostatectomy and hysterectomy and 2) more comfort in the surgical process. Hospitals were incentivized with more patient demand, doctor demand, and possibly better long-term outcomes (since hospital stays/readmissions are so expensive). Patients were incentivized by less pain and quicker recovery to get robotic surgery. All these combined to drive growth for Intuitive. Incentives need not be explicit either. They are often subtle mindsets of decision makers. </p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F135b16a6-5336-49ba-acdb-f9c4e8c0c978_300x226.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F135b16a6-5336-49ba-acdb-f9c4e8c0c978_300x226.png" width="300" height="226" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/135b16a6-5336-49ba-acdb-f9c4e8c0c978_300x226.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:226,&quot;width&quot;:300,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:90275,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F135b16a6-5336-49ba-acdb-f9c4e8c0c978_300x226.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F135b16a6-5336-49ba-acdb-f9c4e8c0c978_300x226.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F135b16a6-5336-49ba-acdb-f9c4e8c0c978_300x226.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F135b16a6-5336-49ba-acdb-f9c4e8c0c978_300x226.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p></p><p>Lesson C) the best businesses are often those that struggle and come out on top. Everyone is always enamored with the newest asset-lite startup, built on a laptop, backed by easy venture capital money, but I like my businesses tough to build with some struggle behind them. A difficult to start business is a difficult to disrupt business. There are examples where one company can pave the way for others by struggling through creating a market, but a capital heavy model and difficult to create product minimizes disruption risk. See the troubles at any of the competitors (Integrated surgical systems, Medtronic, J&amp;J, Transenterix, etc.). </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Q2 Portfolio Update and thoughts on borrowed Ideas]]></title><description><![CDATA[An update on my portfolio.

Here, I want to discuss another relevant topic, especially with my recent post on Performant Financial. </p><p>&#8220;Being first to a stock doesn't make you better at making money. &#8220;</p><p>About a month ago, I started to fall into a trap: looking past companies because they had recently run-up in price. I wanted to find the most obscure, least analyzed company out there so I could be "first". I equated being first to being the best. As someone who published his work, being first lends some credibility but the goal of any investor is to make money. No one cares if you're first or if you come up with some unique insight if you don't make money. </p><p>&nbsp;Sure, one derives satisfaction from being the first to an insight, but it isn't the ultimate goal. </p><p>I would argue being first can actually detract from long term returns if you're too early. Let's look at a very popular former microcap: XPEL. With XPEL, you had the opportunity to buy at the same prices in 2015 and 2018 in the low $3's/share. Early wasn't necessarily better. Beyond that, if one analyzed XPEL in 2019 at 6$ after appreciating 400% from 2018, one could dismiss the stock as overvalued with little further upside. "Bah, it's already run-up so much, can it be worth that much more?" This would be amongst the largest mistakes of omission of an investor's career with XPEL at &gt;80$/share right now. </p><p>&nbsp;Past performance isn't indicative of future performance in a stock. Businesses and stocks should be separated when doing fundamental analysis. Sure, business history is relevant, but stock history isn't. Many investors, including me, fall into a trap of assuming a hot stock has little room left to run. This isn't always the case. Price anchoring is a killer vice.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3591ae46-1d3e-4834-88e6-214f329e6834_500x532.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3591ae46-1d3e-4834-88e6-214f329e6834_500x532.png" width="500" height="532" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3591ae46-1d3e-4834-88e6-214f329e6834_500x532.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:532,&quot;width&quot;:500,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3591ae46-1d3e-4834-88e6-214f329e6834_500x532.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3591ae46-1d3e-4834-88e6-214f329e6834_500x532.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3591ae46-1d3e-4834-88e6-214f329e6834_500x532.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3591ae46-1d3e-4834-88e6-214f329e6834_500x532.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Performant Financial, the stock I wrote about most recently inspired these thoughts.

Also added to the portfolio was TableTrac (TBTC), which I also <a href="https://adus.substack.com/p/tabletrac-tbtc">wrote about</a>. Even up 50%, I think TableTrac represents a fantastic Risk/Reward, but a lack of liquidity prevents me from building a huge position. Overall, the top 5 positions make up 44% of the portfolio (vs 43% in April) and the top 10 positions make up ~70% of the portfolio (vs 62% in April). </p><p>One addition I have not written about is Data I/O (DAIO), a manufacturer of programming systems for semiconductors. Historically, they sold equipment to chip manufacturers and were subject to semiconductor cycles with no recurring revenue. They tried changing the business to add recurring revenue by adding the ability to program security and price based on volumes. This shift diversifies the customer base and stabilizes the revenue. Data I/O's potential switch from a cyclical equipment manufacturer to a recurring revenue business has excited investors since 2018 (look at Long Cast Advisor's <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/581274a0f5e231316b7c8224/t/5c0a97150e2e7247df3578f9/1544197909611/DAIO+SumZero+report+FINAL.pdf">pitch</a> and other <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4243957-data-i-o-is-long-term-buy">Seeking Alpha articles</a>). The thesis fits an often successful framework of a business transition from one time sales to recurring revenue. (IDN, RSSS both fit this bill). However, uptake of the new systems was slow and coincided with a downcycle in semis so the thesis failed to play out in 2018. Now, the company is at the start of an UPCYCLE in semis and I believe at an inflection point for selling the new systems (based on product development). It's cheap solely as a cyclical equipment manufacturer and the potential shift in business is just icing on the cake. I still need to put together a model and will write it up when I can better quantify the opportunity or the stock drops to a level where the pitch is too fat to ignore. </p><p>Another smaller addition was Thunderbird Entertainment (THBRF). A quick twitter search will reveal lots of writeups, but the overall thesis is straightforward. They produce content in an age where streaming content sells at a premium. They are building an IP portfolio to monetize outside of purely producing and selling content.

After seeing him reply numerous times to people I follow, encouraging them to look at $PFMT, I took a look and even with the recent run-up, it's still got room to run. </p><p>TLDR: Performant historically recovered defaulted student loans and other wrong payments. Over the past decade, they have transformed their business and are now focused on recovering erroneous healthcare payments and catching fraud/waste in the healthcare ecosystem. The healthcare business is a high growth, high margin business, obscured by the historical business and large amounts of debt. Performant is undervalued based on recent acquisition multiples, is gaining market share, and can return 4x over the next 5 years (IRR ~ 32%). </p><h2><strong>What does the company do? </strong></h2><p>Historically, the company provided financial recovery services to government clients ranging from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the Department of Education, and State Tax departments. Performant uses a combination of data analytics and people to find and recover erroneously made payments or defaulted payments. For example: they would be the person to recover any defaulted student loans. When it IPO'd, &gt;60% of the business came from recovering student loans, but <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/1962191-performant-financial-short-48-percent-downside-extrapolation-from-slm-conference-call-results-in-a-41-percent-reduction-in-eps-estimate">legislation in the early 2010s</a> killed their business. In short, Performant's customers received less funding from the government to recover student loan assets and the government took an increasing share of the student loan market. They lost contracts as customers looked to other, more full service vendors. However, this part of Performant&#8217;s story is hardly relevant to the current bull thesis, considering they recently sold these assets to grow the healthcare business and pay off debt. The CEO has been in place since 2002, so the dicey company history may dissuade investors, but the downturn was created by regulatory factors outside of Performant's control (i.e. government regulation). They have always had a best in class technology platform and efficient workflows and are now leveraging that technology combined with experience recovering payments to grow in the healthcare vertical. </p><h3><strong>Healthcare Business: </strong></h3><p>Performant's healthcare business dates back to the early 2000s and even did nearly $70 million in revenue in 2013. They were a Medicare Recovery audit contractor (explained later) and had not entered the commercial market significantly. In 2014, legislation hindered Performant's ability to adequately audit providers effectively destroying their business. In addition, rebidding for the Medicare contract hurt their ability to do business as the bidding process partially restricted their access to medical records. However, since dropping from $67 million in 2013 to $10 million 2017, the Performant's healthcare revenue is back up to $68 million in 2020 on the back of investment into their tech and diversification into private insurance. </p><p><em>What is a Recovery Audit Contractors (RAC)? &nbsp;</em>A recovery audit contractor is used by Medicare to review suspicious claims and ensure the right insurance is being billed. Insurance fraud is rare, but waste and misuse is common, thus RAC contractors are necessary to catch provider who misbill items. Currently, Performant serves 2 of 5 regions for Medicare, the Northeast region and a 5th 'region' of nationwide Durable Medical Equipment/Home Health (DME/HHE) claims. </p><h3><strong>Performant's services: </strong></h3><p>Performant also serves Medicaid (through managed care organizations<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a>) and commercial insurers. The upshot of their offerings are all similar: <em><strong>Performant analyzes claims data to find improperly billed claims and recovers lost dollars by pursuing those who may have benefited and the doctors who misbilled the treatment. They are a payment integrity company that ensures payments are correct. Performant then sends the money back to their customers and takes a cut (typically 10%). </strong></em></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d034674-0731-4430-b3cb-466824b86496_596x500.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d034674-0731-4430-b3cb-466824b86496_596x500.jpeg" width="596" height="500" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9d034674-0731-4430-b3cb-466824b86496_596x500.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:500,&quot;width&quot;:596,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&#932;&#927; GET \nWASTEO &#924;&#927;&#925;&#917;&#933; BACK &quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="&#932;&#927; GET

Performant's been able to gain traction with insurance because of they offer a great solution for payment integrity regarding Durable Medical Equipment (DME) and outpatient claims. They use their experience with Medicare to create easy to integrate, effective technology to catch waste. Another competitive advantage stems from a company culture that helps them be aggressive in recovering any lost money. Even when competitors identify larger amounts in fraud, Performant could return more to the insurance company via their ability to collect. Recovering is half of 'find and recover' and Performant does it well. Based on expert calls and case studies from management, Performant's solution is better than other vendors at returning wasted dollars. </p><h2>The Industry </h2><h3><strong>Industry TAM: </strong></h3><p>The amount of medical waste in the system is absolutely gigantic and TAM concerns aren't top of the risk profile for Performant as a $200m company. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4c36b95-26c4-46fc-a4b7-b393d7880f3f_1494x933.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4c36b95-26c4-46fc-a4b7-b393d7880f3f_1494x933.png" width="1456" height="909" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d4c36b95-26c4-46fc-a4b7-b393d7880f3f_1494x933.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:909,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Employer \nCommercial \nSponsored \nMedicare \nAdvantage \nMedicare \nFee-For-Service \nManaged \nMedicaid \nMedicaid \nFee -For-Service \n2019 spend \n$1,344B \n5407B \n5450B \n5405B \n$270B \nInaccurate \nPayments \n-$818 \n-$298 \n-$32B \n-$608 \n-$408 \n% Inaccurate \n6.0% \n7.1% \n7.1% \n14.9% \n14.9% \nPerformant's market opportunity is between 10 and 15% of the total amount of \ninaccurate payments &quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Employer

With a 10% take rate, this puts the TAM at 20B. Looking closer at just Performant's key markets, Medicare FFS and managed Medicaid, the TAM is ~9B for payment integrity solutions. One can look at companies like HMS, Change healthcare, Equian, Optum, and Covitity to see the potential opportunity. </p><h3><strong>Industry Makeup: </strong></h3><p>Performant's major competitors are Optum health and their subsidiaries like Change and HMS/Covititi. As evidenced by recent deals(Optum acquires <a href="https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/optum-acquire-change-healthcare">Change</a> and <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/2019/06/21/unitedhealth-acquires-payment-integrity-company-equian/#.YN5MVehKhEE">Equian</a><strong>, </strong>Covititi acquires <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hms-holdings-hmsy-acquired-gainwell-135401040.html">HMS</a>), the industry is consolidating. The makeup of the industry is such that insurance companies often employ multiple vendors to serve different point purposes. Rather than choosing a single vendor, insurance companies are at multiple restaurants, using numerous vendors for breakfast lunch and desert. The bigger players in the space have started to buy out the smaller ones to be the one stop shop for insurance companies. This hurts Performant as customers may choose to go with a more full service offering, but at the end of the day, market share is driven by performance. Even if customers choose to go with larger players for a more full-service offering, the insurance company incurs minimal costs to give Performant data to analyze and recover. Often the system is tiered where companies at the top of the list get first pass at the data but smaller companies get a section to analyze, or a second pass to catch any additional fraud. Larger insurance companies may employ all the potential payment integrity vendors!</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1919f50b-9ac4-4efa-ac7f-551cb5f7e3ff_2091x846.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1919f50b-9ac4-4efa-ac7f-551cb5f7e3ff_2091x846.png" width="1456" height="589" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1919f50b-9ac4-4efa-ac7f-551cb5f7e3ff_2091x846.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:589,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Claims Data is sent \nInsurance Company \nMedicare \nCommercial \nMedicaid \nWaste \nVendor 1: Optum \nVendor 2: HMS systems \nrecovered and sent back; vendors take \na cut (typically 10%) \nVendor 3: Performant \nTiered System where each Vendor serves a purpose \nand catches different data \nLower tiers have less opportunity to capture waste &quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Claims Data is sent

Systems are often relationship driven and slow to adapt (especially healthcare), but the payment integrity space is slightly different. Once you've got a foot in the door, it's up to your performance to swing it open. The process to switch vendor tiers can take up to 18 months, but once given access to claims data, newer companies can analyze the data pitch potential savings to the insurance company. when upselling, a vendor would cite claims they would have caught if given the chance at a higher tier. Beyond just the aforementioned algorithms and collections capabilities, having a base set of insurance data on people is key to creating a successful solution. Performant was able to use their experience as a RAC to sell themselves, but any new competitor would have to go through extensive regulation and need to prove themselves somehow before being adopted. </p><p>The system is setup such that Performant doesn't compete on price. Companies usually follow standard pricing and even if competition attempted to undercut Performant, Insurance companies have little incentive to switch and save chump change. They would rather pay up and capture more waste. </p><p><em>Why not in-house? </em>Ah, the age old question, with all the data generated by insurance companies, why not in-house the solution? UnitedHealth is certainly trying, using Optum, a division of theirs to gobble up payment integrity vendors such as Equian and Change healthcare. However, an issue arises when asking a competing insurer like Humana to hand over data to Optum, a subsidiary of United Health for the explicit purpose of analyzing it. The incentives just don't align. In addition, insurance companies don't have the necessary skills to develop a solution, but do have the cash to pay for one. As long as the ROI stays high, insurance companies will gladly outsource their payment integrity solutions. </p><h3><strong>Industry Tailwinds: </strong></h3><p>Numerous tailwinds exist for the industry with medical waste on the rise. Coding is becoming more complex, thus errors are becoming more common. The move to home-based care also increases the likelihood of waste and creates headaches for insurance providers without a way to track services offered, especially in situations where the patient may not have control over their facilities (very sick patients, late stage dementia). </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F54142869-aac3-42a1-9cca-8a7eb3543778_667x374.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F54142869-aac3-42a1-9cca-8a7eb3543778_667x374.jpeg" width="667" height="374" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/54142869-aac3-42a1-9cca-8a7eb3543778_667x374.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:374,&quot;width&quot;:667,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&#921; MISSEO &#932;&#919;&#917; EPISOOE WHERE &#932;&#919;&#917;&#933; \n&#932;&#927; &#932;&#927; &#914;&#921;&#921;&#921; PROCEOllRES \nimgfOcom &quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="&#921; MISSEO &#932;&#919;&#917; EPISOOE WHERE &#932;&#919;&#917;&#933;

Since Performant currently serves MCOs, this shift increases their potential business and consolidates the customer base, thus making it easier to sell their services. (they would sell to one insurance instead of 10 states)</p><h2>Why this opportunity exists? </h2><h3><strong>Optically bad financial statements </strong></h3><p><em><strong>Recent deal and Debt refinance:</strong> </em>The first thing that catches the eye on the recent 10k is 60M in 'current debt' supposedly due in August 2021. This looks extremely bad, but with <a href="https://www.performantcorp.com/investors/news/press-release-details/2021/Performant-Financial-Corporation-Announces-Strategic-Initiatives-to-Focus-on-Healthcare/default.aspx">a recent deal</a>, the debt expense isn&#8217;t as bad as on paper. They extended the due date out a year with the option to extend it for two more and paid off 6 million of it to reduce payments. The deal sold their recovery assets and reduced the Net Debt to ~40 million, a more manageable amount. It also offered additional shares and amended the deal on warrants held by the debt holder (ECMC). Overall, I wouldn't expect the debt to catch up to the company causing it to fail since ECMC owns 10% of the shares outstanding and is incentivized to keep the company going. With strong FCF generation and the ability to issue new shares, they should be able to manage the debt</p><p><em><strong>Student Loan Forgiveness: </strong></em>When your business relies on pursuing those who miss student loan payments and there is a moratorium on those payments, s*** hits the fan. Performant's loan recovery business took a huge hit last year which caused the overall revenue to dip, although healthcare revenues were strong. </p><p><em><strong>Lack of Profitability:</strong> </em>Starting in 2018, the company spent heavily to build their healthcare technology reducing near term profitability. In addition, a $27 million goodwill impairment and the hit the recovery business took caused a significant reduction in net income for 2020. All of this obscures the high margin nature of the healthcare business. As a technology driven platform, the mature EBITDA margins would likely be around 30% (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4428552-performant-financial-corp-pfmt-ceo-lisa-im-on-q1-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript">source: Q1 Earnings Call</a>). </p><h2><strong>Future Growth: </strong></h2><p>Performant's current offering is clearly gaining traction among insurers as revenue growth is faster than the industry's overall mid-single digit growth. The dynamics of the growth are also in Performant's favor. They are just starting to gain traction with payors in different markets meaning they are on the lowest tier, left to go through the scraps of other competitors. If Performant can demonstrate superiority of their solution, they can move up tiers and capture more business. TO move up tiers, Performant should offer a more holistic solution within payment integrity which management is building. In addition, they need to </p><p><em><strong>New payors:</strong></em><strong> </strong>Performant can also expand to new customers such as Medicare Advantage Payors, state Medicaid payors, and smaller insurance companies. They recently launched a Medicare Advantage offering that gained traction quickly. Their reputation will help them sell new products and the technology based nature of the platform makes integration into a system easy once a sale is completed. </p><p><em><strong>New Services: </strong></em>Another seemingly obvious step is to expand their offering horizontally to encompass new services beyond just payment integrity. However, This would be a mistake in my opinion. With a leading niche offering and a runway for growth within their current offering, expanding horizontally at this time would open them up to well-capitalized competition. For the next couple years, they should focus on penetrating their current market and investing in the infrastructure to offer better payment integrity services. </p><h2><strong>Valuing the business: </strong></h2><p>Chris Krug lays out a simple valuation on the most recent earnings call:</p><p>HMS, a mature competitor, was acquired for 17x EBITDA as a steady-state mid single digit grower with ~25% EBITDA margins. If Performant continues to grow at 30%, they will have 150 million in 2023 revenue. At 30% EBITDA margins and a 17x Multiple, the market cap is ~$850 million (Price/share = $15.5). That's 4x the current share price and an IRR of 60% over 3 years. Pretty damn good upside. Even if you take their current revenue of 68 million, apply a 25% EBITDA margin and 15x multiple, the target share price = $4.63 </p><p>We can also do a slightly more in depth model with a sensitivity analysis, modelling out any debt payment and reinvestment. Based on EBITDA margins at maturity and revenue growth, the 5 year CAGR is as follows. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc0bee247-8a72-45a9-a0a5-0dba3a3cbcf3_1171x314.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc0bee247-8a72-45a9-a0a5-0dba3a3cbcf3_1171x314.png" width="1171" height="314" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c0bee247-8a72-45a9-a0a5-0dba3a3cbcf3_1171x314.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:314,&quot;width&quot;:1171,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:44672,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc0bee247-8a72-45a9-a0a5-0dba3a3cbcf3_1171x314.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc0bee247-8a72-45a9-a0a5-0dba3a3cbcf3_1171x314.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc0bee247-8a72-45a9-a0a5-0dba3a3cbcf3_1171x314.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc0bee247-8a72-45a9-a0a5-0dba3a3cbcf3_1171x314.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>That's a whole lotta upside if they can execute well. </p><p><em>What about the Debt?</em></p><p>Looking at the Debt expense, we can model out if they can get rid of the debt by 2024.

Competitive bidding is an auction for DME suppliers that happens every three years. Instead of setting      reimbursement&nbsp; via panel, Medicare allows companies bid to supply DME to Medicare beneficiaries. Whoever wins the bid gets the contract and is paid their bidding price with suppliers usually being awarded bids for local areas. Medicare can also extend those bid rates nationwide and cut/raise reimbursement across the country.

More recently, a <a href="https://www.sleepscholar.com/cpap-takes-47-medicare-reimbursement-cut/">50% cut to CPAP reimbursement</a> after the 2017 bidding program hurt smaller suppliers and consolidated the supplier base. Lots of industry members argue against the competitive bidding process, but it is curbing healthcare costs, leveraging the market power Medicare holds as the largest payor. Medicare is using its near monopsony (single buyer) power and <a href="https://healthpayerintelligence.com/news/competitive-bidding-curbs-medicare-durable-medical-equipment-costs">driving down costs via capitalism</a>, a positive development for the saga of healthcare cost inflation (similar to what a single payor system might do) . Though Medicare cuts are a risk for all DME suppliers, Viemed's position as a larger, specialized supplier of ventilators can keep it open and may even drive more business to them in the case of a reimbursement cut. Even so, Viemed effectively lobbied to have ventilators taken off of the 2021 bidding schedule with bipartisan support from congress through the <a href="https://www.homecaremag.com/december-2019/smart-act-hr4945">SMART Act</a> (written before the pandemic). Clearly people recognize the value of home ventilation, but I wouldn't put this risk in the rearview mirror. The <a href="https://medtrade.com/news/legislative-advocacy/cms-removes-non-invasive-ventilators-from-2021-competitive-bidding-program/">#1 reason cited by Medicare</a> for the removal of ventilators from the bidding program is the pandemic and need for ventilators during the crisis. Without such a crisis in 2024, don't be surprised to see it back on the bidding list. This risk may have been merely delayed. </p></li><li><p><strong>Types of Ventilation: </strong>One relevant difference to discuss is the types of ventilation. There are three types of at home ventilation: continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP, also called Respiratory assist devices (RAD)), and home mechanical ventilation (HMV). All of these machines work by pushing air into the lungs. The major difference between CPAP and BiPAP machines are that BiPAP machines have different pressure settings for inhalation and exhalation. HMV machines are similar to BiPAPs, but are portable and meant to be akin to home life support used in conjunction with a respiratory therapist. CPAP machines are intended for those with sleep apnea, but BiPAP machines are intended with patients with more severe cases or even those with COPD. HMV is solely for chronic respiratory failure as a result of COPD and is the primary type of ventilator Viemed sells. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9ab864e-c72c-4d2c-beba-0da3f5b8e16d_1281x1153.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9ab864e-c72c-4d2c-beba-0da3f5b8e16d_1281x1153.png" width="1281" height="1153" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b9ab864e-c72c-4d2c-beba-0da3f5b8e16d_1281x1153.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1153,&quot;width&quot;:1281,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Table 1: Noninvasive Home Ventilator, Respiratory Assist Device, and \nContinuous Positive Airway Pressure Device Medicare Coverage Comparison \nDevice \nNHV \nRAD&#8226; \nCPAP \nConditions Treated \nCovered for treatment Of \nneuromuscular diseases, \nthoracic restrictive diseases, \nand chronic respiratory \nfailure consequent to COPD. \nCovered for restrictive \nthoracic disorders,' severe \nCOPD, central sleep apnea, \ncomplex sleep apnea, or \nhypoventilation syndrome. \nAdditional Information About Medicare \ncove \nVentilator-related disease groups overlap \nconditions used to determine coverage for \nRADS.

The indications for BiPAPs and HMVs overlap! The jump from a CPAP machine to a BiPAP machine is clear in the scientific literature, but the "differences between a BiPAP or a RAD and a home mechanical ventilator are really quite subtle and blurred." (<a href="https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/FACA/downloads/id77c.pdf">Page 158</a>, Dr. Neil MacIntyre).<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a> However, the payment for each is very different creating an incentive for Viemed to get reimbursed for HMVs. BiPAP devices are reimbursed at a monthly rate of $40-$394 and capped at a max rental of 13 months, but HMVs are reimbursed at ~$1000/month and are uncapped in terms of length. Because of this difference in cost but a lack of major differences between devices, Medicare convened a <a href="https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/details/medcac-meeting-details.aspx?MEDCACId=77#">panel</a> last July to review at-home ventilation of COPD patients. </p></li><li><p><strong>MEDCAC panel: </strong>the Medicare Evidence Development and Coverage Advisory Committee (MEDCAC) advises Medicare on guidelines for reimbursement. Last July, they convened a panel with experts in COPD, Medicare representatives, and industry experts (including Viemed Chief Medical Officer William Frazier) to discuss at home ventilation for COPD. This <a href="https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/details/medcac-meeting-details.aspx?MEDCACId=77#">page</a> has the <a href="http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/FACA/downloads/id77b.pdf">meeting minutes</a>, <a href="http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/FACA/downloads/id77c.pdf">transcript</a> and <a href="http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/FACA/downloads/id77a.pdf">voting scoresheet</a> for the meeting. After reading the transcript, I had a few takeaways:</p><p>A) the difference between BiPAP machines and HMVs is small and there is no scientific literature comparing the two. Both have been shown to be effective for COPD patients. One member likened it to taking a Tesla vs a Honda to reach a destination, HMVs are much fancier and might not provide any additional benefits (<a href="https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/FACA/downloads/id77c.pdf">page 157</a>, Dr. Coleman). </p><p>B) It's actually easier to get prescribed a HMV than a BiPAP machine. Speaking about physicians:</p><blockquote><p>"they are getting in some ways kind of encouraged to do home mechanical ventilation, it's easier to meet that criteria&#8230; the criteria is less stringent and if you'd go through all of those things with a BiPAP sheet, I think it would be more readily prescribed" (<a href="https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/FACA/downloads/id77c.pdf">Page 130,</a> Dr Coleman). </p><p>"So criteria currently in the United States, giving somebody a Bi-Pap machine or a respiratory assist device is&#8230;..very challenging, so instead you can just do a blood gas and call someone hypercapnic and get them a HMV. They are using the same type of support" (<a href="https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/FACA/downloads/id77c.pdf">page 155</a>). BiPAP machines can even be used in a hospital and are used in lieu of ventilators in developing countries.</p></blockquote><p>C) Physicians may choose HMV because of the support services rather than the actual device needs. (<a href="https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/FACA/downloads/id77c.pdf">page 128</a>, Dr. Macintyre). </p><p>The <a href="http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/FACA/downloads/id77a.pdf">answers to the questions</a> didn't inspire confidence with scores barely reaching the threshold of 2.5/5 in 3/4 questions. The panel members were most confident that use of at home ventilation was beneficial, but are unclear on device choice and even more unclear if improvements in patient conditions are due to the device or additional support. If a physician wants extra support for the patient, they'll choose HMV for the respiratory therapist rather than the device. </p><p>D) Viemed&#8217;s chiefs medical officer, William Frazier, was often a contrarian arguing in favor of HMV (no surprise there, Viemed makes most of their money on HMV). At one point he even starts his point with "This is Bill Frazier again being a contrarian" (<a href="https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/FACA/downloads/id77c.pdf">page 183</a>). Throughout the transcript he tries to differentiate between HMVs and BiPAPs. According to Frazier, for the most part RADs aren't indicated for chronic respiratory failure by the FDA (<a href="https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/FACA/downloads/id77c.pdf">page 159</a>) and possible higher pressure from HMVs could make a difference (<a href="https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/FACA/downloads/id77c.pdf">page 177</a>), but others point out that BiPAPs are used in hospitals and even as a possible substitute for ventilators in low income settings (<a href="https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/FACA/downloads/id77c.pdf">page 156-7</a>). Frazier seems to be lone wolf when arguing for a stark difference between HMVs and BiPAPs. </p></li><li><p><strong>OIG Audit: </strong>All this lack of clarity and <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-12-15-00370.pdf">increase in costs</a> led the office of the inspector general to <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region4/41804066.pdf">audit Viemed's insurance claims</a>. They sampled 100 claims and found 98 were billed incorrectly for HMV use when a BiPAP (RAD) would have sufficed. Viemed <a href="https://www.hmenews.com/article/viemed-pushes-back-on-oig-s-findings">responded</a> and the OIGs response to Viemed's response is noted in the audit PDF. </p><p>The OIG recommended Viemed refund $29 million in overpayments back to Medicare. Both sides have some legitimate qualms but I think Viemed won't have to pay the $29 million. To me, the OIG's report looks like wishful thinking because of the overlap in indications for RADs and HMVs. The OIG cites a number of issues with the claims such as minimal use of HMV devices at home (sometimes only 10 minutes/day), prescription of HMV immediately after hospitalization (<a href="https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.202006-2382ST#_i47">some recommend</a> waiting for 2-4 weeks to prescribe a HMV), and inadequate medical testing and documentation (blood gas testing, etc.). These are all concerns in relation to overtreatment and increased costs but may not matter for the refund. There are no guidelines for minimum treatment per day (though 10 minutes is very low for a life support-like device) or a clear recommendation on when to prescribe HMV after hospitalization (E<a href="https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/54/3/1901003">uropean guidelines</a> differ from the weak <a href="https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.202006-2382ST#_i47">recommendation to wait in the USA</a>) . A lack of medical documentation could be damning, but 89 independent physicians made these 100 claims. What are the chances nearly 100% of them were wrong? In reality, the low barrier to get HMV contributed to the large number of prescriptions. Since the conditions for needing a RAD and HMV heavily overlap, the device choice is up to physician discretion. </p><p><em>My takeaway from the report is this</em>: although Viemed won't have to pay the refund, it shines a light on the BiPAP vs HMV debate possibly causing Medicare to refine guidelines and make it harder to get HMVs. In all honesty, I think the guidelines should be refined to reduce the costs of treatment and reflect the often low device usage and minimal differences between HMVs and RADs. </p></li><li><p><strong>Final Thoughts: </strong>The whole saga is a classic case study in healthcare inflation. A new treatment with promising potential ends up increasing costs for everyone through overtreatment because costs are neither felt by the patient nor the doctor. Since physicians are playing with house money, they have no qualms giving patient a doubly expensive treatment even if may not provide any additional benefit. In this specific case, we need more data comparing HMV and BiPAP machines. With only minimal differences in device abilities, I wouldn't expect a large difference in outcomes when equating for respiratory therapist support. Although I agree with removing NIVs from the Competitive Bidding process since HMVs require services and support and are basically home life support, the guidelines deserve revision. The spotlight is squarely on the guidelines for HMV use and represent a large risk if reimbursement is cut or the guidelines for use become more stringent (<a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-12-15-00370.pdf">Report 1</a>, <a href="https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/details/medcac-meeting-details.aspx?MEDCACId=77#">meeting</a>, <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region4/41804066.pdf">Report 2</a>). </p><p>That said, I still own a little bit of Viemed. It's just too cheap considering their network of RTs and possible upside with remote patient monitoring possibilities. On the flip side, one could argue the consistent Medicare risk prevents the stock from rerating and it's appropriately priced. I own it in small size &lt; 1% just because it's so darn cheap. I would add if they can diversify their business while maintaining margins and would cut it if they were either forced to refund the overpayments or Medicare sentiment takes a turn for the worse.</p><p>Let me know what you guys think.

Viemed has a best in class service offering with a target market of 1.25 million people that is less than 10% penetrated.

They go through a lot of good information regarding the business, the risks, and the opportunity </p><p>There is quite a bit to unpack so I wanted to break it into two parts instead of dumping in all into one post. The first part will cover the business, competitive advantages, management, and valuation (all the typical things in a stock pitch), while the second part will dive deeper into the medical aspects of the company including pricing risk from Medicare, the recent audit from the OIG, and the different types of home ventilation. </p><p>Let's get started. </p><h3><strong>Business:</strong></h3><p>Viemed is a durable medical equipment (DME) company specializing in at home ventilation. They were spun out of Protech Home Medical (Now Quipt Home Medical Corp) in 2016 and have since grown to be larger than their former parent company with a market cap of ~$300M. Thought they have expanded their product offering, the core business is selling non-invasive ventilators (NIV) and respiratory therapist services to stage 4 COPD patients with chronic respiratory failure. They don't manufacture the ventilators themselves and focus on delivery of care unlike other DME companies such as Apria and Lincare. They service 45 of 50 states as of the last quarter. Future growth will come from penetrating new markets (they entered 6 states last year) and adjacent products in the remote patient monitoring (RPM) or DME space that can either developed or acquired. </p><h3><strong>Home Non-Invasive Ventilation TAM</strong></h3><p>Home ventilation, in Viemed's case, means bringing life support into the home. There are two classes of ventilation devices: Respiratory Assist devices (RADs) like BiPAPs and Mechanical Ventilators.&nbsp; Part two will dive deeper into the difference between two classes but the important part is that reimbursement for HMVs is ~1000/month, which is the primary device Viemed sells. Looking at the investor presentation, the company estimated TAM is 1.25 million people who have Chronic Respiratory failure from COPD. With an approximate $950/month per patient (Investor presentation), the TAM is ~14.25B.

In Viemed's case, churn is simply patients dying (they call it the 'patient attrition rate'). There is no way around it: there are a finite number of patients who can use the device and although the revenue is recurring monthly, the rate of churn makes it akin to selling hardware. In addition, the identified 1.25 million target patients includes all COPD patients with chronic respiratory failure which could overestimate the TAM. Some may not be eligible for HMV and the overall TAM could be shrinking as smoking rates have drastically lowered in the past couple decades.</p><p><em><strong>At-Home Care of Chronic Respiratory Failure</strong>:</em> Respiratory failure is when a patient cannot get enough oxygen and need help with an external device that pushes air into the lungs. Due to years of smoking, people's airways can become damaged leading to a chronic disease where they can have constant issues breathing. When a patient at home without support has a breathing issue, they are hospitalized to be ventilated which costs a metric ton of money. Viemed wants to bring this ventilation into the home so patients aren't hospitalized, in theory saving the healthcare system money. Looking at some of the data, at home ventilation does seem to save the hospital system money (<a href="https://www.ajmc.com/view/home-initiation-of-chronic-noninvasive-ventilation-in-patients-with-copd-as-safe-but-cheaper-than-inhospital-initiation">source 1</a>, <a href="https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/52/suppl_62/PA1676">source 2</a>) when comparing either BiPAPs or HMVs to no device at all. </p><h3>Competitive Advantages</h3><p><em><strong>Competitive Advantage 1:</strong> </em>As a potentially large and lucrative market, there are competitors but the home ventilation market is different than typical DME products. Typical DME suppliers focus on devices that don't require extensive monitoring (think walkers and even oxygen tanks) or the constant use of respiratory therapists (RTs) unlike at home ventilators. Viemed differentiates itself by being the best <em>service</em> provider through relationships with Respiratory therapists (RTs).

By specializing in the ventilator market, they can focus on provided the best services in a niche market rather than trying to source medical equipment. Viemed has the reputation to go into new markets and get RTs to join them. They also buy their equipment in bulk reducing costs and recycle older ventilators which drives down capital expenditures </p><p><em><strong>Optionality with Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM):</strong></em> Yes, I know that might trigger buzzword warnings for many, but I think Viemed has real substance in their ability to expand. Their network of RTs gives them optionality when adding new services and Viemed can enter the remote patient monitoring (RPM) space to help patients at home because of their current in home presence. In fact, they acquired a <a href="https://www.hmenews.com/article/viemed-acquires-stake-in-verustat">5% stake in Verustat</a> to do just that. RTs can check in with patients and use technology in addition to clinical judgement to make decisions in the home rather than in the clinic, all of which is brought together under Viemed. </p><h3><strong>Management: </strong></h3><p>Let's start with the good.

However, growth at in their Core ventilator business has been slowing and grew only 10% in Q121. Much of this can be attributed to COVID related slowdowns as patients can't get to the hospital and as we open up, management is targeting &gt;20% growth. </p><p>The margin profile looks generally nice with gross margins around 70% (normalized) and EBIT margins in the 10-20% range. The business is scalable as RTs can service several patients in one area, but it does require extensive work, capping their possible margins. With $30M in cash and no LT debt, the balance sheet is clean and provides them ample liquidity to make acquisitions. Overall, even though growth at the core business is slowing, the growth profile and margins of the business look nice, especially considering the valuation. </p><h3><strong>Valuation:</strong></h3><p>I could build out an elaborate DCF and try to model their bad debt expense and the potential growth within the target market along with any optionality&#8230;or I could tell you they aim to grow 20%+ per year and trades at a FCF multiple of &lt; 15x with a target market that is less than 10% penetrated. Without modelling it, I couldn't give you a precise price target, but if it can sustain that growth, it's clearly undervalued. Even if you back out the COVID related FCF (assuming it has the same margins as their vent business) the EV/FCF is still ~20x based on 2020 numbers, clearly undervalued. </p><h3><strong>Risks: </strong></h3><p>But the Moby Dick of all risks exist through an uncontrollable entity determining prices (and demand to a degree): Medicare. This risk extends beyond just pricing and I'll dive deeper into it in part 2 but here's a quick summary. Most of their patients are over 65 and pay Viemed through Medicare. If Medicare cuts pricing for at-home ventilators, Viemed has to make up for it through increased volume. Even if they are the lowest cost provider and will ultimately come out on top, the price cuts may still hurt growth. We have seen price cuts before (in 2017) and Viemed&nbsp; weathered that storm well. Although congress seems to want ventilators off of the competitive bidding process (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/4945?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22safeguarding+medicare+access+to+respiratory+therapy%22%5D%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=1">SMART act H.R. 4945</a>) and there are clear benefits to having at home ventilation, the <a href="https://www.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/research/findings/ta/hmv/hmv-ta-fullreport.pdf">medical community</a> has unclear guidelines and recent attention on rising costs could place pressure on the business.</p><p>There has to be a reason why this isn't a screaming buy at these prices and it ultimately rests on the Medicare cut risks. I'll spend part two describing this risk, the different ventilation devices, the recent MEDCAC panel on home ventilation, the recent office of the inspector general audit, and my current position. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[TableTrac (TBTC)]]></title><description><![CDATA[OTC Nano-Cap, highly illiquid, but a fantastic risk reward with 75% upside]]></description><link>https://adus.substack.com/p/tabletrac-tbtc</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://adus.substack.com/p/tabletrac-tbtc</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Adu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jun 2021 00:05:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F310305f0-32ae-47cb-a3a0-e22daafda0d7_585x498.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TLDR:</p><ul><li><p>30% founder/CEO ownership. </p></li><li><p>Reopening play also boosted by COVID</p></li><li><p>Sticky SaaS component to product with churn &lt; 5%. </p></li><li><p>Best in class product for their target customer</p></li><li><p>Ability to expand with a number of growth opportunities. </p></li></ul><h3><strong>Business: </strong></h3><p>TableTrac (TBTC) is a provider of <a href="https://www.euroasiacasino.com/understanding-the-basics-about-casino-management-systems-cms/">casino management software,</a> the focal point for day to day management of casino operations. A CMS can offer many solutions including player tracking for table/slot games, rewards/loyalty program interfaces, and back office IT/accounting solutions. TableTrac was started in 1995 by Chad Hoehne with a single patented solution for managing table games based on placing the player casino tracker on the dealer side. Since then, the company has implemented their solutions into more than 200 casinos domestically and internationally. However, they remain small with only 24 employees and a 10$ million market cap. </p><p><strong>Sources of Revenue and industry:</strong> system sales, maintenance fees, and other(includes financing operations and licensing business). TableTrac sells their system to casinos for an upfront fee and has an ongoing maintenance contract(a recurring source of revenue). The &#8216;other&#8217; line item contains any deferred revenues and licensing contracts (started in 2019 with a security company in Japan looking to create a secure CMS system). Their CMS system is allowed in 14 states and they are looking to expand with an application to get a license in California. Getting a license to operate a CMS in new states is difficult, thus TableTrac has a regulatory moat against any new entrants. In addition, casinos hate replacing their CMS system because of the downtime, thus churn is extremely low. They operate in a space where their system is necessary, but not an extravagant cost so switching costs are high. In fact, they have lost only 3 casinos in the past 2 years making churn ~2%. Of those three, one burned down and another switched to a larger competitor <em>who built a new wing for the casino. </em></p><p><strong>Competition: </strong>Their primary competitors are larger companies with casino management subsidiaries rather than pure play casino management software providers. The four competitors cited in their 10k are Aristocrat Leisure, Scientific Games, Konami, and IGT all offering CMS systems in addition the rest of their gaming business. Even though these companies are larger, TableTrac targets a niche segment of the market distinct from the huge Vegas casinos targeted by competition: Tribal Casinos and smaller casinos. TableTrac's offering is half the price of bigger competition for the same or even better services, thus making them suited for smaller casinos looking for a cost effective solution. While larger casinos can afford to pay up for CMS software and often have relationships with those larger game providers, smaller casinos need to manage their budget. In addition to the need for smaller casinos to choose a cheaper solution, larger casinos have relationships with the larger CMS providers via gaming contracts or other services. As with aforementioned example where a casino switches when a CMS provider built a new casino wing, the process of getting new CMS systems can be relationship driven rather than value driven for larger providers. If you&#8217;re a large Las Vegas casino and your kids go to the same school as the people at scientific games, quality and price aren&#8217;t much of a criteria for selecting a CMS system. Since the huge casinos likely won't choose TableTrac even if their offering is better for cheaper, they sell to a different segment of the market</p><p>There are ~1000 domestic target casinos for TableTrac (from the company, consistent with 500 tribal casinos and 500 commercial casinos in the USA), They have placed their system in only 220 locations so far. Their market also includes non casino locations that offer gambling and international casinos so the runway for growth is large. </p><p><strong>COVID impact: </strong>Though the pandemic took a toll on the gambling industry, TableTrac's business should come out stronger. The typical barrier to switching CMS systems is twofold: 1) the downtime of replacing a CMS and 2) The 'good enough' nature of many CMS systems. Many CMS systems are overpriced and serve only the barebone needs because casinos and gaming rooms typically mint money and have no need to constantly analyze cost-effectiveness. However, COVID shocked the industry to point where casinos too a hard look at their budgets&nbsp; Since TableTrac's offers comparable, if not better, services for half the price, the stress placed on casinos should catalyze growth for TableTrac. The downtime offered to casinos with lockdowns will also allow them to switch providers with limited friction. However, TableTrac didn&#8217;t lose a single casino during the pandemic demonstrating their resiliency. We can see evidence of the boost they received from COVID in their Q1 results<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a> where they added nearly 40 locations and have a record backlog. </p><p><strong>Inflection point in the model: </strong>while TableTrac isn't a SaaS business, the maintenance revenue is recurring in nature. They typically charge 10-15% of the initial system sale and the gross margins for these sales is ~90% and the unit economics are favorable because as they add casinos in a single location where one technician can service all of them. While maintenance revenue took a dip last year as TableTrac renegotiated some contracts so they didn't lose some customers, it should bounce back as people return to casinos. As pointed out by Avi at Long Cast Advisors(<a href="http://www.longcastadvisers.com/letters">3Q18 letter</a>), their maintenance revenue is hitting the point where it can cover operating expenses for the company which creates operating leverage. The system sales are just the gravy on top. </p><p><strong>Future Growth opportunities: </strong>although they have taken a conservative approach to growth so far, they have numerous levers for growth. Expansion into new states, larger casinos, and cross-selling/upselling ancillary products will all contribute to growth. They will continue to expand into new states and have opportunities on the east coast as well as an application pending for California. Although their target market is smaller casinos, they have started expanding into larger casino systems that recognize the value TableTrac provides. Upselling opportunities also exist both within the CMS system with upgrades and cross-selling for ancillary products such as security systems. TableTrac's singular focus on casino management gives them a product advantage evidenced by the accelerated development of <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/table-trac-inc-receives-positive-feedback-on-its-dynamic-auto-social-distance-products-used-in-recent-casino-reopenings-301069443.html">systems to help casinos comply with social distancing protocols. </a></p><p><strong>Why has growth been lumpy? </strong>Although the growth in revenue looks cyclical with some up years and some down years, the company has steadily added casinos each year. The cyclicality in growth stems from their financing program where deliver systems to casinos who then pay for it&nbsp; over time rather than all at once. The key metric to look at is growth in casinos/casino operators which has been steady.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc53396ce-5808-4fb8-bb52-a20654d3c9f1_2357x174.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc53396ce-5808-4fb8-bb52-a20654d3c9f1_2357x174.png" width="1456" height="107" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c53396ce-5808-4fb8-bb52-a20654d3c9f1_2357x174.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:107,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;2009 \nCasinos Operators at end \nGrowth Rate \nCasinos \nGrowth Rate \n12/31/2010 \n12/31/2011 \n12/31/2012 \n12/31/2013 \n12/31/2014 \n13% \n12/31/2015 \n12/31/2016 \n12/31/2017 \n12/31/2018 12/31/2019 12/31/2020 \n14% \n13% &quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="2009

They have a small employee base, and have prioritized responsible growth with consistent growth since inception with no need for outside capital since 2008. </p><h3><strong>Modeling the financials: </strong></h3><p>Whenever I create a model, it isn't complicated, but relies on a few key drivers of business performance. In TableTrac's case, I model the maintenance revenue as an amount per casino and the system sales as a function of the number of casino's added. Using their historical numbers, each system sale costs about 300k. The system is priced at ~1,500 per game thus a 300k system sale makes sense for a small 200 game casino. The maintenance is modeled as an amount per casino. Although the maintenance is said to be 1/10th of the system sales, the historical numbers don&#8217;t map this out perfectly and are a little bit lower in the 17-19k range per casino. Assuming a return to slightly lower than normal traffic, the maintenance can be put at the lower end of the range at 17k per casino. The model assumes no change in the size of casinos they sell to. For the full list of assumptions, see below.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F310305f0-32ae-47cb-a3a0-e22daafda0d7_585x498.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F310305f0-32ae-47cb-a3a0-e22daafda0d7_585x498.png" width="585" height="498" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/310305f0-32ae-47cb-a3a0-e22daafda0d7_585x498.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:498,&quot;width&quot;:585,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Assumptions \nCasino Growth Rate \nSystem Gross Margin \nMaintenance Gross Margin \nSystem Revenue per Implementation \nRevenue per system Sale \nMaintenance per casino Operator \nMaintenance per Casino \nOpex as % Of revenue \nDA as % Of Prev Sales \nTax Rate \nChurn \nOPEX retention \n12% \n65% \n90% \n17.0 \n60% \n25% &quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Assumptions

They have a great product and the sticky recurring revenues should keep them profitable in a normal operating environment. It only trades at around 12x EV/EBITDA based on 2019 numbers and the company should benefit in the aftermath of the pandemic. </p><p><strong>What about the drama at the company? </strong>Around 2010, <a href="https://www.startribune.com/a-bitter-boardroom-fight-spills-into-open/123425174/">some drama</a> occurred regarding an activist investor and management. The activist took a position on the board aiming to realize shareholder value by cutting some costs such as CEO pay and possibly taking the company private. However, a breakdown of trust led to the director and other being ousted by Hoehne. After this drama, one thing is clear: TableTrac is Chad Hoehne's company. Buying the stock means trusting him. It&#8217;s a positive sign that they don't constantly dilute shares and he owns a significant amount of the company. They even repurchased <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/table-trac-announces-third-quarter-2015-results-300178464.html">some shares in 2015</a> suggesting the company would take moves to realize the value of the stock if needed. </p><p>The stock is extremely illiquid so building a position without an active seller is difficult and is intended for individual investors. I hold a small position because I can't build a larger one :).&nbsp; To me, this is one of the best risk rewards out there.

However, slowing growth in the quarters (late 2019) before the pandemic was masked (no pun intended) by the acquisition of TeePublic. The slowing growth even led to the company ousting the CEO in February 2020 to appoint cofounder Martin Hosking as interim CEO. Before the company reported more results, COVID swept the world and turbocharged growth at the company. </p><p>Two sided marketplaces are typically great investments because of the network effects associated with the business but slowing growth at the core platform before the pandemic could be a sign of a staggering business. I have heard smart <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e4c4dc89e166529a9918439/t/5e4c7245422a5a57147aecc4/1582068294441/Bonsai+Partners+Q1+2019+Investor+Letter.pdf">bull</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/neke86_/status/1389092856783015936">bear theses </a>so I thought I would take a look at the business, especially considering the recent drop in the share price. </p><p>The ultimate question we're trying to answer: Has the Pandemic boosted Redbubble past escape velocity, or will it return to earth after a COVID-Induced Run? We likely won&#8217;t have a clear answer, but I&#8217;ll lay out what could go right and what could go wrong. </p><p><em>Side Note on Masks: </em></p><p>Before we get into the rest of the article, I thought I would add a note about mask sales. They represented 12 million in FY20 and ~9% of 1H21 marketplace revenue. Overall, these numbers aren't too large, but for any calculations I will use revenue ex masks. The mask story is immaterial if you&#8217;re bearish or bullish long term.</p><h3><strong>Industry and Competition</strong></h3><p>Redbubble's competition is from larger marketplace companies such as Etsy and Amazon with POD divisions, stand alone POD marketplaces (Zazzle, Society6), and POD platforms like Printify and Printful. Companies like Printify and Amazon can hold inventory and operate both the fulfillment and marketplace sides of the business. </p><p>Redbubble is larger than any other POD business in terms of GMV, thus offering a scale advantage when signing up artists, but the low friction to sign-up and upload designs leads to artists using many channels to sell their designs. Artists who want to maximize their potential revenue opportunities sell on multiple marketplaces, thus Redbubble is often beholden to the Google search results (explored in detail later). If artists have the same product on multiple sites, Google controls distribution because buyers are still platform agnostic. This effectively turns a potentially differentiated supply of artists and designs into a commoditized. Redbubble still isn&#8217;t the go-to site for all POD business. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"

1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Google is the intermediary</figcaption></figure></div><p>Redbubble's business is unique because of their focus on the artists. While other POD businesses may play the role of platform <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/shopify-and-the-power-of-platforms/">akin to Shopify</a> giving artists a &#8216;business in a box&#8217; to sell their designs, Redbubble plays the role of aggregator, bringing artists together to sell through the marketplace.</p><p>I would argue barriers to entry make starting a POD marketplace difficult but not impossible. Companies like Redbubble certainly have a scale advantage, but the capital light nature of the business means it lacks any physical capital moat. Redbubble&#8217;s moat lies solely in their scale and number of members since their fulfillment is outsourced. any capital investment for new entrants would be customer/artist acquisition.</p><p>Redbubble is the largest artist-buyer marketplace but they continue to compete with similar platforms though the pandemic likely increased the distance between them and their competition. By leading more artists and buyers to the platform, the flywheel continued to spin. Even if sales were juiced by COVID, they likely still managed to convert some customers to repeat customers. </p><p>For a point of anecdotal evidence, my introductory experience with Redbubble was last year and though I haven&#8217;t created an account, I have bought multiple times and plan to buy more. The idiosyncratic nature of some of their designs make purchases great gifts. A Redbubble membership doesn&#8217;t offer any benefits but I still search through Redbubble rather than Google for designs. </p><p><em>Side Note: Two intriguing public companies associated with the POD industry are Kornit Digital (KRNT) and Delta Apparel (DLA). Delta Apparel has a fast-growing subsidiary, DTC2Go, that serves as a fulfiller for print-on-demand platforms like Redbubble. DTC2Go owns the largest network of Digital printing devices in the world which is more sustainable printing method than traditional printing. DTC2Go basically holds the T-Shirts and prints designs on them. DLA could be an interesting value play as their high growth division is obscured by a larger, more cyclical, apparel business. Kornit Digital on the other hand, designs and sells these digital printers to companies like DTC2Go for printing purposes. Both are potentially intriguing stocks, especially DLA due to valuation. </em></p><h3><strong>Redbubble as a Marketplace</strong></h3><p>The primary bullish argument is that Redbubble is a two-sided marketplace with favorable dynamics and a strong brand, especially with artists. Andrew Rosenblum, in his 1Q19 letter, cites a 'maniacal focus on serving the artist community' as Redbubble&#8217;s competitive advantage. According to Rosenblum's experience with the company, they are hyper-focused on their artists and have always been that way. Redbubble's artist community is robust with the company giving users the ability to follow artists and <a href="https://blog.redbubble.com/2020/02/how-to-get-featured-on-redbubble/">rewarding artists that meet certain thresholds</a>. Martin Hosking, the founder and ex-CEO, certainly seemed hyper <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvcGxheWxpc3QvMjU5NmFhY2ItOGQ2YS00YjUzLWE3Y2MtYWJjMTAwNTIzM2E2LzQzMjE0ZjM4LTI4NWMtNGU2My05M2FhLWFiZjUwMDg4NjNkZC9iNThmMTE4Yy0xZTc5LTQyYmEtOTBhYS1hYmY1MDA4ODYzZjUvcG9kY2FzdC5yc3M/episode/N2MzM2UxNDYtOWUwMi00NDM4LWIwMDItYWMzNDAwM2IzMWQ2?sa=X&amp;ved=0CAQQkfYCahcKEwionKvUkc_wAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQCg&amp;hl=en">focused on the artist community.</a> In fact, the original issue at Redbubble wasn&#8217;t getting artists but rather finding demand as people often posted designs even without anyone to buy them! One example of their artist-centric approach is the refusal to offer paid advertising for artists because they believe it would lead to newer artists being turned away from the platform. Whether you agree with it or not, they obviously are conscious of any inequities it would introduce and weighed that against the possible revenue benefits.  &nbsp;</p><p>With this artist centered approach instead of the &#8216;business in a box&#8217; approach mentioned before, they are the go-to source for new artists but not for all creators. With the creator economy on the rise and influencers selling their merch online, they could be missing a massive opportunity as print-on-demand is a great option for creators to leverage their influence and sell items without holding large amounts of inventory. However, their focus on artists could also be an advantage in acquiring new artists and fostering a great brand. </p><p>From my anecdotal perspective as a buyer, I don't know the full strength of the artist community. The lack of loyalty from many artists certainly isn&#8217;t encouraging. Redbubble is certainly the first place many artists go for a side hustle/post their designs, but bigger artists selling their designs as more than just a side hustle have little reason not to use multiple platforms. </p><p>In addition, Redbubble is growing through new SKUs, which looks like chasing 'vanity growth&#8217; through GMV rather than maximizing happiness with their current base. By constantly introducing new products, Redbubble makes the supply on the platform the products offered rather than the artists. At its core, Redbubble's supply should their artists, not the products they offer. </p><p>This is an area of diligence I need help with. I know little about the Redbubble community thus I don't know how well the company treats artists. They seem to have the strongest community among newer artists but have had issues in the past regarding plagiarism and copyright violations from designs. </p><p>Let's look at the overall market in which Redbubble operates: Bill Gurley, in a 2012 blog post, lays out <a href="https://abovethecrowd.com/2012/11/13/all-markets-are-not-created-equal-10-factors-to-consider-when-evaluating-digital-marketplaces/">10 factors for marketplaces business</a>. Let&#8217;s look at Redbubble through this lens to see if the conditions exist for a successful 2 sided marketplace.</p><blockquote><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does it offer a new experience vs the Status Quo? <strong>Yes, </strong>Redbubble morphs the typically difficult business of selling art and enhances the experience for both artists and buyers.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does it offer Economic Advantages vs the Status Quo? <strong>Yes, </strong>Buyers have less friction to find designs and sellers have an additional source of income.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can technology add value? <strong>Maybe, </strong>Visual search for artwork is always tedious but Redbubble does allow people the ability to search through thousands more designs than in person. However, this may expose buyers to the paradox of choice where the number of options overwhelm them and leads to dissatisfaction. I wouldn&#8217;t say technology makes the art much better, but it makes the experience of buying it better. </p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; High supplier fragmentation? <strong>Yes, </strong>there are millions of artists who can join Redbubble.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friction of supplier signup: <strong>Friction is minimal, </strong>Now this can both a good and bad thing. If supplier signup is difficult, it can be difficult to aggregate suppliers, but low friction to signup allows competition to sprout. However, Gurley point out that 'aggregating demand is much harder and more critical' so ease of supplier signup isn&#8217;t a huge advantage. </p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the TAM large? <strong>Yes, </strong>Sizing up the TAM is difficult and while Redbubble puts it 280B, this includes the entire home apparel market. The likely TAM is smaller, but with only a 1B market Cap, Redbubble doesn&#8217;t have huge TAM concerns. </p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can they expand the TAM? <strong>Yes, </strong>the previous market for custom designed art is tiny compared to the possible market for Redbubble because they connect artists and buyers from across the world. By expanding access to custom designed art, Redbubble can take share from other sources competing for similar &#8216;jobs-to-be-done&#8217; like gifting and home d&#233;cor. &nbsp;</p><p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are purchases frequent? <strong>No, </strong>this is a major hit on Redbubble's business. The average # of orders per customer is only 1.1/year. The low purchase frequency creates issues around customer acquisition and the need to reacquire customers. </p><p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is Redbubble part of the payment flow? <strong>Yes. </strong>Redbubble is more than just a way for artists and buyers to connect, they are the intermediary through which the purchase is made. </p><p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp; Does it have network effects? <strong>Yes, </strong>the incremental customer experience is better than the previous customer experience. More buyers means more artist supply creating a better experience for everyone. </p><p>So far, Redbubble scores high with a score in the 8/10 range, but Gurley warns investors of the following: "finding a great opportunity is only a start, and this analysis could easily mislead one into underestimating the critical role that execution plays when it comes to marketplace businesses. Great marketplace execution is more nuanced and less systematic than other venture backed categories, and for every successful marketplace, you will find an amazing entrepreneur that out-executed the many others". </p></blockquote><p><strong>Even though the marketplace dynamics are there for Redbubble to succeed. There are still some potential execution issues with two major ones being repeat sales and their dependence on Google search. </strong></p><h3><strong>Repeat Sales </strong></h3><p>This is a key part of Redbubble's story: Can they drive repeat purchases? Over the last 4 years, the % of repeat purchases have remained relatively consistent at ~40%. Coincidentally, Etsy also has similar repeat buyer metrics with ~40% of buyers being repeat purchases.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1631038-f503-46f2-9519-65a75a1149df_1248x752.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1631038-f503-46f2-9519-65a75a1149df_1248x752.png" width="1248" height="752" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a1631038-f503-46f2-9519-65a75a1149df_1248x752.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:752,&quot;width&quot;:1248,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:206219,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1631038-f503-46f2-9519-65a75a1149df_1248x752.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1631038-f503-46f2-9519-65a75a1149df_1248x752.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1631038-f503-46f2-9519-65a75a1149df_1248x752.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1631038-f503-46f2-9519-65a75a1149df_1248x752.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Redbubble Repeat vs New purchases</figcaption></figure></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83371cc8-afa3-47ef-9d77-1f3bbfe6c2f3_960x711.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83371cc8-afa3-47ef-9d77-1f3bbfe6c2f3_960x711.png" width="960" height="711" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/83371cc8-afa3-47ef-9d77-1f3bbfe6c2f3_960x711.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:711,&quot;width&quot;:960,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:119814,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83371cc8-afa3-47ef-9d77-1f3bbfe6c2f3_960x711.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83371cc8-afa3-47ef-9d77-1f3bbfe6c2f3_960x711.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83371cc8-afa3-47ef-9d77-1f3bbfe6c2f3_960x711.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83371cc8-afa3-47ef-9d77-1f3bbfe6c2f3_960x711.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Etsy repeat buyers vs new buyers</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Note: the two graphs aren&#8217;t apples to apples because Etsy has repeat buyers wile Redbubble has repeat purchases. </em></p><p>Redbubble faces a couple issues with regards to repeat purchases. Purchases aren't made often (only 1.1 purchases per customer, FY2019 Report) and the average order value isn't large (hovers around 45$). While the artist community is strong at Redbubble and it holds a fairly high NPS in the mid 60s, driving higher retention and more buying among customers is key to keep the flywheel going. </p><p>Two metrics I defined for the company are the repeat purchase conversion rate (RPCR) and the repeat purchase rate (RPR). The RPCR is defined as the additional repeat purchases as a % of new purchases from the previous year (i.e. 35m additional repeat purchases from FY19 to FY20/153m new purchases in FY19). The RPR is the % of repeat purchases of total purchases from the previous year (139 repeat purchases in FY2020/(104+153) total purchases in 2019). </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F976be4a6-1fc3-4432-856f-8b1fd97372b0_1248x752.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F976be4a6-1fc3-4432-856f-8b1fd97372b0_1248x752.png" width="1248" height="752" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/976be4a6-1fc3-4432-856f-8b1fd97372b0_1248x752.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:752,&quot;width&quot;:1248,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:202424,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F976be4a6-1fc3-4432-856f-8b1fd97372b0_1248x752.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F976be4a6-1fc3-4432-856f-8b1fd97372b0_1248x752.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F976be4a6-1fc3-4432-856f-8b1fd97372b0_1248x752.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F976be4a6-1fc3-4432-856f-8b1fd97372b0_1248x752.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Overall, this shows that Redbubble loses quite a few customers after the initial purchase, converting only 20% of new purchases to repeat purchases (assuming 100% retention of older purchases).

Like Etsy, it likely has an increasing retention rate for each year a customer is with the platform (i.e., customers are less likely to churn the longer they are members). To me, the concerning part with Redbubble is the steadiness of their conversion rates. One would hope that these numbers get better over time as the marketplace grows and offers a better value proposition. One factor holding down their retention rates could be the low purchase frequency, so each customer has to be acquired through inorganic means multiple times. There is certainly room for improvement, but it requires execution. I am skeptical of how well new management can drive higher retention rates unless the products are simply bought more often. </p><h3><strong>Beholden to Google and Inorganic acquisition</strong></h3><p>The single biggest issue at Redbubble is their reliance on Google Search as a customer acquisition tool which has caused problems in the past. In late 2019, growth slowed to a crawl at the core Redbubble Platform (6%) and management attributed it primarily to inability to acquire customers through Google search. The slowing of growth doesn't show up in the financials because TeePublic grew 42% in the same period. This slowdown could have been just temporary, but the pandemic hit before we could figure that out.</p><p>One way to mitigate the Google burden is through Redbubble's App Ecosystem. Beyond just having more customers on the platform, app users are the real 'power users' of the platform. By bringing people into the app, it cuts out organic search and encourages customer loyalty. App usage data is encouraging and growing at &gt; 100%, albeit off of a small base. It represented ~12% of marketplace revenue in FY2020. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06a04768-0a8e-4d09-a988-d18eccf468d6_642x326.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06a04768-0a8e-4d09-a988-d18eccf468d6_642x326.png" width="642" height="326" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/06a04768-0a8e-4d09-a988-d18eccf468d6_642x326.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:326,&quot;width&quot;:642,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:143262,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06a04768-0a8e-4d09-a988-d18eccf468d6_642x326.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06a04768-0a8e-4d09-a988-d18eccf468d6_642x326.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06a04768-0a8e-4d09-a988-d18eccf468d6_642x326.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06a04768-0a8e-4d09-a988-d18eccf468d6_642x326.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Another way to reduce their dependence on Google&#8217;s algorithms is through other paid channels such as social media marketing though real organic growth will show up when users of the product start advertising of their own volition. Etsy&#8217;s growth trajectory was due in large part to people sharing the items they purchased from Etsy on social media. Redbubble sells Instagram-able products, so it should be able to leverage this organic growth channel. I am inept at using social media so someone else will have to share if Redbubble starts to be shared organically on Instagram. I certainly know laptop stickers are great conversation starters for in person interactions. </p><p><strong>Redbubble has another big issue:</strong> Visual search sucks. It sucks bad. To borrow an infamous phrase from the Justice Potter Stewart, "I know it when I see it", but I don't know how to search for a design. I can spend a lot of time searching via keywords for a product that might not exist. The worst part of this issue is that art is subjective. Redbubble tries to solve the impossible problem of <em>open visual search</em>. However, Redbubble's scale gives it some advantage: I don't know what I want, but I know Redbubble has the best chance of having it because it has the largest number of designs out there. Even though visual search sucks overall, if Redbubble can aggregate enough supply, it shouldn&#8217;t matter because it will be the go to place to search for designs. In addition, they can try and solve this problem by creating artist-buyer relationships as mentioned in the next section</p><h3><strong>Redbubble's Future Growth</strong></h3><p>I wanted to talk about future growth opportunities, but this section morphed into a mix of a wishlist as a user.</p><p><em>More Artist Focus: </em>There is room for further emphasis on the artist community with potential initiatives such as a list of trending designs and artists. In addition, a return to a social network like model (the original intention of the company) would offer buyers the ability to develop relationships with artists. I am much more likely to buy something from an artist who I know beyond their designs. Redbubble is slowly making the designs the supply of the platform, but plagiarism and the ubiquity of similar designs make this an increasingly homogenous supply. On the other hand, if they make artists the supply on the platform, the supply could be differentiated.&nbsp; By creating a buyer supplier relationship similar to a Youtuber, Instagram influencer, or podcaster, repeat sales are much more likely. The quality of designs do matter but a relationship with the artist drives returning customers/viewers. </p><p><em>Business in a box: </em>As mentioned before, many POD business have taken the '<a href="https://nbt.substack.com/p/shopify-and-the-key-decision-for">business in a box</a>' approach to gathering supply similar to Shopify, where they give people the tools to start, manage, and grow their business (Ex; Printiful). As described earlier, Redbubble takes a different approach, aiming to build a community solely on Redbubble. Redbubble is used as a side hustle rather than a full-time business. If artists want to monetize a following rather than start a following, they should choose a different POD provider. Redbubble is missing a large of the market, but if management chose to shift strategy to tap into this market, I would be worried. Redbubble isn&#8217;t meant to create a full-time business, it&#8217;s a place for people to connect and find their group.</p><p><em>Licensing: </em>This is where I see the largest opportunity. A substantial problem for Redbubble is monitoring designs for copyrighted content, specifically fanart. An artist can't post a design of a popular TV show without the approval of said TV show. However, Redbubble trying to open the fanart segment of the market by partnering with TV shows and movies. For a full list of their partners, check <a href="https://help.redbubble.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001021543?ref=partner-program">here</a><em>. </em></p><p>They don&#8217;t have any large brand partners such as Disney, Nintendo, etc, because larger companies can design and sell merchandise but there is an opportunity among fanaticism with smaller brands. Redbubble can effectively crowdsource designs for smaller brands with a fanatic following (i.e. Rick and Morty). No other print-on demand company is doing this well. </p><p>Progress is often slow because of the number of lawyers involved thus the concept is still being proven out, but the potential for growth here is high. There is a long tail of brands with a small enthusiastic group of fans, often designing fanart at home. Redbubble gives them the opportunity to express themselves and find people who love the same brands. </p><h3><strong>Valuation</strong></h3><p>There is uncertainty surrounding Redbubble's future, but the stock looks neither cheap nor expensive on a trailing Basis. It trades around a market cap of 1B AUD with gross profit in the last 9 months of $184m AUD. The TTM Gross profit after paid acquisition (exactly what it sounds like) is ~$150m AUD.</p><p>Management has set lofty goals of 1.25 Billion in Marketplace revenue with an EBITDA margin ~10% in the medium term. If the company can sustain the high growth rates to get there 20-40% and demonstrates operating leverage it doesn't look expensive for a growing marketplace business building up to escape velocity. However, the pandemic may have juiced growth and these long-term goals may just be cannon fodder for analysts on the call. </p><p>Modelling Redbubble's growth to me is futile due to the uncertainty surrounding the business. To me, this is a binary stock. Either it works and the stock has a &gt;20% IRR or it doesn&#8217;t and the stock stagnates/declines. If it does work, the company will accelerate growth through organic growth channels with favorable marketplace dynamics. If it doesn't, the same flywheel dynamics will push the stock lower amongst deteriorating financials. It isn&#8217;t priced for success and certainly not priced for failure. </p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>What's my conclusion? Don't hate me, but I don't know. I wrote this as a starting point for new investors and to get some discussion around the company. Management must capitalize on this short-term boost and maintain their focus on artists to continue to drive growth. I hold a small starter position(&lt;1%) and will add on signs of execution and vice versa. I would want to see Redbubble pursue some of the future growth opportunities I laid out above, lessen their dependence on paid acquisition/Google, and maintain steady growth rates in the &gt;20% range. In addition, I want to see people using Redbubble more often and Redbubble&#8217;s member growth continuing to grow. </p><p>They may have had a boost from COVID, but it could have been exactly what the company need to kickstart a phase of continued growth. I am taking a wait-and-see approach to the stock. If you believe the recent turmoil is akin to buying Chipotle after the E Coli scare, more power to you. Great brands are often great buys after massive drawdowns due to temporary concerns. Redbubble has a great brand but the acquisition of TeePublic was a horrid move and I don&#8217;t know how well the new management can execute.</p><p><em>Side-note on new management incentive</em>s: the stock incentives for the new CEO are based on a 10% total return from the date of the options. This seems to bode well for shareholders as the stock price was higher than it is now when he was appointed in November. </p><p><strong>I look forward to seeing if anyone has any opinions on the company or the stock.  I&#8217;ve laid out what I think are the relevant bull and bear thesis, does anyone feel strongly on either side?</strong></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What are the Chances?]]></title><description><![CDATA[How likely is it that you have chosen a winning stock?

'Growth at any price' isn't a common investing mindset as even nascent investors have heard of valuation and ****gasp**** profitability, but people are enamored with growth and often regard valuation as a red-headed stepchild. People are willing to pay up for supposed quality. In the throes of earnings season, a brief non-stock related post seems appropriate. This week, I wanted to look at how valuations can affect your returns through a lens of medical diagnostics (or if you&#8217;re fancy, Bayesian statistics) and how these can frame the chances of picking the 'next Amazon'. </p><p>It goes without saying that relatively high valuations (historically speaking) lead to <a href="https://mebfaber.com/2021/02/22/episode-289-mebisode/">underperformance of the market</a> in aggregate, but if one is an excellent analyst, is underperformance inevitable? When you can find the next great compounder, why should market underperformance matter? There are certainly great companies that will survive and thrive in all types of markets. True compounders can compound wealth over a generation regardless of market direction. </p><p>Investors aren't simply making levered bets on market direction when buying high growth companies: they are supposedly buying the next generation of Trillion $ businesses. Buyers of The Trade Desk believe it will play a role in the massive shift to connected TV. Shopify buyers are betting it will be the go-to E-Commerce company in a world moving online. Tesla is the <a href="https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-price-target/">future of electric vehicles, autonomous driving, car insurance, space and batteries</a>. As the canonical example goes, they are buying the next Amazon and, if discount rates are low, one can buy high growth at high valuations (though Amazon hasn't traded above 7x sales <a href="https://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2021/03/27/have-investors-lost-their-minds-with-growth-stocks/">since the tech bubble</a>). </p><p>If you had bought Amazon at the peak in 1999 at 100$ a share (&gt;40x Sales), you would still compounded your capital at &gt;17% over 21 years and would be sitting on a &gt;30x bagger. Not too shabby. Packy McCormick framed investor thinking well, coining the <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/dreams-all-the-way-up">price-FAAMG ratio</a>: with discount rates so low "you can abstract away a lot of complexity by thinking about startup valuations as the probability that they can grow as large as Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, or Google." When the end result is a trillion dollars, people are willing pay up. </p><p>I know some value investors immediately rolled at their eyes at that take, but he has a point. If CRISPR is going to change medicine, why wouldn't I pay up in form of a 25x P/Sales ratio? The issue with high valuations comes in two forms: 1) you must be extremely good at picking stocks due to a decreasing prevalence of stock winners at high valuations 2) high valuations reduce the likelihood of having a generational winner make up for a portfolio of duds. </p><h3><strong>A trip is Bayesian Statistics: Sensitivity, Specificity, PPV, NPV</strong></h3><p>Let us take a trip out of investing to look at a useful framework from the perspective of a medical diagnostic test using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. </p><p>Say we test everyone for COVID 19. The sensitivity is the amount of people with the disease who would test positive, thus a high sensitivity means few false negatives. In the same vein, the specificity is the number of people without the disease who test negative (high specificity means few false positives)</p><p>Now the positive predict value (PPV)/negative predictive value (NPV) are different. A PPV is the chance you have the disease if you receive a positive test and a NPV is the chance that you don't have the disease if you get a negative test. While the sensitivity and specificity are solely characteristics of the effectiveness of the test, the PPV/NPV are affected by prevalence of the disease. The equations relating the variables are on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_and_negative_predictive_values">Wikipedia pag</a>e with a nice explanation. </p><p>I tried to make the explanation as simple as possible but if you&#8217;re still iffy on the topic, there are some great videos and articles on the topic out there. </p><h3><strong>Back to Investing</strong></h3><p>With that quick tangent out of the way, let&#8217;s tie it to investing. The sensitivity and specificity are only functions of the stock picker. Assuming a 'positive stock' is good stock, a highly sensitive stock picker doesn&#8217;t miss many good stocks (reducing false negatives) while a highly specific stock picker doesn&#8217;t pick many stocks that lose (reducing false positives). The PPV in terms of investing are the chances that a stock pitch is actually successful. (i.e. I pitch a stock, the chances that the stock works is the PPV, akin to a &#8216;batting average&#8217;). </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc862270-aa5e-43ed-814e-1aa17fa44f23_525x349.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc862270-aa5e-43ed-814e-1aa17fa44f23_525x349.png" width="525" height="349" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cc862270-aa5e-43ed-814e-1aa17fa44f23_525x349.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:349,&quot;width&quot;:525,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc862270-aa5e-43ed-814e-1aa17fa44f23_525x349.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc862270-aa5e-43ed-814e-1aa17fa44f23_525x349.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc862270-aa5e-43ed-814e-1aa17fa44f23_525x349.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc862270-aa5e-43ed-814e-1aa17fa44f23_525x349.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">How we want Investing to look like: Equal numbers good (red) and bad (blue) stocks. </figcaption></figure></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9d4b151-8d7c-4054-8103-c6634323bc4f_624x345.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9d4b151-8d7c-4054-8103-c6634323bc4f_624x345.png" width="624" height="345" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b9d4b151-8d7c-4054-8103-c6634323bc4f_624x345.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:345,&quot;width&quot;:624,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9d4b151-8d7c-4054-8103-c6634323bc4f_624x345.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9d4b151-8d7c-4054-8103-c6634323bc4f_624x345.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9d4b151-8d7c-4054-8103-c6634323bc4f_624x345.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9d4b151-8d7c-4054-8103-c6634323bc4f_624x345.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">How investing is, 10 times as many bad as good stocks. </figcaption></figure></div><p>However, problems arise regarding the PPV/NPV when factoring in the prevalence of good stocks.

One can obviously discuss diversification to reduce susceptibility to company specific risk and reduce volatility, but from a purely stock picking perspective, swinging less and with more conviction leads to an increased rate of success both increasing specificity and PPV.

By choosing cheap stocks, these baskets are investing in a pool of stocks with a higher prevalence of positive returns over 3-5 years due to mean reversion. The same logic holds for us individual investors: fish in ponds where winners are prevalent. Whether its microcaps, international stocks, or unloved sectors, there are places out there where the rate of winners can be higher due to low valuations and minimal attention. By investing where the prevalence of good stocks is high, we do not need to be a great analyst!

Even if the rate of disruption is increasing introducing more generational winners, high valuations pare your returns. If one wants to be better at picking stocks, swing less and invest in areas where the odds favor you. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Use of the Price/Sales Ratio and an April Portfolio Update]]></title><description><![CDATA[A framework for thinking about the Price/Sales ratio.

Putting aside the powerful but simple idea that great stocks need both fundamental growth and multiple expansion, let's ask a different question: what does the P/Sales Ratio tell us? </p><p>For some, using a Price to Sales ratio to value a business is second hand with no further discussion of the company. For the more value oriented types, basing valuation on a price to sales is heresy. However, as with most debates, the answer lies somewhere in the middle, away from either side of the factional divide. </p><p>Just as analyzing revenue growth often strips a business's fundamentals bare, a price to sales ratio allows us to look at the forest rather than the trees. As with any valuation ratio, it gives us part of the picture. A P/Sales ratio abstracts any fiendish tactics used by accountants to boost net income, but it also removes any information about the margin structure of a business. </p><p>A price to sales ratio is certainly useful when comparing relative valuations between companies with similar margin structures, but relative underpricing doesn't equal absolute undervaluation. However, since FCF generation is the ultimate goal of any business, the key phrase in the last sentence is "similar margin structure" (in the sense of both Gross and Operating Margins). The investors at Chit Chat money attempted to adapt the P/Sales ratio with a metric called "Margin adjusted Price to sales" which equals P/Sales/GM. Instead of trying to correct the P/Sales ratio for margin structure or using a different metric which accounts for this, lets frame it a different way. </p><p>A price to sales ratio represents the market perception of margin structure. </p><p>Say a company is trading at 5x P/Sales; with a 20% FCF margin at maturity, such a company looks cheap. We can also use this framework in reverse to judge the possibility of multiple contraction. A price to Sales ratio of 30x is nearly always poised for contraction at terminal value because the margin structure and terminal multiple can rarely meet expectations (40% FCF margins and a 60x FCF multiple still only gets you to a 24x FCF multiple). Using this framework, we can reverse engineer the market's expectations for a terminal margin structure. </p><p>We can especially use this framework for companies about to demonstrate operating leverage. A company growing consistently at 10%, reasonably priced on a P/Sales ratio can be a great long term investment as they scale margins. One company that could fit this framework is Electromed (ELMD), it's a profitable business at priced at &lt;2x Sales but at 30x Earnings. It's consistently growing and could be on the verge of demonstrating operating leverage. </p><p><strong>Edwards Lifesciences as an Example:</strong></p><p>A company doesn't have to grow at extraordinary rates to win big if it can demonstrate margin expansion and resiliency. Take Edwards Lifesciences(EW): With an 11% Revenue CAGR, one would hardly expect the company to be a generational winner, but it returned an IRR of nearly 25% over 15 years due to multiple expansion and increasing profitability. From 2007 to 2021, the P/Sales ratio increased from ~3 to 20, but the P/E ratio increased from ~20 to 60, only a 3x increase. Why? Because margins increased from 10% to 20%. It's a top notch example of operating leverage and a strong business generating outsized returns after started cheaply priced on a price/sales ratio.   </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5505fb7c-281b-4b0a-8f66-a02a4ea8de65_2800x800.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5505fb7c-281b-4b0a-8f66-a02a4ea8de65_2800x800.png" width="1456" height="416" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5505fb7c-281b-4b0a-8f66-a02a4ea8de65_2800x800.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:416,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;80.oox \n60.oox \n40.oox \n20.oox \no.oox \nJan-Ol-2007 \nJan-Ol-2008 \nJan-Ol-2009 \nJan-Ol-2010 \nJan-Ol-2011 \nJan-Ol-2012 \nJan-Ol-2013 \nJan-Ol-2014 \nJan-Ol-2015 \nJan-Ol-2016 \nJan-Ol \n-2017 \nJan-Ol \n-2018 \nJan-Ol-2019 \nJan-Ol-2020 \nJan-Ol-2021 \n&#8212; Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) P/Diluted EPS Before Extra (Open: 29.52 High: 74.27 Low: 12.19 Close: \n&#8212; Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) - P/ Total Revenues (Open: 1.52 High: 25.48 Low: 1.45 Close: 25.48 Avg: 10.19) \n71.27 Avg: 36.18) &quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="80.oox

Margin expansion is of course capped at the max possible efficiency of a business (Altria isn't improving their FCF margins drastically anytime soon) while returns on invested capital can continue to be above the cost of capital (Looking at you Mr. Bezos). However, the rapid nature through which operating leverage presents itself and the more predictable nature of margins (compared to finding to the next Buffett or Bezos) lends itself as a tool for picking stocks at inflection points. </p><p>One need not look on a 10+ time horizon&nbsp; if a business is at an inflection point. Tobias Carlisle on a 2019 podcast with Ian Cassel framed inflection points as follows: "the sweet spot is two quarters to profitability". The same principle applies here; a company on the precipice of flexing operating leverage usually has a grossly undervalued stock on a 3-5 year time horizon. With a fairly short term time period, ROIC matters even less. If you can accurately predict swings in the margin structure, using a price to sales ratio is a great way to find undervalued companies. </p><p><strong>Putting it together</strong></p><p>Let's summarize the points made:</p><p>One framework to look at a P/Sales multiple is as a bet on the margin structure of a company and can be extended to a FCF multiple when looking at a business with predictable margins. In addition, businesses with a modest P/Sales about to demonstrate operating leverage can be a great hunting ground for stocks at inflection points. Since margin structure can be improved much faster than ROIC matters operating leverage shows up in the stock price quicker. Also, a company with mature margins must have an above average ROIC to drive returns. </p><p>Let me know if you have any other useful frameworks for thinking about a Price to Sales Multiple and how you use it to evaluate companies. </p><h1>April Portfolio Update</h1><p>Since it's the end of the month, I thought I would hop on the train of every fintwitter and post my positions and sizing.

I have yet to write about SMLR but I'll throw some brief thoughts in here. The valuation is fairly high and buying the stock at this point would be betting on growth into new product areas (at least from my model). With earnings on Monday, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised with a drop in the price due to the outstanding Q4 results and seasonality of the product. </p><p><strong>Overall portfolio thoughts: </strong></p><p>With a combination of luck and what I hope is skill, I've had some pretty good returns over the last year and have trimmed many of my top positions as the price appreciated. As a result, some of my top holdings are less concentrated and my cash position is higher than at other points in the last year. My selling philosophy is fairly simple. If I'm not a buyer after a 25% drawdown, I'm trimming. This lets my winners run but I can also sleep at night. </p><p><strong>New positions: </strong></p><p>This past week, I've added a new position: Redbubble ($RDBBY). I will write my thoughts on the company soon, but I believe it sits on the verge of operating leverage and the pandemic has accelerated their dominance. In addition, I am starting a position in Scientific Industries ($SCND),&nbsp; It's a very small company (25M market cap), thinly traded, and on the pink sheets so filling my limit order has been tough. I will write up my thoughts on this company soon too. </p><p><strong>Overall Strategy</strong></p><p>My strategy is an upside focused one as I am young and non risk averse. I hold positions which can fit into many buckets from microcap growth to midcap value. I tend to invest in smaller companies due to the lack of people smarter than me with more resources investing in these names. I also like to invest in healthcare companies as someone who's a bioengineer with experience and knowledge of both the science, clinical, and public policy of healthcare. Plus, I enjoy reading about medical device companies more than financials. </p><p>If anyone has thoughts&nbsp;about my portfolio or using the Price/Sales ratio, feel free to reach out at adu.subramanian@gmail.com.

I'll be breaking down a company popular on fintwit in fundamental terms. Immunoprecise Antibodies(IPA) is a favorite among the retail crowd and a writeup would be helpful to shed some light on the company. Here we'll break down Immunoprecise's business, the industry, the competition, the upside, and reasons for concern. Overall, I&#8217;m bearish because of a lack of clarity and concerning trends, but the company could certainly have upside. </p><h2><strong>Company History</strong></h2><p>Immunoprecise Antibodies was founded by Robert Beecroft in 1989 to develop antibody based diagnostics for diseases. Beecroft was a veteran of the biotech industry and built a profitable company doing ~200k in net income a year on ~2 million in revenue by 2015. In 2016, with a CEO switch, the company shifted to using the developed antibody discovery/screening technologies to focus on the larger, more crowded, therapeutic antibody market via drug discovery. They invested in new facilities, made an acquisition of <a href="https://www.immunoprecise.com/immunoprecise-acquire-u-protein-announces-4000000-financing/">U-Protein</a>, a contract research organization(CRO), and listed on the TSXV. In 2018, another CEO came in but the strategy stayed the same: sell antibody drug discovery services to pharma companies through a CRO model. They acquired another company, <a href="https://www.immunoprecise.com/immunoprecise-enters-into-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-modiquest-research-bv/">Modiquest</a>, in 2019 to support their operations as a CRO, and recently started an internal pipeline of therapies called Talem.</p><h2><strong>Company Overview</strong></h2><p>Immunoprecise Antibodies' primary business is a Contract Research Organization (CRO) whereupon pharma and biotech companies will contract Immunoprecise to develop therapeutic antibodies. The contracts are fee-for-service, thus IPA gets paid for each project. IPA is a full-service CRO meaning they will develop an antibody from discovery to manufacturing. Beyond the CRO, the company also has Talem therapeutics: a pipeline of early stage biotech assets developed based on their experience as a CRO. While some may liken Talem to a risky biotech, that isn&#8217;t the business model. Talem takes the knowledge they gain from helping big pharma with antibody discovery to develop new drugs which can then be licensed by big pharma. Talem doesn&#8217;t want to take drugs through clinical trials but rather wants to partner with larger companies to take them through clinical trials thus de-risking the business and reducing the investment capital needed from IPA.</p><h2><strong>Antibody therapeutics and discovery process.</strong></h2><p>To understand the discovery process, we must understand the biology of antibodies. Simply put, an antibody is the key to a disease&#8217;s lock. When a disease gets into our body, our immune system, specifically our B cells, recognize the disease through markers in/on the foreign cells (antigens). The B cell that generated the appropriate antibody which binds to the antigen then starts replicating and producing more antibodies. It also gets stored by the body for future use against the same antigen. Typically, each B cell produces a unique antibody which binds to a unique antigen.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9c727ed6-33ac-46ea-ab9c-e788e4414bf7_651x1000.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9c727ed6-33ac-46ea-ab9c-e788e4414bf7_651x1000.png" width="459" height="705.0691244239631" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9c727ed6-33ac-46ea-ab9c-e788e4414bf7_651x1000.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1000,&quot;width&quot;:651,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:459,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;T Cells and Cellular Immunity | Boundless Microbiology&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="T Cells and Cellular Immunity | Boundless Microbiology" title="T Cells and Cellular Immunity | Boundless Microbiology" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9c727ed6-33ac-46ea-ab9c-e788e4414bf7_651x1000.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9c727ed6-33ac-46ea-ab9c-e788e4414bf7_651x1000.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9c727ed6-33ac-46ea-ab9c-e788e4414bf7_651x1000.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9c727ed6-33ac-46ea-ab9c-e788e4414bf7_651x1000.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Therapeutic antibodies are needed when our body cannot produce the necessary antibodies for a disease. Antibodies can be used for antigens in foreign viruses, but they can also be used against internal receptors of diseases such as those on the surface of cancer cells. Therapeutic antibodies have a number of requirements to be effective: they must bind tightly to any antigen, neutralize the disease and not induce an immune response in a patient. As with any drug (or foreign substance) the body recognizes it as foreign and immediately starts attacking it. This is especially an issue when using animal antibodies.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb01974dc-a19e-4de4-90b8-08ca8d2029e2_685x485.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb01974dc-a19e-4de4-90b8-08ca8d2029e2_685x485.png" width="685" height="485" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b01974dc-a19e-4de4-90b8-08ca8d2029e2_685x485.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:485,&quot;width&quot;:685,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;A Mouse \nhybndoma \nImmunization \nwith \n(B) Phage display \nAb libraries \n(C) Transgenic mouse \nImmunization \nWith targets \nHarvest splenocytes, \nWierate hybridornas \n0 00 \n(D) Single B \nHuman \n00 \nSort B cells With \nlabeled antigens \nHarvest splenocytes, \ngenerate hybridomas \n0 00 \nScreening \nCOQ \nMouse mAb \nBiopanning \nwith targets \n(3-5 cycles) \nChimeric mAb \nHumanized mAb \nScreening \nConstruction of \nHuman IgG \nPCB, construct VH and VL \nHuman mAb &quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="A Mouse

Typically, the pharma company will find a target and bring it to the CRO to find antibodies when looking to outsource. The target must be validated in the disease process and antibodies must be found that bind tightly, are safe, and have the desired neutralizing function. One must balance high affinity and acceptance by the patient&#8217;s immune system. The two primary ways of finding matching antibodies are phage display and b cell selection. Phage display uses a library of already created human antibodies to match the target which reduces the risk of an immune response but requires workup processes to increase the affinity. B Cell selection processes use other subjects to generate matching antibodies which can then be humanized for use in patients (see the image and article above for a good overview of the process). For example, a mouse will be injected with the tumor cells, causing an immune response and the production of antibodies matching the disease target. We can then harvest the mice cells, sort them, and screen the B cells which produce the desired antibodies. While good phage display methods rely on the IP in the library of antibodies, good B cell antibody discovery methods rely on the ability to screen B cells and find the right antibodies to develop. There are numerous technologies directed at improving the speed, lowering the costs, and increasing efficiency in b cell screening technology. IPA's primary claim to fame is their "B cell select" platform which allows them to interrogate more b cells than the competition and find more candidates. The youtube video below explains this process well.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyoY-MbpnQ8">Plasma B-cells for Antibody Discovery and Cancer Therapeutics</a></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64aa1af1-ee55-413c-a2aa-352617d67e44_356x200.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64aa1af1-ee55-413c-a2aa-352617d67e44_356x200.png" width="356" height="200" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/64aa1af1-ee55-413c-a2aa-352617d67e44_356x200.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:200,&quot;width&quot;:356,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64aa1af1-ee55-413c-a2aa-352617d67e44_356x200.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64aa1af1-ee55-413c-a2aa-352617d67e44_356x200.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64aa1af1-ee55-413c-a2aa-352617d67e44_356x200.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64aa1af1-ee55-413c-a2aa-352617d67e44_356x200.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Great Youtube video on B Cells</figcaption></figure></div><h2><strong>Industry and Competition</strong></h2><p>Both the antibody discovery and CRO space are large and crowded markets. The market for antibody therapeutics is more than $100B each year (a simple google search will show you numerous sources) with IPA claiming more of this is being outsourced to CROs each year. While a CRO makes sense for a smaller biotech, larger pharma companies can have their own R&amp;D division which limits the possibilities for a CRO unless it holds a strong competitive advantage.</p><p>Among the competition for their discovery platform are Berkeley Lights which develops B cell screening tools for research organizations, Abcellera, which is another CRO dedicated to antibody discovery, and Charles River Laboratories, a large CRO servicing more than just the antibody therapeutics market. There are numerous private companies and oodles of capital flowing into the antibody discovery space because of the size of the market. With so much capital flowing into the market, I am reminded of Paul Enright on the recent Invest Like the Best.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fffabd5e6-62e4-4212-97b1-491424d33a4c_1152x1579.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fffabd5e6-62e4-4212-97b1-491424d33a4c_1152x1579.png" width="393" height="538.6692708333334" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ffabd5e6-62e4-4212-97b1-491424d33a4c_1152x1579.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1579,&quot;width&quot;:1152,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:393,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Patrick: \nWhat are the elements of when you see \nsomething that means great to you in a business? \nPaul: \nI think there are a couple of things.

This may be great for consumers, but shareholders could be left with the short end of the stick. However, Enright does point out the power of winning a protected position in a growing industry so IPA could still be a winner if they have the right competitive advantage.</p><p>So what are Immunoprecise's competitive advantages? From CEO interviews (of which there are a lot, more on this later) and company filings, three ideas are emphasized: their full service nature as a CRO, the ability to screen lots of B cells compared to other companies, and the ability to use collected data from sequenced antibodies to generate new drugs. </p><p><em>Full service CRO: </em>One edge the CRO business has vs other players is their full service nature. When a pharma company comes to them with a target selected, the pharma company need not worry about the project until it is ready for preclinical trials. Immunoprecise takes care of each step from target validation up to manufacturing. They tout this as a competitive advantage but they aren't unique in this aspect. Larger full service CROs certainly do exist and in their filings, they cite competition with <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1715925/000119312520247166/d20922dex9940.htm">"other full-service CROs." </a>&nbsp;While it is certainly an advantage against non full service companies, they aren&#8217;t unique in this aspect. In addition, larger CROs (of which there are quite a few) can certainly build out this offering easily.&nbsp;</p><p><em>High throughput, Multi-Animal B Cell Screening: </em>This is the bread and butter. Their ability to screen individual B cells faster than competition through proprietary technology is repeated as a competitive advantage. So what's their proprietary technology? <em><strong>No One knows</strong></em><strong>. </strong>Well, almost no one knows. Investor relations told me only 2 people know the details of their proprietary platform which is a trade secret (non-patented as to not reveal the secret). It's highly guarded and could really be a source of a competitive advantage, but I don't believe the hype. IPA cites the ability to screen up to 10 million cells, but this isn't unique to them.

Other companies with therapies/vaccines have taken some interviews, but usually waited until after the asset was developed and in trials because of the metric ton of work they needed to do. In a year where biotech is at the forefront of rescuing the world, time spent organizing and taking interviews for investors is bizarre.&nbsp; I prefer some communication from the companies I invest in, but the most successful ones often aren't promoting themselves monthly to investors. In addition, each interview is the same and adds little information. The CEO has <em><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IPA.V/insider-roster/">little ownership</a></em> in the company and has overpromised, which offers her little trust in my opinion</p></li><li><p><em>They had no R&amp;D expenses in the last quarter: </em>This is simple, but puzzles me. They are a CRO with a pipeline of preclinical assets in Talem, how can you have no R&amp;D for a quarter of a year? Even in a down quarter, do you not have salaried scientists? The lack of R&amp;D supports my theory that a lot of the process is outsourced.

Not only are these numbers chump change for any pharma company, declining revenue per client signals they either overcount clients to report "&gt;500 clients and 70% of top 20 pharma" or they spend heavily to acquire clients that don't pan out to full programs. One could say the pandemic year slowed rollout of pilot programs and conversion of customers to larger scale programs, but IPA still saw growth in the number of clients without seeing much in the way of revenue per client.&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p><em>Growth through acquisition: The ModiQuest      acquisition brought in ~$3.3 million in 2019 revenue with 800k in EBITA      and the U-Protein acquisition brought in&nbsp; ~$2 million of revenue      growing at 20%. These were both fueled by stock issuance and make up the      majority of the revenue growth in recent years. Such a strategy is      unsustainable considering they are barely profitable and the best      companies developing antibodies aren't available cheaply.</em></p></li></ol><h2><strong>Upside potential</strong></h2><p>So we've been through the business, the science behind antibody discovery, their competition, competitive advantages, the COVID assets, and reasons for concern/questions I have. Throughout the post, I have been bearish on the company and skeptical of it&#8217;s future prospects, but there is potential for the company to succeed. Details on the CRO antibody discovery platform are scarce, but they could have ground breaking technology behind their offerings.&nbsp; If that's the case, it should certainly be valued much higher. In addition, the increasing number of clients could represent engagement of more pharma partners who, after an initial pilot phase, will start programs with IPA. As they get more projects, they can leverage the additional data to generate effective therapies through Talem. Pharma companies would then license Talem's assets for development propelling IPA to the forefront of antibody development. In addition, the COVID asset could successfully pass clinical trials through a partnership with a larger company. Though I believe the company is overhyped at 10x EV/Sales for an unprofitable company, the upside skew for the company is large. If the story they tell is true, then it&#8217;s certainly undervalued.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee3bfdce-6e81-4490-a582-c535a1db0e7f_687x500.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee3bfdce-6e81-4490-a582-c535a1db0e7f_687x500.png" width="687" height="500" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ee3bfdce-6e81-4490-a582-c535a1db0e7f_687x500.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:500,&quot;width&quot;:687,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Lottery \ntickets \nUpside \nTail risk \ngnocom &quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Lottery

Starting in 2016, with a new CEO, the company listed on the TSXV and shifted to becoming a CRO through an acquisition. The shift continued in 2018 with another new CEO (the current one) as IPA continued to grow through acquisition in an attempt to penetrate the pharma market. The antibody discovery market is large and crowded with well funded competition constantly innovating. I am skeptical of the claims from the company regarding their competitive advantages and pipeline of therapies (including a COVID therapy) . Combining this skepticism with other reasons for concern colors me skeptical about the company. If you want to invest in the company, understand that you are trusting your money with the CEO and for me, the company&#8217;s promotional nature, overpromising, and low  insider ownership don't inspire confidence. However, as pointed out, the company could have a breakthrough technology which allows them to capture a large part of the antibody drug market propelling shares higher. </p><p>Disclosure: The opinions expressed in the Blog are for general informational purposes only and are not intended to provide specific advice or recommendations for any individual or on any specific security or investment product. &nbsp;It is only intended to provide education about the financial industry. &nbsp;The views reflected in the commentary are subject to change at any time without notice.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Intellicheck (IDN) - Bullish]]></title><description><![CDATA[High Growth SaaS?

Shoutout to @RS3688 and @JoseCapital for being great sources of info. </p><h1><strong>Business and thesis summary:</strong></h1><p>Intellicheck is a provider of identity authentication software to verify the authenticity of driver's licenses and verify a person's ID. Their three primary markets are for law enforcement agencies, underage fake IDs, and retail point-of-sale fraud. Their advantages stem from the ease of implementation and industry-leading fraud detection rates due to proprietary ID data. A business transformation started in 2018, with the introduction of Bryan Lewis as CEO and is reflected in the financial performance. Revenue growth was in excess of 70% before the pandemic closures and continued to exceed 40% during the pandemic while achieving GAAP profitability. At current levels, their forward looking opportunity isn't priced in as COVID has hampered results for their primary business: in person ID scans. Though lockdowns hampered the business, it offered a window into the resilience and innovative nature of the management team They quickly pivoted to their online, person-not-present offering to salvage revenue and add use cases in ecommerce especially. As people return to stores, Intellicheck is well poised to accelerate growth and with an asset light high incremental margin business, the profitability trends will trend in the right direction and FCF margins could reach 35%+ at scale.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd637ac0b-9d33-470f-9abe-da9425851911_417x266.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd637ac0b-9d33-470f-9abe-da9425851911_417x266.jpeg" width="417" height="266" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d637ac0b-9d33-470f-9abe-da9425851911_417x266.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:266,&quot;width&quot;:417,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;11 Movies ideas | superbad, movies, i movie&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="11 Movies ideas | superbad, movies, i movie" title="11 Movies ideas | superbad, movies, i movie" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd637ac0b-9d33-470f-9abe-da9425851911_417x266.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd637ac0b-9d33-470f-9abe-da9425851911_417x266.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd637ac0b-9d33-470f-9abe-da9425851911_417x266.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd637ac0b-9d33-470f-9abe-da9425851911_417x266.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Intellicheck would have caught this, robbing us of a great movie.</figcaption></figure></div><h2><strong>History and transformation</strong></h2><p>Intellicheck was originally founded in 1994 by a former firefighter to offer ID checking services to&nbsp; government agencies. They formed a relationship with the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA) and state DMVs that gave them the responsibility to check IDs against industry standards to ensure the formatting was done properly. This relationship gave them access to the ID format of the barcode on the back of the card (explanation in the next section).

This pricing structure also meshes with the mentality of banks/stores as the number of scans is what matters for the amount of fraud stopped. Bryan Lewis brings <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180207006073/en/Intellicheck-Announces-the-Appointment-of-Bryan-Lewis-as-President-and-Chief-Executive-Officer">experience</a> in growing a business to Intellicheck which improved implementation efforts and rebranding efforts to increase awareness.</p><h2><strong>The Barcode: Intellicheck's Advantage</strong></h2><p>The primary competitive advantage for Intellicheck stems from access to the DMV barcode format for all 50 US states, Canada and most of Mexico. For those who have a US driver's license, you can see this barcode on the back. The barcode on the back of an ID is a PDF 417 file and contains a lot of information. Anyone can read this information, thus giving them information such as the name and address, which can be matched to the front of the ID which catches fraud where the person doesn't have the right barcode data. However, Intellicheck is given the&nbsp; correct format of the back of the ID, thus giving them an advantage in the speed and accuracy of authentication. A card could have the matching information in the barcode, but the wrong format and Intellicheck would still catch them. Some companies can try and reverse engineer this formatting, but this takes resources and the DMV wants to keep this information as limited as possible. There are rumors from other companies that you can buy this data from AAMVA for a price, but AAMVA doesn&#8217;t cover all 50 states and any extra cost allows Intellicheck to capture more of the market with lower prices.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd1d1e8f-02c3-40a1-b7b4-d7df537982c6_650x500.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd1d1e8f-02c3-40a1-b7b4-d7df537982c6_650x500.jpeg" width="650" height="500" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bd1d1e8f-02c3-40a1-b7b4-d7df537982c6_650x500.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:500,&quot;width&quot;:650,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Intellicheck \nwith a \nliteral cheat code \nmgti;j com \nOther companies \nspending millions \non ID verification tech&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Intellicheck

This uses a process called Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and templating which uses digital watermarks, holograms, and other sources of data on the ID to verify it. The primary competitors here are Acuant, Mitek, and Jumio. Competitors are all better at front of the ID scans, but still have lower accuracy (60-85%) than Intellicheck (95%)<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a>. Even though Intellicheck has a higher overall effectiveness rate, scanning only the back of the ID has pitfalls. It verifies that the ID is government issued, but the wrong person may be scanning it. This makes Intellicheck leaps and bounds beyond competition for in-person, point of sale applications where a person verifies that the face matches. But Intellicheck may lag competitors&nbsp; for online applications because criminals may have a real ID issued, but not match the face on the card (synthetic ID). Criminals may also just create fake people to get issued real IDs, but this issue cannot be solved for in-person situations by anyone unless asking for lots of information.

Say you are checking out at Best Buy and forgot your Best Buy card. The cashier can scan your ID to ensure you are the person registered on the account and reduce the amount of fraud.</p><p>Regarding bank accounts, Intellicheck is more applicable to new account issuing as dual factor authentication is preferred for current account login. Another salient application are non-receipted returns where the store requires an ID to return an Item without a receipt. Intellicheck can also be used as a general use case for suspicious actors to prevent fraud.</p><p>One competitive advantage Intellicheck holds is that their solution requires no additional hardware and can be integrated into either a phone or the appropriate scanner. It is also a frictionless scan, placing no burden on the customer or cashier. It is usually a plug and play solution into current hardware, but some customers still hold old barcode scanners that need to be upgraded thus Intellicheck has a small amount of hardware sales. This contrasts with competitors in the retail space which require extra hardware for their templating based ID verification. Intellicheck is really the sole player for the in-person retail space. Even in use cases where hardware may be needed, Intellicheck usually sells hardware near cost and makes money off the scans.</p><p>The estimated TAM within the current customer base is ~$60-70M which includes 5/12 top card issuers and lenders in the USA. The TAM for all 12 institutions under the current use cases is $200-250M. As they penetrate other markets such as new lenders, e-commerce and healthcare fraud, their TAM will grow. The TAM for US ID verification services is in the billions.&nbsp; Ultimately, Intellicheck may not be the best solution for every ID verification task, but the market is large enough for multiple players, especially at current prices.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07bddbd0-a285-48f3-8287-5c3cc8550d7b_244x134.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07bddbd0-a285-48f3-8287-5c3cc8550d7b_244x134.png" width="414" height="227.36065573770492" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/07bddbd0-a285-48f3-8287-5c3cc8550d7b_244x134.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:134,&quot;width&quot;:244,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:414,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Dwight Theoffice GIF - Dwight Theoffice Identitytheft - Discover &amp; Share  GIFs&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Dwight Theoffice GIF - Dwight Theoffice Identitytheft - Discover &amp; Share  GIFs" title="Dwight Theoffice GIF - Dwight Theoffice Identitytheft - Discover &amp; Share  GIFs" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07bddbd0-a285-48f3-8287-5c3cc8550d7b_244x134.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07bddbd0-a285-48f3-8287-5c3cc8550d7b_244x134.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07bddbd0-a285-48f3-8287-5c3cc8550d7b_244x134.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07bddbd0-a285-48f3-8287-5c3cc8550d7b_244x134.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h2><strong>Unit Economics</strong></h2><p>Even though Intellicheck just turned GAAP profitable, the operating margins at scale should be much higher. Contracts signed by banks are typically 3 years long and sticky. In addition, each additional scan comes at little to no cost for Intellicheck. Estimates from the company put the incremental EBIT margin on a scan at 70%. Since Intellicheck's competitive advantage is based on access to DMV data, the costs of running the business are extremely low. For future growth, research and development is needed to build out their non barcode based offering through licensing other companies or internal development. In addition, increased sales expenses are expected for growth into current and new markets.</p><p>When Intellicheck is fully integrated into their customer base, the FCF margin can be 40%+ (85% Gross margin, 30% R and D margin, 10% SG and A margin). For many growth stage companies, the unit economics are hard to flesh out thus FCF margins at scale are over estimated, but Intellicheck's business model lends itself to great operating leverage. In addition, at current price-per-scan levels, Intellicheck also has potential to grow by flexing its pricing power.</p><p>In the industry, Intellicheck has the lowest per scan cost with estimates in the $0.2-0.3 range. Competitors typically price ~$1 for an often inferior product, suggesting Intellicheck has some pricing power. As older contracts expire, Intellicheck can renegotiate for higher prices per scan while offering a value add at a lesser price than competitors. However, I am wary of assuming too much pricing power as competitors have attributed Intellicheck's growth to their low cost and a primary reason for possibly switching cited by Intellicheck customers is a steep increase in pricing.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56b2a6cb-1083-4d00-9f1f-be90e4ef0709_687x500.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56b2a6cb-1083-4d00-9f1f-be90e4ef0709_687x500.jpeg" width="687" height="500" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/56b2a6cb-1083-4d00-9f1f-be90e4ef0709_687x500.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:500,&quot;width&quot;:687,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Unprofitable \nInvesting \nfor Growth \ngnocom&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Unprofitable

In addition, Intellicheck's solutions were still in the pilot phase for most banks in the last couple of years. With good results, the pace of adoption will increase. Their customers are recommending the products to other potential customers citing it as the best possible fraud solution. Awareness has always been an issue as many competitors had never heard of Intellicheck, thus this word-of-mouth marketing is encouraging. With more awareness, the sales cycle will shorten and adoption will accelerate. We are in the beginning phase of the S curve for Intellicheck with 10-15% penetration among the current customer base. Big banks can be bureaucratic when adopting new solutions, but Intellicheck will eventually be a needed solution due to the externalities of preventing fraud. Think about this: if you're a criminal and know you're gonna get caught at store X, you go to store Y instead, which means store Y now needs prevention measures creating a 'flywheel effect'. There is evidence of the Intellicheck's implementation capabilities are being taxed to the max as new customers to onboard join the queue immediately as others are onboarded.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd94b1ca2-64e2-4d74-8a52-29beb2c24714_1139x159.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd94b1ca2-64e2-4d74-8a52-29beb2c24714_1139x159.png" width="1139" height="159" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d94b1ca2-64e2-4d74-8a52-29beb2c24714_1139x159.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:159,&quot;width&quot;:1139,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Bryan Lewis \nI'd Say that our irnplementation pipeline continues to remain relatively static because as soon for as many as \nWe bring live, got that many new that Come on so it'S been Bill does a great job Of and \nhis team Of ettin \neople running in 2nd Out the door, and the sales teams and Our clients doing an equally \ngood job of \nin new things into the beginning of the funnel of the So I'm very happy with how \nwe look in terms of the prospects to bnng live going forward.&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Bryan Lewis

If the DMVs decide to stop working with Intellicheck for new IDs, Intellicheck could lose access to the proprietary data that lends them a competitive advantage. This is the worst case scenario but extremely unlikely. First, the DMV has worked with Intellicheck for 2+ decades and governments are extremely slow to move, thus they are unlikely to switch if Intellicheck continues to serve their purposes. In addition, changing vendors would require vetting of the new company which takes time and money. More likely, but still improbable are one or two DMVs switching vendors or building in house solutions. Intellicheck relies on having national coverage, thus even one or two states switching could hurt their ID verification abilities.</p><p><em>Risk 2: Leakage of Barcode formats. </em>In some states, namely Connecticut and Kansas, the barcode formatting were leaked, allowing criminals to make fake IDs with legit barcodes. This reduces Intellicheck's effectiveness to below that of competitors for those IDs (since their OCR tech isn't built out&#8230;yet) and brings overall efficacy down to 95% from oft-touted 99%. If this occurs in more states and continues to reduce their effectiveness, their growth will slow and customers may choose not to renew their contracts (those IDs will stay in circulation for 8-12 years before requiring renewal). Although this risk is legitimate and can reduce effectiveness, any leaks of the barcode makes the DMV more protective of the barcode format, which reinforces Intellicheck's competitive advantage. In addition, Intellicheck is building out their OCR and biometric tech to improve efficacy even in the absence of the barcode formatting.</p><p><em>Risks 3: Other companies reverse engineer the barcode format. </em>This risk does exist, but is largely mitigated by the costs required to reverse engineer the formatting every time a new format comes out. Intellicheck has a clear pricing advantage even if others can reverse engineer the barcode since they receive the format for free.</p><p><em>Risk 4: Switch to different ID formats. </em>One oft-quoted possibility for DMVs is a switch to a different barcode format or to a digital ID verification method. However, even if the DMV switches formats, Intellicheck can leverage its relationship for continuing access to the barcode format. In fact, when Delaware rolled out their recent Mobile ID feature with QR codes, Intellicheck was a part of the pilot (according to a former employee).</p><p><em>Risk 5: Rise in two factor authentication. </em>While two factor authentication is often used for people with current accounts as an easier ID verification method, dual factor authentication doesn't work for new account signups or even for older people who lack tech savviness.</p><p><em>Risk 6: Continuation of Covid effects. </em>Decreased scan volumes and long sales cycles were the primary effects of the pandemic but large COVID risks are in the rearview mirror. As retail volumes <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/us-economy-march-retail-sales-coronavirus-recovery-11618450223?mod=article_inline">return</a> with increased vaccinations, these risks are largely mitigated. Some may argue that normalized 2021 spending will mark a return to services rather than goods (where Intellicheck dominates) but this is a temporary blip and doesn't affect the long term trajectory. Some may be concerned by a slowdown of growth in Q4 this year with SaaS growth of only 20% but this can be attributed to two things: increased lockdowns and a slow selling season due to the holidays. Even though Q4 typically dominates the revenue for the year (33% of scans in non-COVID years), the reduced scan volumes made YoY growth numbers look slow even though implementations for the year and the pipeline continued to indicate future growth is on the way.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Risk 7: Scale issues. </em>Intellicheck may have some issues scaling their sales team with new members joining the staff in the last year. Intellicheck&#8217;s sales spend will increase and issues could happen if their growth spend is overly ambitious and they overspend for their growth. We will likely need a year to see if the new hires on the executive team and the sales side were effective. I believe in the company&#8217;s ability to scale because the product is better, cheaper, and easy to implement(according to the customer). With cash on hand, they also have the leeway to overspend for growth. I would rather they overshoot than undershoot because the product is that good.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Modeling the Financials</strong></h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3625c304-ebeb-4f96-95ea-7f3dcabfef01_687x500.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3625c304-ebeb-4f96-95ea-7f3dcabfef01_687x500.jpeg" width="687" height="500" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3625c304-ebeb-4f96-95ea-7f3dcabfef01_687x500.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:500,&quot;width&quot;:687,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Guesses \nAssumptions \ng'ip.com&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Guesses

We know the following about Intellicheck: they have a best in class solution for the in person retail space ($200-250 mil TAM) with a $60-70 mil TAM among current customers. They are expanding to other verticals and have a person-not-present offering which is seeing increasing adoption. The total addressable market is in the billions for ID verification. Their model has extreme operating leverage with little fixed costs and the possibility for pricing increases to match competitors.</p><p>All of the following scenarios use an 11% discount rate.</p><p><strong>Base Case:</strong> Assumptions: 40% revenue CAGR through 2025, increasing FCF margins from 15% to 30% in 2025 and a multiple of 20x FCF in 2025. At 57 million in 2025 revenue, this assumes they penetrate their current customers' TAM, but do not sell to additional customers or expand into other markets.

They have committed to organic growth over the coming years and should grow at the pace of the plastics industry which is ~3% a year. Some may worry about the plastic industry as a whole and the possibility of resin price inflation cutting margins, but both worries are overblown (discussed later). Even though the BERY team has a stable, cash-generating, business, it is materially underpriced compared to other companies in the packaging space. This underpricing is where the activist, Canyon Partners, comes in.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a01c90b-7b18-4d0f-a01f-a2b08c69c4b0_576x433.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a01c90b-7b18-4d0f-a01f-a2b08c69c4b0_576x433.png" width="576" height="433" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8a01c90b-7b18-4d0f-a01f-a2b08c69c4b0_576x433.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:433,&quot;width&quot;:576,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a01c90b-7b18-4d0f-a01f-a2b08c69c4b0_576x433.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a01c90b-7b18-4d0f-a01f-a2b08c69c4b0_576x433.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a01c90b-7b18-4d0f-a01f-a2b08c69c4b0_576x433.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a01c90b-7b18-4d0f-a01f-a2b08c69c4b0_576x433.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><strong>Canyon Partners' activist letter</strong></p><p>In February of 2020, before the world fell apart because of one spiky boi, Canyon Capital Advisor wrote an activist letter to BERY management to do three things: hire someone to help deleverage, deleverage to the point where BERY becomes investment grade (ceasing M&amp;A in the process) and correcting market misperceptions about ESG concerns. If you haven't noticed, they want to deleverage the company. Canyon compares BERY to its closest Competitor Amcor which the market offers premium valuations due to a better capital structure (&lt; 4x Net Debt to Ebitda). Other plastic packaging companies also trade at a premium.&nbsp; Even at 4x Net Debt/EBITDA, Altium packaging, a comparable plastics manufacturer was assigned a 10x<a href="https://loews.com/FileStore/Altium-Lenders-Presentation.pdf"> EBITDA</a> Multiple when acquired. BERY currently trades at ~8x EBITDA. In addition to pointing out the relative undervaluation and horrid capital structure, Canyon also makes evident the importance of the right messaging on plastic production, recycling, and sustainability concerns. BERY is taking steps to reach sustainability goals as mentioned before and in reality, plastics are useful and likely not going anywhere. Management should make these points abundantly clear so people aren't turned off by the thought of investing in an unsustainable, non-ESG plastics company.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F766b5d03-0c61-4b1b-9d00-57648aac4f96_687x500.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F766b5d03-0c61-4b1b-9d00-57648aac4f96_687x500.png" width="687" height="500" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/766b5d03-0c61-4b1b-9d00-57648aac4f96_687x500.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:500,&quot;width&quot;:687,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F766b5d03-0c61-4b1b-9d00-57648aac4f96_687x500.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F766b5d03-0c61-4b1b-9d00-57648aac4f96_687x500.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F766b5d03-0c61-4b1b-9d00-57648aac4f96_687x500.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F766b5d03-0c61-4b1b-9d00-57648aac4f96_687x500.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><strong>Worries over Plastic</strong></p><p>The biggest concern people often have is with the plastic industry as a whole.

The holders of BERY are primarily institutions with the public owning less than 1% of the shares outstanding. Ultimately this stock will move with institutional buying: stock market promoters aren't going to promote a highly levered packaging producer for retail buying. However, a notable thing about BERY are possible catalysts for more ownership on the horizon: reframing ESG and reducing leverage. On the first point, if BERY is able to effectively rebrand, previously ESG focused strategies could start buying the stock. The latter point is more salient as many funds won't buy a company at &gt; 4x Net debt to EBITDA. If BERY can hit their leverage goals, more money should be on the way. Ultimately, BERY stock will likely have more buyers than sellers in the coming year.

However, as discussed before, these risks are unlikely to manifest. In addition, any inflation in resin prices are passed through so margins remain consistent. Their news release page is a slew of releases about reducing the high cost debt and either refinancing it or reducing it. At an expected 1B FCF in 2021, it trades at &gt; 10% FCF, which is unreasonably high for a company that is stable and growing at ~rate of population growth.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>BERY may not be a sexy growth stock lighting the world on fire, but it has something many fintwit favorites don't: a metric ton of cash generation. Combining that with an activist campaign looking to unlock value, and catalysts for more flows into the stock, and a material mispricing, makes me bullish. It trades near the bottom of comparable company acquisition EBITDA multiples and public company valuations, thus providing a floor for the stock price and great risk-reward.</p><div class="footnote" id="footnote-1"><a href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>FCF yield is = Free cash flow/Market Cap</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Some Links, Thoughts, and memes]]></title><description><![CDATA[The week in review: notable things I read and Listened to with some commentary and memes]]></description><link>https://adus.substack.com/p/some-links-thoughts-and-memes</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://adus.substack.com/p/some-links-thoughts-and-memes</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Adu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 12 Apr 2021 01:41:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F391f679c-7653-4248-a577-16833760ae6a_706x604.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Articles</h1><p><em>How to solve problems: </em>We tend to <a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/when-it-comes-problem-solving-new-uva-study-finds-less-more">add things</a> to solve problems. So maybe the next steps aren't to ask what stocks are the best ones to buy but rather which companies have you bought that may be good to sell. This issue is less problematic in investing because a limited amount of cash forces us to make decisions in tandem (need to sell to buy), but most of people's time is spent looking at new companies. Maybe my returns could be better if I spent more time analyzing the companies I have already bought to ensure the stocks are still worth it. </p><p><em>Pharmacies and the Drug Industry: </em>Great <a href="https://theprescription.substack.com/p/a-drugs-convoluted-journey-from-factory?r=24v6n&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=twitter">rundown</a> of a drugs journey and description of the value chain.

For example, musicians produce the same amount of music as they did in 1900 but now cost more because comparable jobs have higher wages. This issue often arises in careers focused on person-hours where the service rendered is essential (notably education and healthcare).&nbsp; In healthcare, a worker is often needed to talk with the patient and implement routine tasks. In addition, doctors spend <a href="https://www.jwatch.org/fw111995/2016/09/06/half-physician-time-spent-ehrs-and-paperwork">half their time</a> on paperwork. We can really drive down costs by automating these tasks. We need to essentially turn more of medicine into a goods like process where each result is reproducible and rote tasks are automated. </p><p><em>A drop in approval rates for drug applicatons:</em> A new, more <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-fda-is-clamping-down-expect-choppy-waters-for-biotech-stocks-51616756406">restrictive FDA</a> could spell trouble for biotech stocks looking for approval.

Aa someone fishing in the pond where the market cap is usually not 2B, this isn't terrible news.

Two parts stick out to me: 1) his background isn't the typical by the bootstraps story, he was privileged and knows it. His family did run into financial troubles, but he had a pretty nice upbringing and admitted it, which is different than the typical story. As someone from an upper middle-class family, I appreciated the honesty. 2) He dropped some great wisdom on the uselessness of detailed DCFs and models. He keeps everything simple and runs 3 sanity check models: a reverse DCF (using a simple template), the FCF yield, and a comparable company analysis (using acquired companies as the basis). As someone who values qualitative insights first and putting numbers to it second, this approach makes sense. Make sure the business makes sense and then model it out. Don't start with a DCF. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79f482cc-f633-4b64-9385-5edfc4f5a80c_757x549.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79f482cc-f633-4b64-9385-5edfc4f5a80c_757x549.jpeg" width="757" height="549" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/79f482cc-f633-4b64-9385-5edfc4f5a80c_757x549.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:549,&quot;width&quot;:757,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Excel \nformulas \nDiscounted \ncash flow analysis &quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Excel

A lot of it is overly optimistic and he even praised Theranos in the first version of the book, but there are some nuggets of wisdom to frame your thinking if you&#8217;re interested in innovation in healthcare. It still holds it own even from 2014 because of the salience when it comes to discussing patient owned data to make healthcare processes seamless. </p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
