The vehicle is comprised of three Falcon 9 first stages oriented side-by-side. This means that the vehicle is capable of placing approximately four times as much payload mass as a Falcon 9 into low Earth orbit. While much of the commercial satellite market has trended towards smaller satellites that don&#8217;t require such a high lift capability, Falcon Heavy is best positioned to service the market for large, high-value national security and science missions that must be placed in higher orbits or even delivered to other planets.</p><p>However, the demand for such missions dipped in recent years. As a result, the Falcon Heavy has only flown three times since its introduction in 2018, with the most recent launch taking place in 2019. However, the rocket is scheduled for five flights just in 2022 and another five through 2024, so it is likely to have a busy few years ahead.</p><p>The Falcon Heavy&#8217;s first test flight in 2018 famously launched a cherry red Tesla roadster into an orbit around the Sun that occasionally passes by Mars.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a8d10c1-dcc6-492b-8259-6e95ba8cf247_580x324.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a8d10c1-dcc6-492b-8259-6e95ba8cf247_580x324.jpeg" width="560" height="312.82758620689657" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4a8d10c1-dcc6-492b-8259-6e95ba8cf247_580x324.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:324,&quot;width&quot;:580,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:560,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Where is Starman?

Originally forecast in 2011 to fly in 2017 at a development cost of $10B, SLS has so far cost closer to $21B to develop and may not conduct its first flight until 2023.</p><p>While missed budgets and timelines are not inherently unexpected in the development of a novel launch vehicle, it is the nature of SLS&#8217;s technical development that makes the setbacks particularly frustrating in the space community. Many of SLS&#8217;s systems were chosen specifically because of their extensive flight heritage which would theoretically enable a simpler and faster development process. For example, the four RS-25 engines that will power SLS&#8217;s first stage are based on the same Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME) that flew for decades. In addition, SLS&#8217;s upper stage uses the RL-10 engine which was first flown as far back as the 1960s. As a result, for all of the cost overruns and delays that have plagued SLS&#8217;s development, NASA has gained relatively little in the form of maturing novel technologies.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F588e81e5-0ab6-45ec-8534-80f518971943_1432x1123.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F588e81e5-0ab6-45ec-8534-80f518971943_1432x1123.png" width="1432" height="1123" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/588e81e5-0ab6-45ec-8534-80f518971943_1432x1123.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1123,&quot;width&quot;:1432,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:40451,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F588e81e5-0ab6-45ec-8534-80f518971943_1432x1123.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F588e81e5-0ab6-45ec-8534-80f518971943_1432x1123.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F588e81e5-0ab6-45ec-8534-80f518971943_1432x1123.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F588e81e5-0ab6-45ec-8534-80f518971943_1432x1123.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Comparison of the lift capabilities of super heavy-lift class launch vehicles.</figcaption></figure></div><h3>Starship</h3><p><strong>Organization: </strong>SpaceX</p><p><strong>Payload Mass Capacity to LEO</strong>: 100,000kg</p><p><strong>Price per launch</strong>: $TBD</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F938484bb-ed89-4155-ac48-8af0ddd78849_800x534.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F938484bb-ed89-4155-ac48-8af0ddd78849_800x534.jpeg" width="520" height="347.1" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/938484bb-ed89-4155-ac48-8af0ddd78849_800x534.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:534,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:520,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Photo of SpaceX launch and catch tower.&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Photo of SpaceX launch and catch tower." title="Photo of SpaceX launch and catch tower." srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F938484bb-ed89-4155-ac48-8af0ddd78849_800x534.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F938484bb-ed89-4155-ac48-8af0ddd78849_800x534.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F938484bb-ed89-4155-ac48-8af0ddd78849_800x534.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F938484bb-ed89-4155-ac48-8af0ddd78849_800x534.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">SpaceX&#8217;s Starship launch vehicle. Source: Ars Technica</figcaption></figure></div><p>Depending on who you ask, SpaceX&#8217;s Starship rocket is either a vastly overpowered vehicle with little customer demand, or it is a rocket that will fundamentally transform the entire space industry through how it reduces access costs to space. What Starship <em>will</em> be when it first launches, is the most powerful rocket to ever fly. It weighs over 1,200 tons at liftoff and will be capable of putting over 100 tons of payload into orbit on a single launch. Beyond its size, what makes Starship so revolutionary is its ambition for full reusability of its first and second stages. Prior to SpaceX&#8217;s currently flying Falcon 9 rocket, no launch vehicle had ever reused the first stage of its rocket. In fact, the idea of landing a rocket stage and reusing it was largely considered impossible prior to SpaceX. Starship seeks to accomplish a much greater challenge, landing and reusing the entirety of the vehicle, both the first and second stages.</p><p>In doing so, SpaceX hopes to greatly reduce the cost of launch access by eliminating the need for discarding any significant part of the rocket during launch. Without any lost hardware, SpaceX hopes to have its launch costs approach only the cost of the propellants used.</p><p>SpaceX also intends for Starship to be the rocket that first lands humans on Mars and makes humanity multi-planetary. Here&#8217;s a recently released animation of how Starship will make that possible.</p><div id="youtube2--Oox2w5sMcA" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;-Oox2w5sMcA&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-Oox2w5sMcA?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><h3></h3><h2><strong>A Rebirth of Extraterrestrial Travel</strong></h2><p>Since the end of the Apollo program in the early 1970s, the world has not endeavored to put humans on another planetary body. In fact, since the Apollo program, the US has not had a human-rated transportation system capable of reaching the moon or other planets. The Space Shuttle, which flew from 1981 to 2011, was built to reach Earth orbit but never beyond. With the introduction of SLS and Starship, two vehicles developed specifically with interplanetary human space travel in mind, we are returning to a period of history where we will hopefully see humans on the Moon again and potentially even Mars for the first time.</p><h2>The End of an Era</h2><p>SLS and Starship, the two super heavy-lift vehicles that will both attempt to launch for the first time this year, embody a transition that is nearly complete in the space industry. That is the transition away from government-developed launch vehicles and towards rockets designed and built by commercial entities.</p><p>The cost and execution challenges of government rockets is quickly becoming unpalatable in the current space era. This was best illustrated in a recent House Science Committee hearing involving the NASA Inspector General, who serves as an independent watchdog for the agency. In the hearing, the Inspector General reported that a single SLS rocket will likely cost about $2.2B per launch. He further described the figure as &#8220;a price tag that strikes us as unsustainable.&#8221;</p><p>In contrast, SpaceX&#8217;s Starship rocket was developed primarily at the cost of SpaceX rather than the US taxpayer. Further, SpaceX aims to bring each Starship flight cost closer to $10M per launch, once the vehicle has been flying for two to three years. It is an ambitious figure, and the cost will likely start at much higher, but it illustrates the orders of magnitude difference between the costs of government and commercially developed rocket programs.</p><p>Furthermore, the Inspector General offered a scathing account of the relationship between NASA and the contractors that the organization utilized to bring SLS to life. &#8220;We did see very poor contractor performance on Boeing&#8217;s part &#8212; poor planning and poor execution&#8230;We saw that the cost-plus contracts that NASA had been using to develop that combined SLS and Orion system work to the contractors rather than NASA&#8217;s advantage.&#8221;</p><p>As a result, it is likely that SLS is the last of its kind. In recent decades rocket launch has become a form of critical transportation infrastructure, which is best suited for the private sector that can optimize for cost efficiencies and scalability. NASA pioneered rocketry in the United States and has successfully passed much of that knowledge base to private industry.</p><p>Consequently, most agree this is a key step that will benefit both NASA and the commercial space industry. Fully transitioning rocket launch to the commercial sector will enable NASA to more devote its resources to the groundbreaking fundamental research that has for decades advanced humanity&#8217;s understanding of our planet and the universe around us.</p><p></p><h1>Liked This Read?</h1><p>Share with friends:</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/super-heavy-rockets?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/super-heavy-rockets?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p>If you don&#8217;t already subscribe to SpaceDotBiz, you can do so here:</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Interview with Investor Sunil Nagaraj, Partner at Ubiquity Ventures]]></title><description><![CDATA[For this week&#8217;s newsletter, I&#8217;m interviewing venture capital investor Sunil Nagaraj.

Can you expand more about your approach to venture capital?</h3><p>When I say that I invest in &#8220;software beyond the screen&#8221;, the focus is on powerful software, but not software tied to a personal computer or smartphone. It&#8217;s about software permeating the real physical world. That can mean software running on rockets, software that can run on cows, software that can run in space, on the side of a building, or in a hospital hallway. All of those are real Ubiquity portfolio companies and I think the opportunity here is massive, it&#8217;s the ability to solve real-world physical problems, but at the pace of software solutions.</p><p>Software can be a hundred times faster and cheaper to solve a problem. That was the case for Rocket Lab. When new rocket companies develop a rocket, it might be a $5 billion dollar program to get the vehicle working and Rocket Lab did it closer to the order of $50 million, so 100 times cheaper. That&#8217;s because Rocket Lab has software that&#8217;s core to their electric turbopump engine and a few other elements of their system. So when I say &#8220;software beyond the screen&#8221;, I mean powerful software starting to penetrate the real physical world and that&#8217;s why my VC firm is called Ubiquity Ventures, it&#8217;s a reference to ubiquitous software.</p><p>More tactically, that means that the areas I invest in have to do with smart hardware or machine learning. I view those two technologies as ways that software can jump off the screen. When it jumps off the screen, it needs somewhere to land and that&#8217;s typically smart hardware. Furthermore, when software jumps off the screen it also needs to understand, navigate, perceive, and adapt to the real world, which is also a great match for machine learning. Today Ubiquity is a roughly $100 million venture capital firm investing in smart hardware and machine learning but it&#8217;s a lot more fun to describe it as &#8220;software beyond the screen&#8221;.</p><p>The other side of your question on &#8220;nerdy and early&#8221;, I take very seriously as well. There are two ways to practice venture capital. One way is to look at businesses that have metrics to evaluate. You analyze the metrics in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, crunch the figures, and come out with an investment decision. I find that to be a bit boring. I also find that it misses a lot of upside compared to the second way of practicing venture capital: diving deep into code and technical trends, well before a company has revenue metrics or even usage metrics.</p><p>So when I say &#8220;nerdy and early&#8221;, those two things go hand in hand. Early means that for about a third of the companies I invest in, I invest the day they&#8217;re incorporated. So very, very early. I usually refer to this as seed or pre-seed investing. However, you can&#8217;t be &#8220;early&#8221; in my opinion if you can&#8217;t be &#8220;nerdy&#8221;, because if you&#8217;re &#8220;early&#8221; and you ask for an excel model, most entrepreneurs at that stage don&#8217;t have an excel model or traction figures. Most entrepreneurs I back don&#8217;t have revenue, so what I have to turn to instead is following technical trends, following technical people, and investing behind really big technical ideas that fall in line with software beyond the screen. So if it is a low-cost, lightweight physical solution to a physical problem that leverages a lot of software or smart hardware, then that falls in line with my thesis. &#8220;Nerdy and early&#8221; means that I try to spend my time hanging out with technical folks and understanding technical trends from the source, rather than reading about them in a Gartner report, at which point they&#8217;re lagging trends.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F204c1ef7-35de-4d3c-ad59-f0e901847800_728x900.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F204c1ef7-35de-4d3c-ad59-f0e901847800_728x900.jpeg" width="550" height="679.945054945055" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/204c1ef7-35de-4d3c-ad59-f0e901847800_728x900.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:900,&quot;width&quot;:728,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:550,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Image&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Image" title="Image" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F204c1ef7-35de-4d3c-ad59-f0e901847800_728x900.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F204c1ef7-35de-4d3c-ad59-f0e901847800_728x900.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F204c1ef7-35de-4d3c-ad59-f0e901847800_728x900.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F204c1ef7-35de-4d3c-ad59-f0e901847800_728x900.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Sunil with Rocket Lab Founder and CEO Peter Beck at the 2015 Space Symposium</figcaption></figure></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/sunil-nagaraj?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/sunil-nagaraj?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><h3>Ubiquity Ventures was an early investor in Loft Orbital, a company only four years old, that is already signing customer partnerships of over $100M. What do you look for in potential early-stage space investments and what did you see in Loft Orbital when you first invested years ago?</h3><p>With early-stage investing, when I&#8217;m investing before there are many metrics, I usually ask myself three very specific questions. It might be natural simply to ask myself &#8220;Do I like this product?&#8221;, but I think that&#8217;s a terrible way to make investments. I&#8217;m not looking for companies that I would use as a customer, so it doesn&#8217;t make sense to ask, &#8220;would I ever use the product myself?&#8221;. I think it&#8217;s very tempting to do that, especially when you watch something like Shark Tank and they&#8217;ll say &#8220;oh I would never use that&#8221;.</p><p>The three questions I ask myself are &#8220;Does anybody want this product?&#8221;, &#8220;Are there a lot of those people?&#8221;, and &#8220;Can this entrepreneur find them?&#8221;. Those three questions keep things simple, but they correspond to the business concepts of product-market fit, market size, and unit economics. In my day-to-day, most of my time is spent on question number one, &#8220;Does anybody want it?&#8221;. That&#8217;s trickier than it seems to evaluate. When I hear a pitch it is pretty helpful if an entrepreneur includes some customer quotes, prospective customer quotes, or expert quotes. During my own post-meeting diligence, I&#8217;ll often call a potential customer and describe this new product, but they&#8217;ll say &#8220;oh I don&#8217;t want that&#8221;. If I ended the diligence call there, that could be a mistake, so I&#8217;ll usually have to explain more and navigate the nuance of a prospective customer&#8217;s mind in order to figure out if this would be a good fit. So that&#8217;s the trickiest thing I do. I try to figure out if customers might buy the product or service in the future if it existed. Steve Jobs has a famous quote &#8220;it&#8217;s not the customer&#8217;s job to know what they want&#8221;, so it&#8217;s this delicate process of figuring out what might work if it existed.</p><p>If we shift gears to Loft Orbital, this was an investment where it was in one of my focus areas. I&#8217;ve met hundreds of space companies and what stood out about Loft was something I see very rarely among space startups. Loft Orbital had a pipeline of customers that spanned multiple categories. A lot of space startups have customers that are also space startups, so it&#8217;s risk-on-risk or startup-on-startup risk, which is tricky. Loft Orbital had interested customers across government, defense, domestic, international, legacy space, and new space. That diversity of customer pipeline was a really helpful signal to me that this is something attractive to a larger market and it&#8217;s a bit more real. When a larger company is interested in being a customer, it carries a bit more weight than if a small startup is.</p><p>The broader Loft Orbital thesis is that if we made space easier to access it would accelerate the size of the space market. As a result, I often compare Loft Orbital to Amazon Web Services. When AWS makes it easier to get your app or your code out to the world, you have the emergence of Web 2.0 and tons of internet startups exploding. I think AWS and other cloud infrastructure providers were behind that. You write your code, give it to them and they host it on their services, with cooling and electricity, and put it on the internet. You don&#8217;t even know where it is, but it is live to the whole world.</p><p>That&#8217;s conceptually very similar to Loft Orbital. You give Loft your payload, they certify it, get the FCC license, thermal test it, vibration test it, and then launch it for you into space and downlink the data. As a result, you can use space without being an expert in space. Between those two factors, diverse pipeline and great thematic fit, it was an easy decision to invest in Loft Orbital.</p><h3>You&#8217;ve been a venture capital investor in early-stage space companies for nearly 10 years. How has the space industry changed in that time?</h3><p>At my old firm, Bessemer, where I was until 2017, one of my old colleagues David Cowan invested in Skybox in 2010. Skybox sold to Google in 2014, which is when I got deeply involved in the space sector. Later that year in 2014 we invested in Rocket Lab&#8217;s Series B. At the time, they had conducted something like a two-second hot-fire test on one engine, so they were very early in their development. I would go to space conferences and be the only VC there &#8211;not a single other venture capitalist was present. Dedicated space venture capitalists didn&#8217;t exist as space hadn&#8217;t hit the radar of a lot of investors.</p><p>Space ideas were not yet tuned for the venture capital model, which would involve raising a seed round, then a year later raising a Series A, a year later raising a Series B, and so on. You have to fit the mold if you want to raise venture capital. Another part of the mold is that your idea can go from start to exit in less than ten years because venture capital funds are set up for ten years. None of those structures are important to the actual development of space technology, but you have to fit them if you&#8217;re going to take standard venture capital funding. What&#8217;s happened over the last ten years is that the average space founder now knows how to adapt their roadmap to fit the model so that they can secure this kind of capital.</p><p>At today&#8217;s space conferences, there are a dozen VCs actively participating which is a good thing for the industry. Now when people say ridiculous things like &#8220;space is hard&#8221; or &#8220;space is expensive&#8221; or &#8220;things blow up in space&#8221;, there&#8217;s enough conventional wisdom floating around the valley that says &#8220;no, that&#8217;s not necessarily true anymore&#8221; and that&#8217;s really powerful. I like to think I played a role in helping that trend. At every conference I went to, I&#8217;d speak on stage about why VCs are flocking to space and I&#8217;d go on my soapbox about &#8220;don&#8217;t say space is hard because it&#8217;s detrimental to the industry and it&#8217;s also not accurate anymore.&#8221; I think the space industry is feeling more like the tech industry with lower capex solutions, faster time to market, more agile iteration, and more VCs floating around. Now, we&#8217;re seeing a few dozen companies that have successfully raised late-stage funding rounds and are fitting the trajectory of a typical tech company.</p><h3>What excites you most about the future of the space industry?</h3><p>One of the most exciting parts about Loft Orbital serving as the AWS of space is that we don&#8217;t even know what applications will result. It&#8217;s a little bit like sitting in 1995 and AOL dial-up has been invented, and we don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re going to do with it next. As internet access became more pervasive, people thought of all sorts of crazy things, including delivery, online dating, storage, e-commerce, blogging, and others. Those things are coming in the space industry. I don&#8217;t know what they are and I&#8217;m not smart enough to see around that corner, but I am happy to be invested in a company (Loft Orbital) that&#8217;s helping to accelerate that trend and basically let a lot more people experiment with space.</p><p>I would say the advent of AWS and super easy access to web servers probably let a hundred times more people experiment with internet technologies and get their apps to the world. I hope that&#8217;s the case with space, if we have a hundred times more people experimenting with ideas for space, there will be things we haven&#8217;t even imagined. As we know, there are the main space categories of imaging, communications, navigation, and tourism. I hope an equal number of new categories emerge as well.</p><p>With the internet today, you can run a multi-billion dollar software company and have never seen a server in your life &#8211; and that&#8217;s potentially a good thing. Similarly, there&#8217;s a transition going on now where you can start to operate in space without having to lay all the groundwork for building a full satellite. You can give your payload to someone like Loft Orbital and have them host it for you.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h3>You have had the unique experience of not only being a venture investor but also founding your own venture capital firm. What were some of the biggest challenges and learnings in the process of starting your own fund?</h3><p>Raising a fund is very different from raising money for a startup. I&#8217;ve raised money for my own startup in 2009/2010 and then I&#8217;ve invested in startups, but raising money for a fund means that you&#8217;re asking people to give you money without a specific place it&#8217;s going to go. When any of the Ubiquity companies raise money, there&#8217;s a pitch, &#8220;here&#8217;s the product, here are the people, here are the customers&#8221;. It&#8217;s fairly specific. At the very beginning of any fund, especially your first fund, which I raised in 2017, it&#8217;s just a bunch of slides.</p><p>Ubiquity&#8217;s fund I was a $30M fund, so I offered my investors fewer specifics than a seed-stage startup would, but I was asking for 10x more than a seed-stage startup. That&#8217;s a big leap of faith and I&#8217;m appreciative that my early Limited Partners, the investors in my fund, backed me with no concrete specifics about where the money was going to go. I told them that I would invest in 20 companies that would fit into the themes we outlined earlier. Then I asked them to trust me. It&#8217;s a fundamentally different process and I don&#8217;t think I appreciated how big of a leap of faith LPs have to take, especially in a first fund but generally in any fund. Unlike investing in a startup, you&#8217;re committing capital for the next ten years with much less governance than in a typical startup investment.</p><p>To the extent anyone&#8217;s considering raising a new fund, the key is to gain trust with as many LPs as possible, and try to push from vague themes to more specifics. It also usually helps a lot when you have one investment in your fund, so if you can raise a little bit of your fund and put one investment into the fund, it means you&#8217;re serious, you&#8217;re already starting, but most importantly, folks can evaluate that one company as a concrete asset as opposed to a thematic idea.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d55c288-6b09-4d2f-9dd7-f370256d7d1f_1024x768.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d55c288-6b09-4d2f-9dd7-f370256d7d1f_1024x768.jpeg" width="566" height="424.5" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1d55c288-6b09-4d2f-9dd7-f370256d7d1f_1024x768.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:768,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:566,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d55c288-6b09-4d2f-9dd7-f370256d7d1f_1024x768.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d55c288-6b09-4d2f-9dd7-f370256d7d1f_1024x768.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d55c288-6b09-4d2f-9dd7-f370256d7d1f_1024x768.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d55c288-6b09-4d2f-9dd7-f370256d7d1f_1024x768.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Sunil at Cape Canaveral, attending the launch of Loft Orbital&#8217;s satellites.

So I&#8217;m passionate about both and luckily they have a little bit of synergy, but I&#8217;ve found they tend to be distinct worlds.</p><p>My passion for astronomy originated before I can remember, I&#8217;ve always been obsessed with stars, planets, and questions of &#8220;where did we come from&#8221;. I was especially interested in the search for exoplanets and life, so I&#8217;m a little involved in the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute. I was a little involved in the Kepler project as well, which was a search for other Earth-like planets in our Milky Way galaxy. Now I&#8217;m with the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP). It is a parallel effort to investing in space and it&#8217;s quite fun.</p><p>One neat thing from the ASP, a relatively recent project we did, was to create the astronomy badge for the girl scouts. So we do a wide variety of educational outreach projects to push astronomy as an entry into science. It&#8217;s an easy way to connect the dots as to why science matters and for people to fall in love with astronomy, it doesn&#8217;t mean they need to be a professional astronomer, but it is a good way to enter STEM fields</p><h3><strong>To read more from Sunil, subscribe to his newsletter, Ubiquitous Thoughts:</strong></h3><div class="embedded-publication-wrap"

Space Angels provides insights and investment opportunities in the &#8220;space economy&#8221; and offers investors a sleek platform to manage their portfolios. The firm sources &#8220;only the top 1% of space investment opportunities&#8221;. Through Space Angels, investors have access to early and growth-stage investment opportunities as they become available.&nbsp;</p><p>So far, the platform has provided private investors access to big names in the space industry, including Rocket Lab (which builds rockets), Planet (which maps Earth from orbit), LeoLabs (uses radar to track objects in space), and SpaceX (which builds rockets and offers space internet).</p><p>The Space Angels team also operates a traditional venture capital fund called Space Capital. The fund finds companies and invests on behalf of its Limited Partners. The first Space Capital fund, started in 2017, invested $16 million<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a> in over a dozen companies; Space Capital is currently investing out of their second fund.

For the other platforms I&#8217;ve discussed, individual investors must check certain boxes&#8212;for example, they must be qualified to make private investments according to government-set minimums on income or net worth. By contrast, anyone can invest on the Spaced Ventures platform. Because Spaced Ventures crowdfunds to raise capital for space startups, individuals can invest as little as $100 into each company while still taking equity ownership. Companies are identified and vetted by Spaced Ventures and made available to investors on a rolling basis. The firm&#8217;s approach reflects its goal: To build the largest community of investors in the space industry.</p><p>Spaced Ventures also maintains an extensive database of funding rounds in the space industry, a resource available for free on their website.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd93a8fb3-9cdb-4695-8eca-320003e46f71_1877x828.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd93a8fb3-9cdb-4695-8eca-320003e46f71_1877x828.png" width="1456" height="642" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d93a8fb3-9cdb-4695-8eca-320003e46f71_1877x828.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:642,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:180485,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd93a8fb3-9cdb-4695-8eca-320003e46f71_1877x828.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd93a8fb3-9cdb-4695-8eca-320003e46f71_1877x828.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd93a8fb3-9cdb-4695-8eca-320003e46f71_1877x828.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd93a8fb3-9cdb-4695-8eca-320003e46f71_1877x828.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Spaced Ventures database of funding rounds.

What drew you to space in the first place and then what led to becoming a space investor?</strong></h3><p>Sally Ride, the first American female astronaut, who went to my childhood school when she was a young girl, came back and spoke when I was attending the school years later. Seeing this brilliant badass lady talk on stage inspired me to follow in her footsteps and aspire to be an astronaut. That started with getting degrees in the field &#8211; I got an undergrad and master&#8217;s in aerospace engineering &#8211; and worked at various space companies. During grad school, I discovered venture capital, which is what I do now, investing in space, deep tech founders, and companies turning theory into reality and pushing the industry forward.</p><h3><strong>You published an article back in 2018 called Space is Open for Business about the evolving commercial ecosystem in the space industry.

I don&#8217;t think anyone would have expected that back in 2018. On the other hand, as expected, we are seeing vertical integration in the industry, specifically between rocket and satellite companies. The two most prominent examples are SpaceX + Starlink and Rocket Lab + Photon. SpaceX has acquired Swarm and Rocket Lab has acquired Sinclair, Advanced Solutions, Planetary Systems, and SolAero.</p><h3><strong>What is something that you wish more entrepreneurs knew when they start reaching out to early-stage investors about raising funding?</strong></h3><p>It&#8217;s a relationship/conversation! I encourage all entrepreneurs to do as much diligence on the investor as the investor does on the company. Call up every CEO/founder the investor has worked with and ask them about working with the investor. Emphasis needs to be on the person, and not just the firm. You are about to partner with this person for the foreseeable future so make sure you two are the right match.</p><div><hr></div><p>Sponsored by:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d71bfd0-7033-4bca-bf91-5251163170d5_2400x1600.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d71bfd0-7033-4bca-bf91-5251163170d5_2400x1600.jpeg" width="672" height="447.79636363636365" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8d71bfd0-7033-4bca-bf91-5251163170d5_2400x1600.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:733,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:672,&quot;bytes&quot;:477622,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d71bfd0-7033-4bca-bf91-5251163170d5_2400x1600.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d71bfd0-7033-4bca-bf91-5251163170d5_2400x1600.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d71bfd0-7033-4bca-bf91-5251163170d5_2400x1600.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d71bfd0-7033-4bca-bf91-5251163170d5_2400x1600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Payload is the leading daily newsletter for space insiders.

Now that it is public, it will continue to collect and democratize this data for important applications like preventing illegal fishing and disaster response/prevention.

I fundamentally believe we need to be a multi-planet species in order to survive &#8211; and this isn&#8217;t to give up here on Earth, but because the technology needed to get to and sustain life elsewhere will help fix the problems we currently face here. For example, the list of technologies that have resulted from space exploration, from MRI/CT Scanning technology to implantable heart monitors to water purification systems to laser eye surgery, is endless. I&#8217;m confident when we go back to the moon and beyond, more incredibly important technologies that help us here on Earth will be added to that list.</p><div><hr></div><p>Before we wrap up, I want to share information on an organization that Tess supports, the Brooke Owens Fellowship.

Once again, investors are funneling billions of dollars into ambitious projects that, even if all goes according to plan, will take years to generate revenue. And some new companies, like OneWeb, have already followed the path of its unsuccessful predecessors, attracting investment, crashing, and then scrambling out of bankruptcy under the yolk of new ownership.</p><p>But I believe things are different today. Why? For the first time, investors&#8217; investments are starting to pay off. Fundamentally, investors need to believe that the money they spend&#8212;on propping up an infant space company, for example&#8212;will be earned back (and then some). In other words, investors need to be confident that they&#8217;ll turn a profit at some point, a point called an <em>exit event.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>In the space industry, these high-value exit events are finally happening; investors have reason to be confident.</p><p>So far, the most common event is a space company going public, particularly through SPAC mergers. The SPAC&#8217;ing process isn&#8217;t perfect (see my article on<a href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/spacs"> Space SPAC&#8217;s</a>), but it does mean that&#8212;once companies are public&#8212;early-stage investors can sell their equity in public markets and get their money back.</p><p>There&#8217;s progress elsewhere, too. For example, new space companies are increasingly acquiring venture-capital-funded startups, providing more opportunities for early-stage investors to reap rewards. SpaceX and Astra just acquired venture-funded space companies Swarm Space and Apollo Fusion, respectively.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17e76f6a-2e55-42ff-9f28-20543f99ae1b_862x485.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17e76f6a-2e55-42ff-9f28-20543f99ae1b_862x485.jpeg" width="644" height="362.3433874709977" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/17e76f6a-2e55-42ff-9f28-20543f99ae1b_862x485.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:485,&quot;width&quot;:862,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:644,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Apollo Fusion obtains Hall thruster technology from JPL - SpaceNews&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Apollo Fusion obtains Hall thruster technology from JPL - SpaceNews" title="Apollo Fusion obtains Hall thruster technology from JPL - SpaceNews" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17e76f6a-2e55-42ff-9f28-20543f99ae1b_862x485.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17e76f6a-2e55-42ff-9f28-20543f99ae1b_862x485.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17e76f6a-2e55-42ff-9f28-20543f99ae1b_862x485.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17e76f6a-2e55-42ff-9f28-20543f99ae1b_862x485.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Test of Apollo Fusion&#8217;s Hall Thruster.

Better still, the acquirers (like SpaceX and Astra) were <em>themselves</em> venture-funded startups, living proof that the &#8220;older&#8221; startups of today&#8217;s wave of space investment have become, in mere years, robust enough to buy up-and-coming space startups. There are only a handful of case studies like these, but they point to the birth of a healthy space economy.</p><p>Energized by this progress, early-stage investors seem to be outgrowing their &#8220;wait-and-see&#8221; hesitance, instead reinvesting in space companies. And the exits are also encouraging early investors to bet on the industry with more gusto.</p><h1>Will It Last?</h1><p>I believe this is an unprecedented time for the space industry, but it&#8217;s too early to know anything for certain. Today, companies years out from profitability can tap into capital markets as needed, but this won&#8217;t always be the case; the commercial space industry may face its ultimate litmus test during the next market downturn.</p><p>We&#8217;ve seen this before. Toward the end of the last space-investment cycle in the early 2000s, and as the dot-com bubble burst, companies struggled to raise capital. While some space companies survived (e.g., DirectTV), many more faced bankruptcy.</p><p>I spoke recently with Aerospace Corporation CEO Steve Isakowitz about this. He said:</p><blockquote><h4>The real test will be whether we get the necessary returns. I think many believe that not all these companies are going to survive. There will be at some point a falling out, but that&#8217;s okay, like in any area of venture investment, you&#8217;re looking for a few big hits to be the ones that transform the industry and I think we&#8217;re seeing a few transformative ones coming to the forefront.</h4></blockquote><p>You can read the full interview <a href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/steve-isakowitz">here</a>.</p><p>So now, the big question: Does the space industry have enough momentum to survive the shock of a market downturn? The honest answer is that we&#8217;ll find out when that happens. But given the flurry of recent, successful exit events and the meteoric rise of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/08/elon-musks-spacex-valuation-100-billion.html">SpaceX&#8217;s valuation</a>, I think the industry is in a healthier position than it was in the funding wave of the 1990s. Only time will tell&#8212;but I&#8217;m optimistic.</p><div><hr></div><h1>Liked This Read?</h1><p>Please share with friends:</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/y-combinator?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMzEzMTgzMiwicG9zdF9pZCI6NDA3MjQ1NzEsImlhdCI6MTYzODMxMzU0MywiaXNzIjoicHViLTIxODI4MSIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.R5raAq24536hAbMPOiBWXUm1IId_ds1mQf6iOFE-j1w&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/y-combinator?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMzEzMTgzMiwicG9zdF9pZCI6NDA3MjQ1NzEsImlhdCI6MTYzODMxMzU0MywiaXNzIjoicHViLTIxODI4MSIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.R5raAq24536hAbMPOiBWXUm1IId_ds1mQf6iOFE-j1w"><span>Share</span></a></p><p>If you don&#8217;t already subscribe to SpaceDotBiz, you can do so here:</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div class="footnote" id="footnote-1"><a href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/cathie-woods-space-etf-arkx-on-track-to-success-trading-2021-4</p></div></div><div class="footnote" id="footnote-2"><a href="#footnote-anchor-2" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false">2</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2017/09/30/more-on-the-cover-storyspace-startup-boom-has.html</p><p></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[When Rocket Companies Become More Than Rocket Companies]]></title><description><![CDATA[What happens when rocket companies start doing business in space?]]></description><link>https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/beyond-launch</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/beyond-launch</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Ian Vorbach]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 19:14:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a1f398b-95e7-4076-bf66-3d307157a8f5_722x549.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>There&#8217;s an interesting trend taking place amongst rocket companies in the space industry.

It&#8217;s increasingly common that the organizations that were founded for the purpose of providing launch services are having much broader ambitions.</p><p>It begs the question, why don&#8217;t these organizations focus solely on building rockets? Why do they opt to also compete in markets for satellite buses, lunar landers, satellite constellations, and more?</p><p>These are some of the topics we&#8217;ll explore in today&#8217;s newsletter.

After first providing a decade of launch services, SpaceX seeks to offer global broadband internet services through the implementation of a LEO satellite constellation named Starlink.</p><p>SpaceX has consistently emphasized that their Starlink broadband internet service has a much larger addressable market than their launch business. Specifically, the launch market seems to max out at around $3B while they project Starlink&#8217;s addressable market to be closer to $30B-$40B.</p><p>If Starlink is ultimately successful at the scale that they hope, the value of SpaceX as a corporation will be almost entirely due to the Starlink business. SpaceX has been favorably rewarded for its Starlink project so far, with the company&#8217;s valuation reaching $100B in its most recent secondary market offering. Without the Starlink business, SpaceX simply could not continue to grow aggressively by only providing launch services, which have peaked somewhere around 10-15 launches per year for commercial and government customers.</p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F273fa1a6-582a-4e41-9cb3-ab15b4d70d3d_855x736.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F273fa1a6-582a-4e41-9cb3-ab15b4d70d3d_855x736.png" width="458" height="394.2549707602339" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/273fa1a6-582a-4e41-9cb3-ab15b4d70d3d_855x736.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:736,&quot;width&quot;:855,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:458,&quot;bytes&quot;:889092,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F273fa1a6-582a-4e41-9cb3-ab15b4d70d3d_855x736.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F273fa1a6-582a-4e41-9cb3-ab15b4d70d3d_855x736.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F273fa1a6-582a-4e41-9cb3-ab15b4d70d3d_855x736.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F273fa1a6-582a-4e41-9cb3-ab15b4d70d3d_855x736.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Starlink user terminal.

Source: Rocket Lab</figcaption></figure></div><p>Given that RocketLab is now a publicly-traded company, we can see how the introduction of a Space Systems business is playing out. The organization&#8217;s public reporting illustrates an interesting dynamic.</p><p>In September 2021, RocketLab shared its first half of 2021 performance. In the document, they reported gross margins for the entire company as 13% and margins for their Space Systems business in particular as 65%. The majority of Rocket Lab&#8217;s income comes from launch, so we can see that launch margins are less than 13%.</p><p>I&#8217;m not pointing out these numbers to pick on Rocket Lab, but rather to note that they are actually ahead of the curve in adapting to a challenging, but not widely discussed reality. Launch is a low-margin business. Rocket Lab has recognized this and is investing heavily into their Space Systems business. A business which they are aiming to ramp up quickly, with revenue increasing 12x from the first half of 2020 to the first half of 2021. </p><p>Furthermore, companies like Rocket Lab have noticed the impact the projected revenues for SpaceX&#8217;s Starlink program have had in boosting SpaceX&#8217;s valuation from around $20B to now up to $100B. These companies are obviously always looking for ways to provide growth for investors and new business lines are necessary for doing so.</p><p>We are seeing other small launch leadership be more open about the limitations of the launch business as well. In a recent CNBC article<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a>, Firefly CEO Tom Markusic stated that &#8220;The rocket gives you the keys to space. It&#8217;s critically important, but the big revenue is doing things in space.&#8221; He made it clear that Firefly&#8217;s major revenue growth is for in-space services. In the near term, this focus is towards the company&#8217;s lunar lander system Blue Ghost. &#8220;Blue Ghost, fully loaded with payload, can generate about $150 million of revenue for the company,&#8221; continued Markusic. That is compared to about $15M in revenue per launch for its Alpha rocket.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h1>Competing For Space Services Against Companies With Their Own Launch Programs</h1><p>The consequences of launch companies offering in-space services are broad. These factors become impactful for the competing organizations that exclusively offer in-space products and do not have their own rockets. Launch is a gatekeeping element to operating a business in space. Having easy and affordable access to launch not only allows you to test and deploy your systems more cheaply, but it can accelerate your development timelines by years.  This is no more evident right now than in the competition to provide LEO broadband internet.</p><p>OneWeb, founded in 2012, was the first company of the past decade to begin the development of a LEO broadband internet system. While they have made significant  strides in deploying their satellite constellation, with 358 out of 648 of its original satellite constellation already in orbit, OneWeb has been greatly outpaced in their deployment by Starlink. SpaceX, with its Falcon 9 rocket, already has 1,646 Starlink satellites in orbit. Furthermore, the costs of paying third-party launch providers, likely at about $150M per launch, was a contributing factor to Oneweb going through Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2020.

However, for markets that require large numbers of satellites to be deployed and where those satellites need to be refreshed with a high frequency, it would be a difficult prospect to compete with a company that can launch those satellites themselves.</p><p>As a result, I would expect that all of the launch companies will be introducing other space capabilities in the near term. Furthermore, I would not be surprised if we see an increasing rate of partnerships, mergers, or acquisitions between launch companies and organizations providing in-space services. We are seeing this with organizations that are choosing to enter new markets by acquiring the capabilities rather than building them entirely in-house. Examples include Astra acquiring Apollo Fusion, a satellite propulsion provider, or Rocket Lab acquiring Sinclair, a satellite component manufacturer.</p><p>I ultimately think this is going to be how small launch companies can attempt to avoid a broader consolidation in that market. There seemingly isn&#8217;t enough demand for them all to survive simply as small launchers. However, if they can each leverage launch as a competitive advantage towards their own in-space product/services markets, then maybe there won&#8217;t be as many failed small launch companies as was always anticipated.</p><div><hr></div><h1>Liked This Read?</h1><p>Please share with friends:</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/y-combinator?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMzEzMTgzMiwicG9zdF9pZCI6NDA3MjQ1NzEsImlhdCI6MTYzODMxMzU0MywiaXNzIjoicHViLTIxODI4MSIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.R5raAq24536hAbMPOiBWXUm1IId_ds1mQf6iOFE-j1w&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/y-combinator?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMzEzMTgzMiwicG9zdF9pZCI6NDA3MjQ1NzEsImlhdCI6MTYzODMxMzU0MywiaXNzIjoicHViLTIxODI4MSIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.R5raAq24536hAbMPOiBWXUm1IId_ds1mQf6iOFE-j1w"><span>Share</span></a></p><p>If you don&#8217;t already subscribe to SpaceDotBiz, you can do so here:</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Want to read more about space startups that have gone on to reach public markets?

What is Quilty Analytics and what services does the organization provide in the space industry?</strong></h4><p><strong>Caleb</strong>: <em>Quilty Analytics is a research and advisory firm that is specialized in the space industry. Our exclusive focus is all things that pertain to space. The company is essentially split into two halves. One half  does investment banking and strategic advisory. There they help with activities like brokering merger and acquisition deals, IPOs, divestitures, and those kinds of strategic level transactions.</em></p><p><em>The other half is research, which is where I&#8217;m involved. Part of that is focused on writing reports about specific companies, we follow about eight or so publicly traded companies within the space industry. We also have thematic reports where we dive into particular topics. For example, we&#8217;ve written reports on smallsat manufacturing and flat-panel antennas, as well as a series on various LEO constellations such as OneWeb, Starlink, and Telesat. Just recently we published a report on the Space Development Agency&#8217;s national Defense Space Architecture constellation as well.</em></p><p><em>Those are our two primary research types and we occasionally do some consulting as well. A lot of that comes from companies that are not in the space industry but are interested in being a part of it, so they come to us to learn more about the industry.</em></p><h4><strong>Last year you made the switch from being a journalist with SpaceNews to joining Quilty. Can you talk about your background in becoming a space journalist and then what led to that transition from journalism to now being on the research side?</strong></h4><p><strong>Caleb</strong>: <em>I sort of fell backwards into the space industry. I say that because my fields of study were political science and astronomy. I didn&#8217;t quite know what I wanted to do with that and just always hoped that I would end up in the space industry. With that combination, I thought that I might end up somewhere like NASA since I was principally aware of government-led space activity. In college, I learned more about the private sector of space. I landed a job with Via Satellite because I was looking at journalism jobs and found an opportunity where I could combine the writing skills that I had obtained in college as a political science major, merge them with the science skills from my experiences in astronomy, and apply them to journalism.</em></p><p><em>Then I joined Quilty Analytics about a year ago, looking to shift away from the daily deadlines of news journalism but still be involved in the space industry. I decided to work in research where I&#8217;m still learning a lot and am still able to operate from a neutral standpoint while sharing my findings with a community.</em></p><p></p><h4><strong>We&#8217;ve seen a growing amount of M&amp;A activity in &#8220;New Space&#8221; in recent months. A few examples are SpaceX acquiring Swarm, Rocket Lab acquiring Sinclair Interplanetary, and Astra acquiring Apollo Fusion. Do you think we&#8217;re going to see more of this going forward and what do you think this trend might mean about the state of the space industry?</strong></h4><p><strong>Caleb</strong>: <em>I think broadly you&#8217;re seeing exits in a couple different ways: M&amp;A activity and SPACs. The space industry was notoriously slow at exits, and that was one of the challenges for VC&#8217;s and for startups who were starting to see more money flowing into the industry. People would get excited and then you weren&#8217;t seeing the exits, so that created a sort of disconnect.</em></p><p><em>SPACs have provided a meaningful way to have exits that justify venture capital going into the industry. SPACs really picked up after some initial hesitancy around the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, we&#8217;ve started to see SPAC activity slow but not stop. I would expect to see a few more SPAC deals announced next year in the first half of 2022. However, I really think that the bigger impact that you&#8217;re seeing now is that those SPACs are now under pressure to justify the claims that they made during their IPO process. A lot of them put up really high valuations and really large total addressable markets that they said they could pursue, as well as really aggressive revenue figures. In order for them to meet expectations, a lot of times it means that they are going to have to grow inorganically.</em></p><p><em>You see that with companies like Astra and Rocket Lab that have described themselves as being more than launch providers. They want to be turnkey solutions that can build your spacecraft, launch it, and even help beyond that. In order for them to do that, they have to acquire companies to gain those skills and resources faster than they could by building them up internally.</em></p><p><em>Another factor driving M&amp;A activity is a big drive across the industry for scale. That&#8217;s something a lot of private equity firms have led, where you see roll-ups of a bunch of small companies. For example, even before they SPAC&#8217;d, Redwire was one of the top buyers of small to medium enterprises. Others doing that include Voyager Space, Amergent Technologies, and BlueHalo. You&#8217;re seeing a lot of these companies that have realized they can do more together than they could separately.</em></p><p><em>So that is fueling this consolidation amongst all of these smaller players, some of which were household names, some of which weren&#8217;t. That&#8217;s creating a more robust mid-tier layer of space companies in the US that wasn&#8217;t really present before.</em></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc26542bb-1efb-4e6d-9dd6-0a4019b874db_2512x1402.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc26542bb-1efb-4e6d-9dd6-0a4019b874db_2512x1402.png" width="1456" height="813" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c26542bb-1efb-4e6d-9dd6-0a4019b874db_2512x1402.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:813,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3193282,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc26542bb-1efb-4e6d-9dd6-0a4019b874db_2512x1402.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc26542bb-1efb-4e6d-9dd6-0a4019b874db_2512x1402.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc26542bb-1efb-4e6d-9dd6-0a4019b874db_2512x1402.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc26542bb-1efb-4e6d-9dd6-0a4019b874db_2512x1402.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Henry interviewing NASA Administrator Bridenstine for SpaceNews in 2018</figcaption></figure></div><h4><strong>You mentioned that there has been, understandably, a focus on exits from the investment community. Do you think the exits we&#8217;re seeing, either through M&amp;A or SPACs, are within the range that will keep early-stage investors interested in the industry?</strong></h4><p><strong>Caleb</strong>: <em>Well we have noticed an increase in the size of large early-stage rounds. You regularly see companies that are raising over $100M rounds. If you look at venture capital investments in the space industry, excluding LEO broadband like Starlink or Kuiper, the amount of investment has steadily grown. In 2016, there was less than $500M invested in space. It has been over a billion every year since and in 2020 it topped $2B. So there&#8217;s been absolutely no slow-down. We haven&#8217;t compiled numbers yet for 2021, so I can&#8217;t quite say what the near-term impact has looked like but in terms of venture deals there hasn&#8217;t been a slowdown, and if anything the rounds have only gotten bigger. Which speaks to even higher levels of confidence by the VC community in the space industry.</em></p><h4><strong>You touched upon the LEO constellations and there&#8217;s debate around the scale of the market demand for these services. Do you have thoughts on the size of that demand and whether there&#8217;s room for all of these competitors to survive and even thrive? Or do you expect some consolidation in that market?</strong></h4><p><strong>Caleb</strong>: <em>If you went to industry conferences around the late 2010s, the average person would tell you that two, maybe three LEO constellations would survive. Now when you ask people, the average answer that I hear is four, maybe five. Which is about all that are out there. So that&#8217;s essentially saying that the majority will succeed, at least for those that have been announced. However, there are surely constellations that have not been disclosed.</em> </p><p><em>A couple of factors will influence which constellations are successful. One is money. Part of the reason that the confidence level increased is because Amazon emerged and Amazon has no shortage of cash, so that constellation is all but guaranteed to be constructed. If they can get the technology to work, they have the money and the distribution to go forward. Elon [Musk] has shown an incredible ability to raise large sums of money for SpaceX, which keeps Starlink healthy. OneWeb already went through its Chapter 11 process and essentially emerged as a discount constellation. Eutelsat got in on that by investing in OneWeb. It seems that they didn&#8217;t want to help fund a $6B constellation but they were fine with funding a $2B-$3B constellation. When you cut all that happened prior to Chapter 11, it made much more economic sense.</em></p><p><em>The second factor is with respect to what markets those constellations will serve. Not all constellations are created equal. We&#8217;re seeing a divide between which constellations are pursuing the consumer broadband market, which is arguably the biggest, and which are designed to serve higher paying customers in mobility. That&#8217;s usually broken down into inflight connectivity, maritime, and mobile land vehicles such as trains, trucks, or military vehicles. Those higher paying customers also include enterprise businesses that need connectivity such as oil rigs, cloud data centers, or things of that nature.</em></p><p><em>What we&#8217;re also seeing is a real shift towards a multi-orbit future, what is sometimes referred to as a hybrid architecture. It&#8217;s probably not going to be favorable to have service from just one orbit. Even if you have LEO operators like SpaceX and Amazon go forward, I think lots of customers are planning networks around using satellites in LEO, GEO, and even elsewhere like MEO or highly elliptical orbits. That looks like it&#8217;s very much going to be the future, people want to combine the advantages of each one. They want the low-latency from LEO, the density of capacity that you can put down from GEO, polar coverage that you can get from LEO or GEO, and the ability to dynamically steer capacity quickly across large geographies that you can get from GEO.</em></p><p><em>So that&#8217;s probably the future that we anticipate. It&#8217;s less about who wins and who loses and more about what the broader future of satellite communications looks like. That future is likely not principally defined by a single architecture.</em></p><h4><strong>Is there anything in the industry that you&#8217;re particularly excited about in the coming years?</strong></h4><p><strong>Caleb</strong>: <em>You know it&#8217;s hard to point to one single thing. What excites me is that the industry is finally moving at speed. The space industry is a really high-tech industry and because of that, it gets a lot of people excited. Historically though it has moved very slowly. It has moved slow for one because it&#8217;s risk-averse. If you are spending two or three years building a spacecraft and then it has to last for fifteen years or more, you don't want to do things that might cause it to break. The second reason it moves slowly is that, particularly in broadband, it was principally a service of last resort. Satellites were great for TV, you had some advances in technology that made it so you could handle more channels with less capacity, but that wasn&#8217;t really that revolutionary nor was it particularly fast-paced.</em></p><p><em>Now though, because the satellite industry is trying to get in on providing connectivity everywhere, the standard for innovation is the same for the space industry as it is for terrestrial companies. The industry is not used to moving at iPhone speeds or having any sort of regular iterative design where every year you see something newer or better. However, the industry is learning that it has to meet those speeds of innovation. So how do you progress in a way that assures that you don&#8217;t disappoint customers?</em></p><p><em>Beyond those newfound customer expectations, the industry is also moving faster because newer technologies allow it to do so. These include 3D printing, cloud computing, onboard processing, and software-defined spacecraft. Those technologies have allowed the industry to move at a much quicker pace. That means that we can see a lot more change in a lot shorter period of time and that&#8217;s exciting.</em></p><p><em>I think that the space industry is going to look radically different ten years from now. Not only that, I think the changes ten years forward are going to be more than than they were looking twenty years back.</em></p><h4><strong>What do you think isn&#8217;t getting enough attention in the space industry right now?</strong></h4><p><strong>Caleb</strong>: <em>Well, there&#8217;s nothing that I would personally seek to draw any attention to. If you&#8217;re going to ask about one area of the industry that is under-observed, it&#8217;s always the ground segment. It&#8217;s the least shiny of the things that the space industry does, but the two have to go together. You can&#8217;t launch a massive satellite constellation with terabits of capacity and expect to actually get that down unless you have a strong and capable network of teleports, gateways, and access nodes on the ground. There are some really interesting technologies that are moving forward there too. You&#8217;re seeing for example the shift to the cloud. On the Earth observation side, you can see more downlinking directly into cloud data centers and that has truly accelerated the speed at which we can get images of the Earth or weather data from satellites.</em></p><p><em>I think you&#8217;re also seeing more network virtualization. The smallsat teams have led this. If you used to visit a command center of an Intelsat or an Iridium, they would have people staffed twenty-four seven watching and flying the satellites. I recently talked to a smallsat operator who actually told me he monitors satellites from his phone. Things are changing.</em></p><p><em>A few other things that come to mind include using higher frequencies, more geographic diversity of sites, and then Ground as a Service where you see companies building their own networks of ground stations and just going to satellite operators and saying &#8220;we can get all of your data down for you and we can even fly your satellites for you if you don&#8217;t want to do that.&#8221;</em></p><p><em>The ground segment is a very tech-heavy part of the space industry, but it&#8217;s often not looked at because a rocket is not involved in making it happen. However, it&#8217;s equally important for the success of the industry going forward.</em></p><h4><strong>Want to hear more from Caleb?

That puts it into the category of a super heavy-lift class rocket (those that can carry over 110,000 lbs to LEO). I&#8217;ll be covering those rockets in a future post.</p><h2>Ariane 5</h2><p><strong>Originating Entity:</strong>&nbsp;European Space Agency</p><p><strong>Payload Capacity:</strong> 21,000 kg to LEO</p><p><strong>Maturity</strong>:&nbsp;Currently Flying</p><p>The Ariane 5 is the largest rocket developed by the European Space Agency. Its first successful launch took place in 1998 and it has flown successfully 104 times since. The vehicle&#8217;s central core stage, which uses a combination of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, has two solid rocket boosters attached to the sides. These boosters offer additional thrust to the rocket&#8217;s initial ascent from the launch pad. At a cost of around $150M per launch, Ariane 5&#8217;s pricing is fairly competitive for the heavy-lift category. This explains why it is such a frequently flying vehicle, with customers both inside and outside the European Union. Customers range from high-value European national security projects like the Galileo global navigation system, to international commercial ventures like Koreasat 6, and even one-of-a-kind scientific projects like NASA&#8217;s upcoming James Webb Telescope scientific missions. While the Ariane 5 rocket has launches scheduled at least through 2022, the European Space Agency is looking to introduce the next-generation Ariane 6 in the coming years which, when originally planned, was hoping to cost just half as much per launch as the Ariane 5 while maintaining a similar payload capacity.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd5f4a11-7c9e-4f27-bea8-5f8ac464f05f_480x270.gif"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd5f4a11-7c9e-4f27-bea8-5f8ac464f05f_480x270.gif" width="596" height="335.25" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fd5f4a11-7c9e-4f27-bea8-5f8ac464f05f_480x270.gif&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:270,&quot;width&quot;:480,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:596,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;giphy.com An English term for this is the use of countdown.

The Long March 5 is a newer vehicle, its first launch was in 2016 and it has only had seven launch attempts in total. The recent development of the Long March 5 is itself a demonstration of China&#8217;s desire to invest further in high-value scientific projects as well as human exploration. Without such a powerful rocket, China would not have been able to launch its Tianwen-1 spacecraft to Mars in 2020 and subsequently become the second nation to successfully put a rover on Mars. Furthermore, the rocket has most recently been used to launch Tianhe, the core module of its in-construction permanent space station in low Earth orbit. With almost all of its upcoming launches planned for assembling its space station or sending payloads to the Moon, the Long March 5 is a key component of China&#8217;s ambitions for becoming a leader in human and robotic space exploration.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b1a7402-0735-416d-a0a5-40a63c235d5b_520x292.gif"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b1a7402-0735-416d-a0a5-40a63c235d5b_520x292.gif" width="520" height="292" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5b1a7402-0735-416d-a0a5-40a63c235d5b_520x292.gif&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:292,&quot;width&quot;:520,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Best Long March 5 B GIFs | Gfycat&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Best Long March 5 B GIFs | Gfycat" title="Best Long March 5 B GIFs | Gfycat" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b1a7402-0735-416d-a0a5-40a63c235d5b_520x292.gif 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b1a7402-0735-416d-a0a5-40a63c235d5b_520x292.gif 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b1a7402-0735-416d-a0a5-40a63c235d5b_520x292.gif 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b1a7402-0735-416d-a0a5-40a63c235d5b_520x292.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Long March 5 launch.</figcaption></figure></div><h2>Vulcan Centaur</h2><p><strong>Originating Entity:</strong>&nbsp;United Launch Alliance (ULA)</p><p><strong>Payload Capacity:</strong>&nbsp;27,000 kg to LEO</p><p><strong>Maturity</strong>:&nbsp;In Development</p><p>In 2014, the United States Congress imposed a ban on US launch vehicles using Russian purchased engines. This had the primary effect of requiring United Launch Alliance to phase out its successful Atlas V vehicle which uses first stage RD-180 engines purchased from Russian company Energomash. Consequently, development began in 2014 on ULA&#8217;s next-generation vehicle, Vulcan Centaur. ULA decided it would purchase BE-4 engines from Blue Origin as the first stage engines for the Vulcan Centaur rocket, the same engines that Blue Origin will use for its New Glenn rocket. With a lift capacity well above the Atlas V and similar to the Delta IV heavy, Vulcan Centaur is planned to replace both of those ULA rockets. Meanwhile, Vulcan is intended to reduce costs significantly, with costs anticipated anywhere from $80M to $200M while Delta IV Heavy currently costs closer to $350M. Vulcan has been largely funded by government contracts and the company has received almost $1.2B in funding towards Vulcan development from the US Air Force and the National Security Space Launch program. Vulcan Centaur&#8217;s first launch had previously been planned for 2021 but the timing has been pushed back to 2022, likely due to delays in delivery of the BE-4 engines from Blue Origin.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef7ca52c-3b89-4cba-b245-166254d2c1a7_683x666.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef7ca52c-3b89-4cba-b245-166254d2c1a7_683x666.png" width="495" height="482.67935578330895" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ef7ca52c-3b89-4cba-b245-166254d2c1a7_683x666.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:666,&quot;width&quot;:683,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:495,&quot;bytes&quot;:515797,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef7ca52c-3b89-4cba-b245-166254d2c1a7_683x666.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef7ca52c-3b89-4cba-b245-166254d2c1a7_683x666.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef7ca52c-3b89-4cba-b245-166254d2c1a7_683x666.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef7ca52c-3b89-4cba-b245-166254d2c1a7_683x666.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Rendering of Vulcan.

It is the only vehicle in this lift class that was funded primarily through private investment, rather than government funding. New Glenn is an ambitious way to start an orbital launch program as it has a very large payload capacity, leverages high-performing cryogenic propellants in its engines, and is intended to be reusable from day one. It is for all of those reasons that New Glenn&#8217;s initial launch has been pushed back a number of times. Development began around 2012 and the vehicle&#8217;s first launch was intended to be around 2018, but that timing now seems more likely to be no earlier than 2023. New Glenn&#8217;s first stage uses seven BE-4 engines, the same powerful engines that Blue Origin is selling to ULA for use in its Vulcan Centaur vehicle. Both selling the engines and using them in New Glenn allows Blue to take advantage of scale effects on costs. It may also prove a challenge though as Blue has struggled to scale up the engine production rate and supply both ULA and its New Glenn with engines on the previously anticipated timelines.</p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F282d4e55-958b-42ad-a8f4-262f098daf8d_1497x1920.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F282d4e55-958b-42ad-a8f4-262f098daf8d_1497x1920.jpeg" width="398" height="510.3475274725275" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/282d4e55-958b-42ad-a8f4-262f098daf8d_1497x1920.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1867,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:398,&quot;bytes&quot;:171061,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F282d4e55-958b-42ad-a8f4-262f098daf8d_1497x1920.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F282d4e55-958b-42ad-a8f4-262f098daf8d_1497x1920.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F282d4e55-958b-42ad-a8f4-262f098daf8d_1497x1920.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F282d4e55-958b-42ad-a8f4-262f098daf8d_1497x1920.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Rendering of New Glenn rocket.

If we compare that pricing to say a Falcon 9 which typically lifts around 18,000kg to LEO for a price of about $60M, we can see that the rockets in the heavy-lift category are priced expensively. Which leads us to ask, why is that?</p><p>Well, the high cost of these rockets has typically been due to their applications. Rather than placing large numbers of satellites into low Earth orbit, heavy-lift class vehicles are typically used for lifting extremely high value, one-off pieces of equipment into higher orbits or to other planets. When your payload is an extremely expensive and unique piece of technology, like for example a giant NASA telescope that took a decade to build, customers are less price-sensitive and will pay more to make sure the launch has an extremely high likelihood of success.</p><p>Furthermore, while I used kilograms of payload to LEO as a way of comparing these rockets&#8217; lift capacities, they are almost never used to put satellites into LEO. Nearly every launch by these rockets is actually used to place payloads into a higher geostationary transfer orbit (GTO). In order to get payloads into higher orbits, they often use more sophisticated propellents. Rather than using room-temperature storable fuel like kerosene or RP-1, these higher-performing vehicles all use hydrogen (or methane in the case of New Glenn). Those fuels are gaseous at room temperature and so they must be kept at cryogenic temperatures to remain liquid in the rocket tanks. These cryogenic fuels have higher Specific Impulse (the rocket equivalent of miles per gallon) than kerosene, but result in more sophisticated engines. This in turn makes the rocket more complicated and expensive.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea58f0df-4465-4b6b-9757-7d36eb15710b_1775x1218.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea58f0df-4465-4b6b-9757-7d36eb15710b_1775x1218.png" width="1456" height="999" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ea58f0df-4465-4b6b-9757-7d36eb15710b_1775x1218.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:999,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:62960,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea58f0df-4465-4b6b-9757-7d36eb15710b_1775x1218.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea58f0df-4465-4b6b-9757-7d36eb15710b_1775x1218.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea58f0df-4465-4b6b-9757-7d36eb15710b_1775x1218.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea58f0df-4465-4b6b-9757-7d36eb15710b_1775x1218.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h1>How Are Newer Commercial Vehicles Affecting this Class of Rockets?</h1><p>As was mentioned previously, the rockets in the heavy-lift class have typically been developed in a separate manner (with government funding upfront) and with separate priorities (performance over price) than the vehicles that would be considered &#8220;commercial rockets&#8221;. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean that privately funded rockets aren&#8217;t having an impact on the heavy-lift category as well. Legacy rocket companies building larger rockets can no longer ignore the disparity in their launch prices compared to competitors. SpaceX&#8217;s Falcon 9 has created significant pricing pressure on the industry, with its pricing of around $60M. The next generation of heavy rockets built by legacy providers, such as the Vulcan Centaur (27,000kg to LEO) and the Ariane 6 (21,000 to LEO) will not lift significantly more payload than the vehicles they are replacing, but rather aim to be significantly more affordable.</p><p>In addition, customers are understandably reacting favorably to more affordable options. While SpaceX has already captured almost the entirety of the launch market for large commercial satellites, they are serving an increasing amount of the government launch business as well. In a recent National Security Space Launch contract awarded in 2020 for approximately 30-40 US government launches from 2022-2027, ULA won 60% of the launches and SpaceX 40%. While ULA maintains the majority of the US national security launch market, this is a significant change to the status quo as SpaceX only launched its first national security space mission in 2017. Furthermore, it seems likely that SpaceX&#8217;s market share of large national security payloads will only grow going forward.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Ultimately these heavy launch rockets are incredible pieces of high-performing technology that have typically operated in a class of their own, demanding extremely high prices. However, it seems like they are no longer able to insulate themselves from forces that are spreading through the launch market and it will be exciting to see how these companies try to adapt to remain competitive.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/heavy-lift?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/heavy-lift?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><h2>Additional Reading</h2><p>Liked this read?&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/IanVorbach">Follow me on Twitter</a>&nbsp;for more frequent updates on the space world.</p><p>Want to read more about the small rockets putting pricing pressure on the larger launch vehicles?&nbsp;<a href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/the-launch-landscape-small-rockets">Read more here</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Space Companies at Y Combinator]]></title><description><![CDATA[If you were interested in quantifying the rising interest in starting a space company, the accelerator program Y Combinator is probably as good an indicator as any.]]></description><link>https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/y-combinator</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/y-combinator</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Ian Vorbach]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 20:38:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92d5d8a1-d46a-4f93-81be-f6f7ec53f883_423x386.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/y-combinator?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/y-combinator?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>If you were interested in quantifying the rising interest in starting a space company, the accelerator program Y Combinator (YC) is probably as good an indicator as any. I attended YC&#8217;s demo day of their most recent Summer 2021 program. Out of  375 companies in that batch, five were focused on space applications. For comparison, no other batch has previously had more than one space company and most have had none. To put it simply, there seems to be more interest in starting a space company than ever before.</p><p>In this post, we&#8217;ll talk about the historical relationship between YC and space companies, what the recent batch of space companies are working on, and what it means for the space industry.</p><h1>What is Y Combinator?</h1><p>Y Combinator (YC) is a startup accelerator program founded in 2005. Twice every year they accept a batch of very early stage companies to attend a 12-week program which helps those organizations mature their businesses and prepare for fundraising. Startups that participate in YC also receive $125,000 of investment in exchange for a 7% ownership in the companies.</p><p>YC is the most successful accelerator program in the world, with highly successful alumni companies including Airbnb, Stripe, Coinbase, DoorDash, and many more. The organization has historically supported mostly software companies. However, there have been a fair number of successful hardware startups as well, including some sporadic space companies in recent years.</p><p>The most famous space companies to pass through YC are Relativity Space (Winter 2016 batch) and Momentus Space (Summer 2018 batch). Relativity has most recently been valued on the private market at a $4.2B valuation and Momentus recently went public via a SPAC at a $567M valuation.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h1>The Space Companies In YC&#8217;s Summer 2021 Batch</h1><h2>Inversion Space</h2><p><strong>Tagline</strong>: Low-cost return from space</p><p><strong>Website</strong>: https://www.inversionspace.com/</p><p>Inversion Space is offering low-cost services to return items from space to Earth.

In particular, nearly all of these organizations are providing some sort of &#8220;in-space service&#8221;. Only a couple of years ago, many of these businesses would have seemed far from viable in the near term. However, as launch access to space becomes a more &#8220;solved&#8221; problem, the industry is shifting more rapidly into considering what next-generation businesses can be built around activities that can be performed in space.</p><p>Another personal point of interest is that this batch contains a company that is building enterprise software to address problems in the space industry. As any industry matures and becomes more robust, it begins to develop a market demand for custom software solutions. While Epsilon 3&#8217;s software has applications to a broad range of hardware testing operations, the company at least in part represents a thesis that the space industry is now sophisticated enough to demand its own enterprise software products. This to me is an indication of a healthy point in the maturation of the space sector.</p><p>Beyond that, I think it&#8217;s also encouraging to simply see that this YC batch contains no launch companies given the saturation of organizations in that vertical.</p><h1>Liked This Read?</h1><p>Please share with friends:</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/y-combinator?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/y-combinator?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p>If you don&#8217;t already subscribe to SpaceDotBiz, you can do so here:</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Want to read about mature space startups that have gone on to reach public markets?

In fact, there is even precedent of international cooperation in space amongst seemingly adversarial nations, exemplified by the International Space Station where US Astronauts and Russian Cosmonauts have been cohabitating since 2000. So why couldn&#8217;t this be the same between the US and China?</p><p>Well, policy between China and the US, both inside and outside the space domain, makes any cooperative space campaigns seem unlikely. Once again the International Space Station provides an excellent illustration. In 2007, Chinese Vice Minister of Science and Technology Li Xueyong expressed interest in participating in the ISS, stating &#8220;this program has 16 countries currently involved and we hope to be the 17th partner.&#8221; However, the US has consistently vetoed China&#8217;s participation in the ISS and in 2011 banned NASA from working with China on any projects, citing potential national security concerns as well as worries regarding technology transfer.</p><p>Concern over technology transfer has originated not just from the US&#8217;s public sector, but from the private space world as well. In a Wired interview in 2012, SpaceX&#8217;s CEO Elon Musk cited China as the reason for not patenting its own technology.</p><blockquote><h4>&#8220;We have essentially no patents in SpaceX. If we published patents, it would be farcical, because the Chinese would just use them as a recipe book"<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a> -Elon Musk</h4></blockquote><p>Furthermore, it seems that China would like to leverage its growing capabilities in space as an argument for its role as the leader in science and engineering. A 2012 report by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission determined that policymakers in China &#8220;view space power as one aspect of a broad international competition in comprehensive national strength and science and technology.&#8221;</p><p>Overall, this is consistent with the broadening US approach of disentangling technology projects and exchanges with China which has only increased since the veto of China&#8217;s participation in the ISS back in 2011. Consequently, I think it&#8217;s fair to assume that the American and Chinese space exploration programs will remain separate for some time to come.</p><h1>How Is The US Government Reacting?</h1><p>US policymakers seem to be taking China&#8217;s rise in technical prominence increasingly seriously. One way this is exemplified is through the currently in-development US Innovation and Competition Act of 2021. While the bill has yet to move through the House of Representatives, it was passed by an overwhelming majority in the Senate 68-32 in a rare case of bipartisanship. Formally, the bill&#8217;s stated purpose is &#8220;the strengthening of U.S. leadership in critical technologies through basic research in key technology focus areas.&#8221;<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3">3</a> The bill&#8217;s goal more informally is in &#8220;challenging China&#8217;s efforts to displace the United States&#8221;<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4">4</a>, particularly in areas of emerging technologies.</p><p>If passed, the bill would mean a $250B investment toward science and innovation much of that funding going towards the National Science Foundation. In response, China has characterized the bill as &#8220;full of Cold War mentality.&#8221;</p><p>The growing focus on competitiveness with China seems to be one of the few things that US politicians are increasingly aligning on. While its unclear if space exploration will take a leading role in the rivalry between the US and China as it did between the US and the Soviet Union in the &#8217;60s, the contents of the Innovation and Competition Act of 2021 illustrate that at least a significant amount of the US government&#8217;s focus will be on the space industry.</p><p>To consider what political alignment toward investing in space might look like, perhaps we can look to the last time that there was such urgency resulting from competition around space leadership. This would have been in the &#8217;60s during the first space race. The below chart illustrates the NASA budget as a percentage of the US Federal Budget. It peaked in 1966 at 4.41% or $5.9B, which would be about $50B in 2021 dollars. This was the height of American efforts to compete with the Soviet space program and NASA spending has broadly been on a steady decline since then.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e19a5be-5e48-41b7-b531-00d9c4a100a7_1595x817.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e19a5be-5e48-41b7-b531-00d9c4a100a7_1595x817.png" width="1456" height="746" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1e19a5be-5e48-41b7-b531-00d9c4a100a7_1595x817.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:746,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:94769,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e19a5be-5e48-41b7-b531-00d9c4a100a7_1595x817.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e19a5be-5e48-41b7-b531-00d9c4a100a7_1595x817.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e19a5be-5e48-41b7-b531-00d9c4a100a7_1595x817.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e19a5be-5e48-41b7-b531-00d9c4a100a7_1595x817.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">NASA Budget as a % of Federal Budget from 1958 to 2017</figcaption></figure></div><h1>What Does This Have To Do With Private Space Companies?</h1><p>Even if you were convinced by this argument that the rising challenge from China&#8217;s space ambitions would lead to more political spending on space, why would that be relevant to commercial space companies?</p><p>Well, let&#8217;s consider back in the 1960s where the money from the Apollo program was spent. While the effort was undoubtedly led by NASA, NASA itself only employed about 33,000 federal employees in the mid-&#8217;60s. A much larger portion of the force supporting the Apollo program consisted of private contractors, about 377,000 individuals. NASA leveraged an army of highly skilled engineers and scientists in private companies around the US to meet the nation&#8217;s grand ambitions for the moon. Furthermore, if such an ambitious endeavor was embarked on today, I believe that the emphasis would be even more on private partners than it was during the Apollo program. </p><p>In recent years, NASA has only been increasing its collaboration with private space companies. In prior programs like Apollo or the Space Shuttle, NASA had often paid contractors to execute on technologies that the agency guided. Increasingly though, NASA is looking to simply pay for end services. An example of what this practically looks like can be seen in the recent Commercial Lunar Services Payload (CLPS) program. This program is meant to increase NASA&#8217;s capacity to perform research on the Moon. Previously, NASA might have designed a Moon rover themselves and paid contractors to build it. Instead, NASA informed private companies that it had payloads it wanted to get to the moon. NASA consequently had those companies compete to provide the service of delivering the payloads to the Lunar surface, however the companies best-thought fit.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92da91a2-64fe-49d7-b4db-a3b1cada6b72_1280x853.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92da91a2-64fe-49d7-b4db-a3b1cada6b72_1280x853.jpeg" width="583" height="388.51484375" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/92da91a2-64fe-49d7-b4db-a3b1cada6b72_1280x853.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:853,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:583,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;NASA Selects First Commercial Moon Landing Services for Artemis Program (47974872533).jpg&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="NASA Selects First Commercial Moon Landing Services for Artemis Program (47974872533).jpg" title="NASA Selects First Commercial Moon Landing Services for Artemis Program (47974872533).jpg" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92da91a2-64fe-49d7-b4db-a3b1cada6b72_1280x853.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92da91a2-64fe-49d7-b4db-a3b1cada6b72_1280x853.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92da91a2-64fe-49d7-b4db-a3b1cada6b72_1280x853.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92da91a2-64fe-49d7-b4db-a3b1cada6b72_1280x853.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Models of the first three commercial Moon landers selected for the CLPS program.

This has been most evident in the past decade through the Commercial Resupply Services contracts and the Commercial Crew Program in which NASA purchased rides from private companies for resupplying the ISS and for taking astronauts to the ISS. The benefit to NASA for relying more heavily on private services has been positive, with the most significant value coming from cost savings. A 2017 report out of NASA found &#8220;quantitatively that the Commercial  Resupply  Services (CRS) are significant advances in affordability by any measure&#8221;<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5">5</a>.

The US military branches of the Space Force and Air Force are doing so as well. Just in the past few years, the armed forces have instituted multiple programs and technology accelerators to increase coordination with entrepreneurs and private companies. These include AFWERX, the Defense Innovation Unit, the Space Rapid Capabilities Office, and others. These organizations have expressed interest in leveraging private partnerships in furthering all kinds of advanced space capabilities like on-orbit refueling, advanced propulsion systems, and rapid space-based delivery to anywhere on Earth&#8217;s surface. In addition, these organizations seek to partner not just with the larger, legacy companies that have been contracting with the defense sector for generations. The military is also working extensively with early-stage companies and startups that may not have always found ways to compete for contracts with the armed forces.</p><h1>What It All Means</h1><p>Ultimately I believe that in response to the growing competition from China in space, the US government and military will increase their investments into US space capabilities. Civilian government (NASA) and military efforts in space are increasingly being achieved through service-based partnerships with private US space companies. Consequently, it seems likely that the growing space competitiveness of China is going to bring significant new opportunities and funding to private companies that can help the US achieve its next generation of ambitious milestones beyond Earth.</p><p></p><p>Liked this post?

I highly encourage any students passionate about the commercial space industry to <a href="https://www.matthewisakowitzfellowship.org/">explore the fellowship</a> and apply for the current application process closing on October 29th.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.matthewisakowitzfellowship.org/apply&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Click Here to Apply!&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://www.matthewisakowitzfellowship.org/apply"><span>Click Here to Apply!</span></a></p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb028627c-1093-453b-a129-29e47071f9cd_1280x853.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb028627c-1093-453b-a129-29e47071f9cd_1280x853.png" width="1280" height="853" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b028627c-1093-453b-a129-29e47071f9cd_1280x853.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:853,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2060275,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb028627c-1093-453b-a129-29e47071f9cd_1280x853.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb028627c-1093-453b-a129-29e47071f9cd_1280x853.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb028627c-1093-453b-a129-29e47071f9cd_1280x853.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb028627c-1093-453b-a129-29e47071f9cd_1280x853.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Matt Fellows in 2019 meeting Elon Musk during a SpaceX tour</figcaption></figure></div><p>Now let&#8217;s start with the interview.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h4>You&#8217;ve held leadership roles on the public and private sides of the space world. Can you please share a bit about your background?</h4><p><strong>Steve</strong>: <em>Well, I&#8217;m an aerospace engineer by training, I&#8217;ve got both my Bachelor&#8217;s and Master&#8217;s at MIT. I&#8217;ve also had the good fortune of working in the public and private sector. On the public side I&#8217;ve worked at a number of agencies from NASA, the Department of Energy, and had a stint at the White House Office of Management and Budget where I had a chance to do science and technology budgeting.</em></p><p><em>On the private side I had a chance to work with a prime contractor and to work in the startup world, more recently having come from Virgin. Now I&#8217;m at something that&#8217;s a bit of a hybrid, which is a federally funded research and development center called the Aerospace Corporation. As a non-profit we work very closely with the government because we don&#8217;t compete with industry, we&#8217;re advising the government on the future of space from national security to civil. We also have a chance as a private company to go out and hire the best and brightest to have laboratories that try and solve the hardest problems that industry struggles with. So I&#8217;ve had a chance to do a little bit of everything.</em></p><h4>What role does the Aerospace Corporation play in the private space industry?</h4><p><strong>Steve</strong>: <em>So right now it&#8217;s a very exciting time in the space industry, it&#8217;s really unprecedented. In terms of the amount of change taking place it&#8217;s probably as much as the founding days of the space program in the 1950&#8217;s. On the national security side, that means we can&#8217;t be building these big exquisite satellites like we used to because of the threats that we are seeing particularly from what we call near peer competitors like China and Russia. So we&#8217;re going as close as you can get to the whiteboard in trying to think about what&#8217;s a better way to architect technology so that it&#8217;s survivable, can continue to grow, and can address the increasing threats that are out there. That&#8217;s for all sorts of new technologies and new commercial industries. It&#8217;s the same thing with our relationship with NASA, whether they&#8217;re going back to the moon and trying to find sustainable ways to get to the moon as well as developing low Earth orbit.</em></p><p><em>So Aerospace finds itself very involved in all of these communities in trying to work with the private sector and try to find those on-ramps, either for emerging space companies, or companies that aren&#8217;t space companies but have the kind of technology that can really advance efforts in space. As a non-profit, we can work with the companies and deal with their proprietary information in a way that&#8217;s protected and allows them to play a significant role with the US government</em> .</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b1bdeb2-7c19-45a1-8650-161ac711b3cf_640x427.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b1bdeb2-7c19-45a1-8650-161ac711b3cf_640x427.jpeg" width="640" height="427" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7b1bdeb2-7c19-45a1-8650-161ac711b3cf_640x427.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:427,&quot;width&quot;:640,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b1bdeb2-7c19-45a1-8650-161ac711b3cf_640x427.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b1bdeb2-7c19-45a1-8650-161ac711b3cf_640x427.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b1bdeb2-7c19-45a1-8650-161ac711b3cf_640x427.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b1bdeb2-7c19-45a1-8650-161ac711b3cf_640x427.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Aerospace headquarters in El Segundo, CA</figcaption></figure></div><h4>Your position provides a unique perspective into new technologies that will impact the space industry in the coming years. What innovations are you most looking forward to in the near future?</h4><p><strong>Steve</strong>: <em>There are so many that are out there, it&#8217;s like being in a candy store when it comes to technology. I think this is one of the many reasons why space is as exciting as it is now. We&#8217;re seeing the convergence of a lot of huge technological trends overlapping with the economics and the requirements of space. This goes anywhere from the fact that we&#8217;re seeing huge advances in IT systems, artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, and advanced materials. As well as new rocket propulsion systems, whether that&#8217;s new propellants like methane, or advanced propulsion like plasma and electric, to even nuclear propulsion. Another is 3D manufacturing and the things you can do with that from space. And even just a different way we can apply these things from space, in terms of being part of the internet of things and having global coverage. As we expand our presence around the moon and cis-lunar space, there&#8217;s an opportunity for these technologies to be applied there as well.</em></p><p><em>I think what&#8217;s really driving major changes is the economics, the cost of getting into space is a fraction of what it had been just a decade or two ago and with the proliferation of these launch vehicles at a more affordable price, it makes the cost of entry into the industry much lower than it has been. With these technologies that are continuing to drive down the cost, we&#8217;re seeing whole new players. You don&#8217;t have to be a long time contractor for the US government to be in the space business now. You can be students out of college, raising half a million or a million dollars, putting up a cubesat and before you know it you&#8217;ve demonstrated capabilities that others will follow and want to invest in.</em></p><h4>You served as President of Virgin Galactic from 2011 to 2016. Can you talk about how the private space world has changed since when you first started in that role.</h4><p><strong>Steve</strong>: <em>In 2011, while at Virgin I remember when Richard Branson said, &#8220;one of the things I&#8217;d like you to do is build a small launch vehicle to go after the small satellite business.&#8221; When he first mentioned it to me, I thought &#8220;that&#8217;s pretty audacious, I mean who besides governments really go out there and build their own rockets.&#8221; SpaceX had done it, but that still felt like a one-off at the time. But you know, you put your head down, physics is physics and so you start testing engines, testing tanks, putting together a team of folks that have come from either traditional aerospace or some of these emerging companies. And before you know it, you actually can do something that seemed ten or twenty years ago to be kind of impossible. We see now it&#8217;s not just that you have to be supported by billionaires, right now there are other companies that have been able to raise the money and through whole cloth have been able to develop these kinds of capabilities. So I think even things unimaginable just five or ten years ago are now in the realm of people being able to do them, so it&#8217;s exciting.</em></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bb266ff-ccda-4f9a-8866-4129894b0d64_1200x798.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bb266ff-ccda-4f9a-8866-4129894b0d64_1200x798.jpeg" width="554" height="368.41" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7bb266ff-ccda-4f9a-8866-4129894b0d64_1200x798.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:798,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:554,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Virgin Galactic Opens Rocket Plant to Build Satellite Launchers | Space&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Virgin Galactic Opens Rocket Plant to Build Satellite Launchers | Space" title="Virgin Galactic Opens Rocket Plant to Build Satellite Launchers | Space" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bb266ff-ccda-4f9a-8866-4129894b0d64_1200x798.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bb266ff-ccda-4f9a-8866-4129894b0d64_1200x798.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bb266ff-ccda-4f9a-8866-4129894b0d64_1200x798.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bb266ff-ccda-4f9a-8866-4129894b0d64_1200x798.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Steve discussing the LauncherOne launch system at the unveiling of Virgin Galactic&#8217;s new facility in 2015.

What do you think it means to have these startups now be available on public markets?</h4><p><strong>Steve</strong>: <em>Well you know what&#8217;s interesting is that even though the cost of space has gone down and you can get into the business with just a million dollars, that&#8217;s just to kickstart things. To really get into business, it&#8217;s still a pretty capital intensive industry. Even when you have a product that works, Elon Musk has said, sometimes the hardest work is still in front of you in terms of actually getting into production, developing those markets, and being able to get a return on that investment that will drive future investment.</em></p><p><em>This euphoria of investing in space, as well as other high technologies, has created an incredible source of capital. So we&#8217;re now finding companies, whether through SPAC&#8217;s or private investment, finding themselves raising unprecedented amounts of funding that frankly goes beyond what their near-term plans are. It has really given them the ability to think bigger in terms of what&#8217;s possible. Now some of these companies are only limited by their own imagination in terms of what can come next, as well as what markets to grow into organically or through acquisition, which I think might be the next phase of what we&#8217;ll see.</em></p><p><em>The real test will be whether we get the necessary returns. I think many believe that not all these companies are going to survive. There will be at some point a falling out, but that&#8217;s okay, like in any area of venture investment, you&#8217;re looking for a few big hits to be the ones that transform the industry and I think we&#8217;re seeing a few transformative ones coming to the forefront.</em></p><h4>What are some of the most pressing problems you see private space organizations trying to solve at this time?</h4><p><strong>Steve</strong>: <em>In many places, I think companies are coming up with novel ideas. So they&#8217;re trying to develop markets that in many cases haven&#8217;t yet proven themselves out. One example is proliferated LEO constellations. We will see whether or not they can achieve adequate returns. Those are very capital intensive markets to get the kind of coverage that you need and you also need to realize that you&#8217;re always competing against terrestrial alternatives as they&#8217;re developing quickly.</em></p><p><em>Some of the markets are frankly a bit oversubscribed in terms of supply. I think small launch is one of those. I think it&#8217;s been said that there are up to a hundred different companies trying to get into that business. I think right now there&#8217;s less than a dozen that have the capital to be serious and maybe half of that are likely to make a real go at it. In some markets we&#8217;re just going to see too much supply. And some businesses are dependent on other user markets developing as well. We&#8217;re looking at a large number of smaller satellites and some of the big questions are whether it&#8217;s better to have that market aggregated with bigger launch vehicles or as secondary payloads on those vehicles. Or is there really enough demand for paying a premium for these small launchers.</em></p><p><em>I think Earth observation is a really exciting area as well. As we push towards addressing issues of climate change, I think there&#8217;s a lot of growing potential. Another area is with companies that are exploring new wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum. It&#8217;s not just visible, its RF, synthetic aperture radar, and these others that until recently I think weren&#8217;t really thought of as having commercial markets.</em></p><p><em>In addition, other important markets will be in the development of cis-lunar space, as NASA expands out to the moon and determines whether to develop those technologies or buy services. Finally, there&#8217;s in-space services. Companies that can refuel, repair, clean up orbital debris, space situational awareness, and space traffic management. I think those are some really interesting ones.</em></p><p><em>So we&#8217;ll see how those applications play out to determine how truly big the market is and how many of these companies can it support.</em></p><h4>What do you think isn&#8217;t receiving enough attention in the space world right now?</h4><p><strong>Steve</strong>: <em>I personally would like to see more on the international front. I think it&#8217;s a great thing as more nations develop their own space programs because that leads to more responsible behavior. I do worry, with the proliferation of satellites, whether we are making space sustainable in the long run. There is the whole issue of space traffic management where lots of satellites are getting into closer proximity to each other. Or worse, the amount of orbital debris that&#8217;s left behind. We haven&#8217;t crossed any lines yet, but it doesn&#8217;t take much to do that if we&#8217;re not responsible. I think that involves international regulatory regime issues such as space traffic management, orbital debris, and issues dealing with spectrum. So whether it&#8217;s human spaceflight, safety of operations, or issues of liability, frankly I think there&#8217;s going to need to be some agreement in order to go forward on some of this stuff. I&#8217;d love to see more on the international front.</em></p><p><em>From the government side, I think there&#8217;s more work to be done on creating a market that&#8217;s better understood by the private sector, so the private sector knows where they can invest and can have the confidence that it won&#8217;t change for them. The government is trying to figure out how to be a good customer but at the same time knowing that they can depend on the private sector to step up. Something I think the government is always wary of is, will those companies that are hot today be there tomorrow? Can they depend on suppliers to avoid sourcing components from adversaries? Do those suppliers take matters like cybersecurity sufficiently seriously, will the information used within those services be protected? I think the government and industry are starting to work their way through it, but those issues certainly need to be tackled.</em></p><h4>The Matthew Isakowitz Fellowship Program is an organization you started for students looking to break into the commercial space industry. Can you please talk about that program and why you founded it?</h4><p><strong>Steve</strong>: <em>My family founded this program based upon my son Matthew who passed away too young, but in his life was an amazing force for change for something we all take for granted today, namely this exciting, emerging, commercial space industry. There was a time a little over ten years ago when victory was not assured, where there were a lot of naysayers who thought we shouldn&#8217;t be taking the risk of flying astronauts or payloads to the space station on these privately built vehicles. There were those who questioned efforts to go the moon that would involve commercial activity and who might have questioned whether the government should spend any money on these commercial ventures. There was the sense that it would be better if it was built in house at NASA centers or government labs, or with traditional contractors going forward. Frankly, there was the political atmosphere in Congress that tended to support those legacy efforts as opposed to new ways of doing business.</em></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9553a53-8fef-4bfa-b4fa-3aff83012b44_1059x850.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9553a53-8fef-4bfa-b4fa-3aff83012b44_1059x850.jpeg" width="574" height="460.7176581680831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d9553a53-8fef-4bfa-b4fa-3aff83012b44_1059x850.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:850,&quot;width&quot;:1059,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:574,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Matthew-Isakowitz-Fellowship-Program.jpg&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Matthew-Isakowitz-Fellowship-Program.jpg" title="Matthew-Isakowitz-Fellowship-Program.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9553a53-8fef-4bfa-b4fa-3aff83012b44_1059x850.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9553a53-8fef-4bfa-b4fa-3aff83012b44_1059x850.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9553a53-8fef-4bfa-b4fa-3aff83012b44_1059x850.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9553a53-8fef-4bfa-b4fa-3aff83012b44_1059x850.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Matthew Isakowitz on a zero-g flight.

SpaceX is planning to launch four private tourists into orbit around Earth, on a three day mission called Inspiration4. It will not be the first time a private citizen will go to space or even to orbit. However it will be the first time a private citizen is put up there by a private corporation. There have been seven previous orbital space tourists, but all were launched on rockets operated by the Russian government&#8217;s national space agency. The Inspiration4 mission will mark another major shift toward private organizations offering capabilities that were previously only feasible by governments.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50c325df-dbcc-4445-a8bb-5f41a3413ae4_3000x2000.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50c325df-dbcc-4445-a8bb-5f41a3413ae4_3000x2000.jpeg" width="581" height="387.46634615384613" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/50c325df-dbcc-4445-a8bb-5f41a3413ae4_3000x2000.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:581,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50c325df-dbcc-4445-a8bb-5f41a3413ae4_3000x2000.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50c325df-dbcc-4445-a8bb-5f41a3413ae4_3000x2000.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50c325df-dbcc-4445-a8bb-5f41a3413ae4_3000x2000.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50c325df-dbcc-4445-a8bb-5f41a3413ae4_3000x2000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">The Inspiration4 crew.

You can read that post <a href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/suborbital-space-tourism">here</a>. Orbital tourism though is a whole other beast. Putting humans into orbit is understood to be far more difficult than launching on a suborbital path to the edge of space. It is also a more profound experience for the individuals taking the ride.</p><p>In this post, we&#8217;ll talk about the infrastructure developing around private orbital space tourism. This includes the rocket companies getting the tourists up there, the private agencies brokering the experiences, and finally the habitats being built in space for tourists to visit.</p><p>Orbital space tourism is an exciting field that just a few years ago would have been considered reasonable only within the realms of science fiction. However it is becoming a very real way for private organizations to operate successful businesses.</p><h1>What is Orbital Space Tourism?</h1><p>Orbital space tourism means not just traveling to space, but doing so with enough sideways velocity that instead of falling back down to the Earth&#8217;s surface, you end up orbiting around the planet. Being in orbit means that a trip can last pretty much as long as you have life support systems that can keep you sustained in space. The first orbital tourist trips though are likely to last only a few days or weeks at the most.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ce2a2b0-c5b3-46f0-978c-ae9e21848041_800x534.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ce2a2b0-c5b3-46f0-978c-ae9e21848041_800x534.jpeg" width="447" height="298.3725" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3ce2a2b0-c5b3-46f0-978c-ae9e21848041_800x534.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:534,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:447,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Rocket Trajectory &#8212; why not straight up? | The Space Techie&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Rocket Trajectory &#8212; why not straight up? | The Space Techie" title="Rocket Trajectory &#8212; why not straight up? | The Space Techie" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ce2a2b0-c5b3-46f0-978c-ae9e21848041_800x534.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ce2a2b0-c5b3-46f0-978c-ae9e21848041_800x534.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ce2a2b0-c5b3-46f0-978c-ae9e21848041_800x534.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ce2a2b0-c5b3-46f0-978c-ae9e21848041_800x534.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Diagram of an orbital launch trajectory.

However, Starliner has had a number of technical challenges that have resulted in significant delays and so the capsule is unlikely to carry astronauts at least until the middle of 2022 at the earliest.</p><p>If Boeing does provide flights for private citizens aboard Starliner, it will likely be much more expensive than SpaceX&#8217;s services. When carrying astronauts to the ISS, SpaceX charges NASA $55M per seat while Boeing will charge $90M.</p><h1>The Brokers</h1><p>While the Inspiration4 trip was purchased by entrepreneur Jared Isaccman directly from SpaceX, there are also an increasing number of companies that will purchase the flights from the launch companies and sell seats to passengers directly. This gives the launch provider the benefit of not having to find customers and individually sell seats.</p><p>The oldest still active space tourism company is Space Adventures, which has been in operation since 1998. Space Adventures has actually been responsible for every orbital space tourism trip that has previously flown, all of which were aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket. The first Space Adventures tourist was American businessman Dennis Tito, who travelled to orbit back in 2001. Looking forward, Space Adventures has purchased one launch aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon and Falcon 9. That trip is anticipated for 2022 at the earliest and Space Adventures has not yet announced who the four passengers will be.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd027da2a-987b-4767-bfdf-277c42612a0f_800x534.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd027da2a-987b-4767-bfdf-277c42612a0f_800x534.jpeg" width="557" height="371.7975" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d027da2a-987b-4767-bfdf-277c42612a0f_800x534.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:534,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:557,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Dennis Tito, first space tourist - Stock Image - S565/0231 - Science Photo  Library&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Dennis Tito, first space tourist - Stock Image - S565/0231 - Science Photo  Library" title="Dennis Tito, first space tourist - Stock Image - S565/0231 - Science Photo  Library" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd027da2a-987b-4767-bfdf-277c42612a0f_800x534.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd027da2a-987b-4767-bfdf-277c42612a0f_800x534.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd027da2a-987b-4767-bfdf-277c42612a0f_800x534.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd027da2a-987b-4767-bfdf-277c42612a0f_800x534.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Dennis Tito aboard the ISS in 2001</figcaption></figure></div><p>In addition, to Space Adventures, Axiom is another space tourism company and seemingly has the most ambitious plans in the near term. Axiom was founded in 2016 and the company&#8217;s leadership has extensive experience in crewed space travel. One of the company&#8217;s founders served as NASA&#8217;s International Space Station Program Manager for 10 years. Axiom has already purchased four missions from SpaceX to send private tourists to the ISS and is reportedly charging $55M per seat to customers. The first of those, Ax-1, is scheduled for January 2022. Ax-1 will carry one former NASA Astronaut, who is also an Axiom employee, as spacecraft commander and three private individuals. Axiom has also confirmed reports that one of the first few missions will likely carry Tom Cruise and film director Doug Liman for the purposes of filming a movie on the ISS.</p><h1>The Habitats</h1><p>It&#8217;s possible to take a trip to orbit and remain in the capsule the entire time, as the crew of the Inspiration4 mission will be doing for their three day trip. However, for longer visits, it&#8217;s typically more convenient to stay in a larger, more permanent habitat in space that has more robust life support systems intended for extended stays. Currently, the only such habitat available to private citizens is the ISS. That is where most of the crews sent on missions organized by Axiom Space will be staying. The ISS though is a government operated scientific laboratory and was not developed with the primary intention of housing private tourists. Looking forward, there are a number of plans to establish permanent, private habitats in space that would be optimized for paying visitors.</p><p>The first and most obvious option for a private space station is to privatize the one that&#8217;s already there, the ISS. In fact, this is very likely to happen, although the timeline for that process is still unclear. In 2018, NASA released a document called the <em>ISS Transition Report</em>, in which it expressed that &#8220;NASA intends to begin shifting responsibility for meeting its needs and requirements in LEO by leveraging private industry capacity, innovation, and competitiveness that would offer the prospect of lower cost to the Government&#8221;. The ISS has guaranteed government funding through 2024 and there is significant confidence that this funding will be extended at least through 2028 and likely through 2030. At some point though, it&#8217;s highly likely that much of the ISS operations will be passed to private entities that will sell access to the station to those wishing to conduct research in space or visit as a destination.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c3f776e-fe17-4c59-8bbb-13d939d73ea9_985x657.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c3f776e-fe17-4c59-8bbb-13d939d73ea9_985x657.jpeg" width="673" height="448.8944162436548" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8c3f776e-fe17-4c59-8bbb-13d939d73ea9_985x657.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:657,&quot;width&quot;:985,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:673,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;International Space Station pictured above Earth&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="International Space Station pictured above Earth" title="International Space Station pictured above Earth" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c3f776e-fe17-4c59-8bbb-13d939d73ea9_985x657.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c3f776e-fe17-4c59-8bbb-13d939d73ea9_985x657.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c3f776e-fe17-4c59-8bbb-13d939d73ea9_985x657.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c3f776e-fe17-4c59-8bbb-13d939d73ea9_985x657.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">The International Space Station in low Earth orbit.

This is Axiom Space&#8217;s immediate strategy. Axiom is developing a module called the Axiom Hub, which will dock to an existing port on the ISS and expand the size of the station. Axiom is hoping that the extended modules will be added to the station in 2024, at which point they will not just broker trips to the ISS but will also host the tourists in their own private modules. Axiom ultimately aims to have its own separate private space station, independent of the ISS.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe84f99f3-2a74-47ac-99ee-7e6e7b26fdaf_1000x563.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe84f99f3-2a74-47ac-99ee-7e6e7b26fdaf_1000x563.jpeg" width="542" height="305.146" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e84f99f3-2a74-47ac-99ee-7e6e7b26fdaf_1000x563.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:563,&quot;width&quot;:1000,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:542,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Axiom Space Is Planning to Launch a Luxe Hotel in Space by 2024 &#8211; Robb  Report&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Axiom Space Is Planning to Launch a Luxe Hotel in Space by 2024 &#8211; Robb  Report" title="Axiom Space Is Planning to Launch a Luxe Hotel in Space by 2024 &#8211; Robb  Report" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe84f99f3-2a74-47ac-99ee-7e6e7b26fdaf_1000x563.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe84f99f3-2a74-47ac-99ee-7e6e7b26fdaf_1000x563.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe84f99f3-2a74-47ac-99ee-7e6e7b26fdaf_1000x563.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe84f99f3-2a74-47ac-99ee-7e6e7b26fdaf_1000x563.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Rendering of Axiom module added to ISS.

Some customers will prefer the shorter, less demanding suborbital trips while others will seek the prolonged, more ambitious orbital visits to space. Each has the potential to grow into a promising market opportunity for the companies involved.</p><p>Beyond the experiential differences though, another major distinction exists between orbital and suborbital space tourism. The price of an orbital visit to space is far higher than that of a suborbital visit. An orbital trip to the ISS booked with Axiom space aboard a Crew Dragon capsule costs about $55M per seat. With four passengers aboard, thats $220M in revenue to Axiom for a single trip. Of that amount, Axiom will have to pay significant costs to SpaceX and the ISS for launching and hosting the travelers. The cost to SpaceX alone is anticipated to be somewhere around $160M.</p><p>Compare that to the revenue involved in a Suborbital flight to space aboard a Virgin Galactic vehicle, where the price is expected to be $450,000 each. With six passengers on their next generation vehicle, the revenue per trip will be $2.7M. Consequently, Virgin Galactic has to fly about 60 times to match the sales to SpaceX of a single orbital tourist trip.</p><p>One of the biggest challenges that every space company understandably faces is scaling up its operations. SpaceX is currently flying its Falcon 9 rocket about 20 to 30 times per year while 3 to 4 of those launches will likely involve carrying NASA astronauts aboard its Crew Dragon capsule. It is unclear what rate of private tourist trips SpaceX is hoping to achieve, or even how many are possible given the limited space aboard the ISS. However, flying only a few private tourist launches a year can add hundreds of millions in revenue without adding too significant a burden to the company&#8217;s existing launch cadence.</p><p>On the other hand, the suborbital launch companies are looking to scale up from zero to dozens or hundreds of launches per year in the immediate future. Scaling operations has seemingly proved harder than anticipated for every launch program in the space industry, often with projects taking years longer than expected to hit launch rate milestones. It&#8217;s important to note that an orbital travel experience is significantly more complex than a suborbital one, so adding those flights will still be extremely complicated for SpaceX. That being said, it seems that SpaceX is benefited by the fact that the price of a single orbital trip is so high that they do not need to vastly scale their operations in order to add significant incremental revenue from orbital tourism.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>When the Inspiration4 mission becomes the first launch of private tourists to space by a private company, it will be a major moment not just for the space industry but for human exploration as a whole. It marks the beginning of a process that will hopefully lead to extended trips to space that are one day affordable to anybody and everybody. I believe we are fortunate to live at a time where this is now a reality and I&#8217;m excited for what lies ahead.</p><p>Also, if you&#8217;re unfamiliar with the Inspiration4 mission, I highly recommend the Netflix documentary <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81441273">Countdown: Inspiration4 Mission to Space</a>. The crew were selected for a number of criteria, but all have an inspiring story to share and it&#8217;s absolutely worth learning more about.</p><h1>Additional Reading</h1><p>Liked this read?&nbsp;Follow me on twitter&nbsp;for more frequent updates on the space world.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/IanVorbach&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Follow On Twitter&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://twitter.com/IanVorbach"><span>Follow On Twitter</span></a></p><p>And if this was shared to you, don&#8217;t forget to subscribe for more letters like this one!</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Space SPACs]]></title><description><![CDATA[SPAC your bags, we're going to space]]></description><link>https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/spacs</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/spacs</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Ian Vorbach]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 19:42:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5d9cbcd-5e02-4dd0-b921-4e6e59694c8a_1200x800.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Until fairly recently, there was really no opportunity for public investors to invest in the companies that would typically be categorized as belonging to the &#8220;New Space&#8221; industry.

Source: Bloomberg</figcaption></figure></div><p>By the end of this year there may be ten or more public space companies. In this post I&#8217;ll talk about the below topics regarding how SPACs are impacting the commercial space industry:</p><ul><li><p>What is a SPAC</p></li><li><p>What Space Companies have announced SPACs</p></li><li><p>What does it mean for the industry?</p></li></ul><h1>What is a SPAC</h1><p>Feel free to skip this section if this isn&#8217;t new to you.</p><p>A Special Purpose Acquisition Company (a.k.a. &#8220;SPAC&#8221;) is a publicly listed shell company whose sole purpose is to acquire, or merge with, an existing private company, thereby making the private company publicly listed. A SPAC is sometimes referred to as blank check company because until its management team (known as the &#8220;Sponsor&#8221;) finds a target to acquire, the SPAC itself has no commercial operations. You can think of a SPAC simply as a pile of investors&#8217; money sitting in a savings account that can only be accessed if the Sponsor finds a suitable target to acquire.</p><p>The majority of SPACs range between $100 million and $500 million with at least two percent of the funds coming from the Sponsor&#8217;s own money. This two percent is used to fund the Sponsor&#8217;s acquisition search and gives its team some financial &#8220;skin in the game.&#8221; After the Sponsor has secured committed investors, they take the SPAC (a.k.a. the pile of money) public via a traditional IPO. Once public, the Sponsor has two years to locate an acquisition target, otherwise the funds are returned to investors, and the Sponsor loses the two percent they personally invested. </p><p>Next, assuming the Sponsor finds a company interested in going public via their SPAC, they negotiate terms at which the SPAC will merge with the private company. The private company merges with the publicly listed SPAC and during this process the private company receives the SPAC&#8217;s cash and assumes the public listing status in exchange for an ownership stake in the combined business. Once the merger is complete the Sponsor relinquishes their remaining managerial control to the private company&#8217;s executives who will operate the newly public company.</p><p>After a SPAC merger is announced and before it closes, there are various regulatory and legal topics which must be addressed. The private company and SPAC file an S-4 document with the SEC to disclose to the public information about their history and future planning. Importantly, the SPAC&#8217;s shareholder must vote to approve the merger before the deal is closed. The time from announcement of the SPAC merger until closing of the business combination can be as short as three months but typically companies target four to six months for the process.</p><p>The SPAC process also often involves a Private Investment in Public Equity or PIPE. Think of the PIPE as additional capital for the deal that the Sponsor raises from institutional investors <em>after </em>locating a target to merge with. PIPE investors like this because they don&#8217;t have to tie their money up in the SPAC while the Sponsor seeks a target, yet they get to invest at the same terms as the SPAC investors before the newly combined business becomes publicly tradable. Raising a large PIPE also serves the SPAC because the PIPE investors are typically credible, long-term oriented institutions which can provide credibility to the terms of the merger and legitimacy of the newly public company.</p><h1>What Space Companies Have Announced SPACs?</h1><h2>Virgin Galactic</h2><p>SPAC Valuation: $1.5B</p><p>SPAC Capital Raised (including PIPE): $774M</p><p>SPAC date announced: 7/9/2019</p><p>SPAC Merger Closed: Yes</p><p>Virgin Galactic, founded in 2004 by Richard Branson, was the first space company to go public via a SPAC back in 2019. They provide suborbital space tourism by sending passengers on a trip up to the edge of space and back, with the mission &#8220;to be the spaceline for Earth&#8221;. The company merged in 2019 with Social Capital Hedosophia, a SPAC managed by high-profile investor Chamath Palihapitiya. The volatility that comes with being a publicly listed, multi-billion dollar, largely pre-revenue company is excellently exemplified with Virgin Galactic. When its SPAC merger completed in October 2019, the company was valued at around $1.4B.

Virgin&#8217;s June 11th high-profile launch of founder Richard Branson to space was a major event, signaling the organization&#8217;s plans to begin ferrying paying customers very soon.

This is particularly helpful if your satellite reaches space via a rideshare launch, in which you are dropped off in orbit alongside a number of other satellites hitching a ride on the same rocket. In that case, you may need to travel a bit further to reach your preferred orbit and a space tug will help get you there.  Momentus announced its SPAC in October 2020 at a $1.2B valuation but faced pushback from the US Department of Defense regarding ownership by its Russian founders, resulting in Momentus being unable attain the licenses to test its technology in space. The pressure resulted in Momentus&#8217;s delaying its tests by at least a year and the international owners divesting from the company. Following these challenges, the SPAC merger was revised to a post-merger enterprise value of $700M from the original $1.2B. Recently, Momentus reached a settlement of a $7M penalty with the SEC due to claims that the company and its former CEO misrepresented the readiness of its technology.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2bc97588-39bb-4fdc-970d-59cc63232820_3864x2404.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2bc97588-39bb-4fdc-970d-59cc63232820_3864x2404.jpeg" width="1456" height="906" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2bc97588-39bb-4fdc-970d-59cc63232820_3864x2404.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:906,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Momentus to go public through SPAC with near $1 billion valuation: Source&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Momentus to go public through SPAC with near $1 billion valuation: Source" title="Momentus to go public through SPAC with near $1 billion valuation: Source" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2bc97588-39bb-4fdc-970d-59cc63232820_3864x2404.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2bc97588-39bb-4fdc-970d-59cc63232820_3864x2404.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2bc97588-39bb-4fdc-970d-59cc63232820_3864x2404.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2bc97588-39bb-4fdc-970d-59cc63232820_3864x2404.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h2>Astra</h2><p>SPAC Valuation: $2.1B</p><p>SPAC Capital Raised (including PIPE): $489M</p><p>SPAC date announced: 2/2/2021</p><p>SPAC Merger Closed: Yes</p><p>Astra is building the smallest rocket coming to market in the near term.

The company has grand ambitions of launching rockets every single day by 2025, eventually at prices as low as $1M per launch (current launch costs are about $3.5M). Astra is already putting the SPAC capital to use and in June announced the acquisition of satellite electric propulsion company Apollo Fusion. The acquisition supports Astra&#8217;s efforts to build their own satellite system to vertically integrate both the launch and satellite development process for its customers.

One sensor function is radio occultation, which enables the satellites to gather atmospheric weather information by very precisely measuring how GPS signals are refracted as they travel through the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. This refraction is impacted by atmospheric effects that Spire collects and provides as weather data to its customers. The Lemur satellites also carry sensors to receive tracking information from sea-vessels and aircraft, allowing Spire to offer realtime maritime and aviation tracking.

On one side, private companies looking to operate in an extremely capital intensive industry (space projects are expensive) get to raise money from a whole new segment of the population that they would otherwise be excluded from. On the other side, public investors get to participate and benefit financially from the innovation taking place in an exciting new industry, instead of those financial benefits only being limited to accredited investors.</p><p>That being said, what I think is often said but not always fully appreciated is that SPAC&#8217;s do not face the same regulatory restrictions that are involved in going public through other means. A primary example of this is that SPAC&#8217;s are able to market to investors their projections for future performance in ways that companies are not allowed to do in a traditional IPO process. Being able to market to public equity investors on forward projections is a massive benefit for the company&#8217;s management. However it also means that a company can provide rosy projections to public investors who may not have clarity on how skeptical they should be of those outcomes. Consequently, there is additional burden on the investor to fully understand the risks of putting their money into these companies.</p><p>Furthermore, this benefit can become a double-edged sword. While offering mouthwatering projections that are 5+ years away sounds great, public investors will undoubtedly hold companies to their projections and any unexpected miss or delay can rapidly become painful to the stock price.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c19b5f4-77e0-46b5-883f-a7c9affbea35_1075x916.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c19b5f4-77e0-46b5-883f-a7c9affbea35_1075x916.png" width="546" height="465.2427906976744" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2c19b5f4-77e0-46b5-883f-a7c9affbea35_1075x916.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:916,&quot;width&quot;:1075,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:546,&quot;bytes&quot;:25309,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c19b5f4-77e0-46b5-883f-a7c9affbea35_1075x916.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c19b5f4-77e0-46b5-883f-a7c9affbea35_1075x916.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c19b5f4-77e0-46b5-883f-a7c9affbea35_1075x916.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c19b5f4-77e0-46b5-883f-a7c9affbea35_1075x916.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Additionally, once a sponsor has raised money for a SPAC, there is an intense financial incentive for them to find a private company to merge with. This is because if they don&#8217;t find one, they lose the approximately 2% of the funding they themselves put into the SPAC. As a result, even if an ideal private company was not found, there is a possibility that the SPAC&#8217;s leadership would move forward with a less-than-ideal merger anyway. As a result I believe that public investors should approach SPACs with increased scrutiny than they might towards companies going public via other means.</p><p>We have already started to see the early impact of the opacity of some of these SPAC&#8217;s exemplified through the recent troubles with Momentus. In fact, after Momentus and its merging SPAC were fined, the SEC chair Gary Gensler stated &#8220;This case illustrates risks inherent to SPAC transactions, as those who stand to earn significant profits from a SPAC merger may conduct inadequate due diligence and mislead investors.&#8221;</p><p>On the other hand, public investors who have owned Virgin Galactic shares since its SPAC merger closed in 2019 have seen an increase in their stock value of about 200% (at the time of this writing). Without a SPAC, Virgin Galactic may have struggled to raise the funding necessary to start scaling its launch operations and retail investors would have missed out on this upside.</p><p>The popularity of SPAC&#8217;s has skyrocketed in recent years and we have yet to settle into a new equilibrium so it&#8217;s unclear whether this disruption to traditional means of going public is temporary or more permanent. One thing SPAC&#8217;s have been able to illustrate is that there is significant interest in the space industry from public investors. At the time of this writing, Virgin Galactic was the 57th most highly traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange, despite not even being in the top 500 largest companies on the exchange.</p><p>While it&#8217;s too early to tell how all of this plays out, I think the genie is out of the bottle and we&#8217;re likely never going to return to a time when New Space companies aren&#8217;t accessible to public investors. It marks another new exciting milestone of wider approachability for the space industry and that trend of broader access and transparency is likely to benefit everyone involved.</p><h1>Additional Reading</h1><p>Liked this read?&nbsp;Follow me on twitter&nbsp;for more frequent updates on the space world.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/IanVorbach&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Follow On Twitter&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://twitter.com/IanVorbach"><span>Follow On Twitter</span></a></p><p>Want to read more about satellites?

Source: Viasat</figcaption></figure></div><p>The above diagram provides an illustration of how users can get online using satellites. A ground station connected to the internet beams information up at a satellite orbiting high above the Earth. That satellite then has a direct line of site to a user terminal (the dish antenna on the house) and the satellite transmits the information coming from the ground station back down to the user terminal. The user terminal is then connected to a modem and router which provide the information from the user terminal to your internet enabled devices. You can then send information back to the internet from your home devices by transmitting right back to the ground station through the satellite.</p><h2>Existing Satellite Broadband Options</h2><p>Broadband satellite internet actually already exists. The most popular provider right now is HughesNet. The HughesNet satellites are placed in Geostationary Orbit, which means they are far enough away that they orbit Earth once every 24 hours. This conveniently allows them to stay over the same spot on the Earth&#8217;s surface so that ground user antennas never have to change directions to keep pointing at the same HughesNet satellite, similar to your satellite television dishes.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1437b219-9a35-40e0-866b-b25e2c7da20c_715x415.gif"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1437b219-9a35-40e0-866b-b25e2c7da20c_715x415.gif" width="557" height="323.2937062937063" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1437b219-9a35-40e0-866b-b25e2c7da20c_715x415.gif&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:415,&quot;width&quot;:715,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:557,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Basics of Space Flight - Solar System Exploration: NASA Science&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Basics of Space Flight - Solar System Exploration: NASA Science" title="Basics of Space Flight - Solar System Exploration: NASA Science" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1437b219-9a35-40e0-866b-b25e2c7da20c_715x415.gif 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1437b219-9a35-40e0-866b-b25e2c7da20c_715x415.gif 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1437b219-9a35-40e0-866b-b25e2c7da20c_715x415.gif 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1437b219-9a35-40e0-866b-b25e2c7da20c_715x415.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Diagram of a satellite in geostationary orbit. Source: NASA</figcaption></figure></div><p>In the next sections we&#8217;ll talk about why companies are developing internet satellites in low Earth orbit, but before we do it&#8217;s worth noting that internet satellites in geostationary orbit aren&#8217;t necessarily going away anytime soon. There are even new entrants into that market. For example Astranis is a venture capital backed organization that has raised over $350M to provide more affordable and much higher bandwidth internet with geostationary satellites.</p><h2>The Development of Low Earth Orbit Satellite Internet Constellations</h2><p>A number of organizations are looking to improve the quality of satellite internet by bringing the satellites much closer to Earth, from geostationary orbit to low Earth orbit. The primary disadvantage to having internet satellites relatively far from Earth in geostationary orbits (about 35,000 km away) is that it takes .25 seconds to communicate with a HughesNet satellite and for the satellite to then connect back to servers down on Earth. That means that for your computer to get a response from the servers, it takes another .25 seconds, or .5 seconds total. For some applications like email or Netflix streaming that&#8217;s not a huge deal, but for others like playing video games where the user is rapidly responding to feedback from the internet, that delay is an issue.</p><p>For this reason and a few others, some organizations are working to provide that broadband internet service using satellites in low Earth orbit that are 1/35th the distance to geostationary orbit. Satellites in low Earth orbit travel around the Earth once every 90 minutes and since they are so much closer to Earth, each satellite only sees a small portion of the Earth&#8217;s surface at a time. As a result, you need a lot more satellites in low Earth orbit to be able to have global coverage, often hundreds or thousands of them.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f5e33-b1ab-446e-a743-03479d8e4630_224x224.gif"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f5e33-b1ab-446e-a743-03479d8e4630_224x224.gif" width="392" height="392" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/170f5e33-b1ab-446e-a743-03479d8e4630_224x224.gif&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:224,&quot;width&quot;:224,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:392,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;CIS 471: Will low-Earth orbit satellite Internet service providers succeed?&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="CIS 471: Will low-Earth orbit satellite Internet service providers succeed?" title="CIS 471: Will low-Earth orbit satellite Internet service providers succeed?" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f5e33-b1ab-446e-a743-03479d8e4630_224x224.gif 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f5e33-b1ab-446e-a743-03479d8e4630_224x224.gif 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f5e33-b1ab-446e-a743-03479d8e4630_224x224.gif 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f5e33-b1ab-446e-a743-03479d8e4630_224x224.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Animation of a low Earth orbit satellite constellation.

This requires a new type of antenna called a phased array antenna which directs its signal electronically rather than having to constantly be changing the direction the antenna is pointing.</p><h2>The Companies Competing in this Market</h2><h3><em>Starlink </em></h3><p>SpaceX&#8217;s Starlink is currently the most deployed of the low Earth orbit satellite constellations. SpaceX began launching its first prototype Starlink satellites back in February 2018. At the time of this writing, SpaceX has placed about 1,800 Starlink satellites into orbit and has expressed interest with the FCC for potentially up to 42,000 (although it is unclear if SpaceX really plans to use that many). Starlink initiated a paid beta program in November 2020 and SpaceX recently told the FCC that beta speeds are &#8220;exceeding&#8221; 100Mbps. The costs are $499 for the physical ground antenna that connects the user to the satellites and then a $99 per month subscription for the service. Furthermore, SpaceX has announced partnerships with Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud as the cloud computing partners for the Starlink network.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc8f35e3-ca6f-4144-9760-9eb9c1f6ca5a_1600x900.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc8f35e3-ca6f-4144-9760-9eb9c1f6ca5a_1600x900.png" width="534" height="300.375" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/dc8f35e3-ca6f-4144-9760-9eb9c1f6ca5a_1600x900.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:534,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;SpaceX: Starlink satellite internet service has over 10,000 users&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="SpaceX: Starlink satellite internet service has over 10,000 users" title="SpaceX: Starlink satellite internet service has over 10,000 users" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc8f35e3-ca6f-4144-9760-9eb9c1f6ca5a_1600x900.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc8f35e3-ca6f-4144-9760-9eb9c1f6ca5a_1600x900.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc8f35e3-ca6f-4144-9760-9eb9c1f6ca5a_1600x900.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc8f35e3-ca6f-4144-9760-9eb9c1f6ca5a_1600x900.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Starlink user terminal.

By not having to pay an outside organization for a ride to orbit, SpaceX&#8217;s costs are likely anywhere from $20M to $50M lower than its competitors for each launch (depending on which competitor you compare it to and what SpaceX&#8217;s margins are per launch). It probably takes at least 50 launches to deploy a constellation and potentially up to a few hundred. This translates to billions of dollars in cost savings for SpaceX. Furthermore, managing the launches in house means that SpaceX can get on a ride much more easily and quickly than others. In 2021 so far, SpaceX has launched a Starlink mission about once every other week, a blistering pace. All while still launching satellites for its commercial and government customers.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa5cdc61-9422-4a79-8957-7a2fce1b7826_421x707.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa5cdc61-9422-4a79-8957-7a2fce1b7826_421x707.jpeg" width="291" height="488.68646080760095" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fa5cdc61-9422-4a79-8957-7a2fce1b7826_421x707.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:707,&quot;width&quot;:421,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:291,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Musk says Starlink &#8220;economically viable&#8221; with around 1,000 satellites -  SpaceNews&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Musk says Starlink &#8220;economically viable&#8221; with around 1,000 satellites -  SpaceNews" title="Musk says Starlink &#8220;economically viable&#8221; with around 1,000 satellites -  SpaceNews" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa5cdc61-9422-4a79-8957-7a2fce1b7826_421x707.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa5cdc61-9422-4a79-8957-7a2fce1b7826_421x707.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa5cdc61-9422-4a79-8957-7a2fce1b7826_421x707.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa5cdc61-9422-4a79-8957-7a2fce1b7826_421x707.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">60 Starlink satellites stacked into a Falcon 9 rocket fairing before launch.

Source: telecompetitor</figcaption></figure></div><p>Telesat Lightspeed&#8217;s service will initially prioritize customers in Canada but the constellation will grow to global availability. Telesat has stated that they seek to target enterprise business customers whereas they expect other providers like Starlink and Project Kuiper to focus more towards consumer customers.</p><p>Telesat has also announced plans to be listed on the NASDAQ exchange sometime in 2021. The full Lightspeed constellation is projected to cost $5B for which the company will need to raise capital to develop.</p><h2>How Big Is This Market?</h2><p>As stated earlier, nearly 40% of the global population is still without access to the internet. To say though that this entire over 3 billion population is going to pay for a service that might require up to $500 in upfront user terminal costs and then potentially another $99 per month (this is SpaceX&#8217;s pricing, the other providers haven&#8217;t announced pricing yet) is obviously not a reality. However, while not everyone is going to be able to afford satellite internet immediately, there are likely many rural communities in nearly every nation that can afford it and would jump at the opportunity to pay for a premium broadband service.</p><p>In the US, according to the FCC&#8217;s 2020 <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-20-50A1.pdf">Broadband Deployment Report</a> about 30% of the rural populations or around 18 million Americans did not have access to broadband internet in 2018. With an average US household size of 2.54, that corresponds to about 7 million US households. If LEO internet providers can serve 10% of those households at $99/month, that comes to about $850M in yearly revenue. However, at these early stages it&#8217;s difficult to determine if anything like that 10% adoption rate is a reasonable assumption. There is also the likelihood that the satellite internet service providers will capture some segment of the approximately 126 million US households that already have access to broadband internet but are unsatisfied with their current service.</p><p>Beyond that, the US only accounts for about 5% of the global population. In fact the markets that seems to excite many of these companies are developing ones. For example one particular area of interest is in bringing online broader populations of the continent of Africa. Just as much of that continent skipped past landline technologies and went directly to cellular communications, maybe it is possible for much of Africa to skip laying millions of miles of high speed cable and instead go straight to satellite internet. A key caveat to that will be if these services can be made affordable. The ability of these companies to serve nations without existing high-quality low-latency broadband options is going to depend significantly on how much the providers can bring down prices as the services scale.</p><p>It&#8217;s important to also note that there are significant international regulatory challenges to overcome as well. These companies will need to negotiate ground station infrastructure in every nation they hope to serve and some governments might have concerns regarding taking consumer internet traffic outside of their country. Additionally, some nations might also be protective of their own domestic projects as well. China (which accounts for about 18% of the world&#8217;s population) recently announced plans for its own <a href="https://spacenews.com/china-is-developing-plans-for-a-13000-satellite-communications-megaconstellation/">13,000 satellite constellation</a> and its hard to imagine the Chinese government not wanting internet traffic to travel through that constellation rather than through one developed by a private western company.</p><p>Moreover, the traditional ground-based telecommunications providers are not sitting idly by while the LEO satellite constellations make their way to market. Internet global penetration seems to be growing at about 3% every year, so traditional internet providers are looking to sweep up that unserved market as well.</p><p>The LEO internet companies themselves claim the total market to be about $30-$40 billion and if those numbers are true, the upside is massive. SpaceX has recently stated that it has around 90,000 user terminals in their beta program in less than a year of operation. That would correspond to about $106M yearly recurring revenue and rising quickly.</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/thesheetztweetz/status/1422581531340595203?s=20&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;News &#8212; SpaceX continues to add Starlink subscribers, with the company \&quot;currently serving ~90,000 users in 12 countries.\&quot;\n\nThat's up from ~70,000 users in June. <a class=\&quot;tweet-url\&quot; href=\&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/03/spacex-starlink-satellite-internet-has-about-90000-users.html\&quot;>cnbc.com/2021/08/03/spa&#8230;</a> &quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;thesheetztweetz&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Michael Sheetz&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Tue Aug 03 15:34:02 +0000 2021&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[{&quot;img_url&quot;:&quot;https://pbs.substack.com/media/E74D0LDXIAUlw32.jpg&quot;,&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;https://t.co/rVdFLR6oPi&quot;,&quot;alt_text&quot;:null}],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:108,&quot;like_count&quot;:865,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null}"><a href="https://twitter.com/thesheetztweetz/status/1422581531340595203?s=20" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-user-avatar" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/twitter_name/w_36/thesheetztweetz.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @thesheetztweetz"><span class="tweet-author-name">Michael Sheetz </span><span class="tweet-author">@thesheetztweetz</span></div>News &#8212; SpaceX continues to add Starlink subscribers, with the company "currently serving ~90,000 users in 12 countries."

This includes vehicles capable of lifting between 2,000kg and 20,000kg to Low Earth Orbit. It&#8217;s a particularly interesting segment because it&#8217;s a highly international cohort of vehicles. It provides a great way to explore the international/geopolitical nature of the space industry and to consider the reasons for why nations choose to sponsor their own space programs.</p><p>The post will start with a survey of all the vehicles. Then we&#8217;ll focus on some of the patterns we see and discuss how we can think about the rockets in this payload lift class. The post will cover:</p><ul><li><p>Rockets in the medium lift class</p></li><li><p>Why are there so many state sponsored rocket programs?</p></li><li><p>Why do some nations take outside customers </p></li></ul><p>Notably, I&#8217;ve addressed vehicles that lift around 20,000kg to orbit and straddle the border between the medium and heavy categories in a previous post.

The rocket was actually developed in part through a partnership with a Ukrainian company Yuzhnoye Design Bureau, and the rocket&#8217;s first stage utilizes a Russian RD-181 engine. The US government funding was provided for the purposes of creating a launch vehicle to send supplies to the International Space Station while the Space Shuttle Program was winding down. Since its first flight in 2013, Antares has flown successfully 14 times. Each flight has been a cargo resupply mission to the International Space Station.

The price to customers of an Antares launch is estimated at around $80M.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15c6ab6a-00bd-4ff2-96f2-eeb6501a1207_435x250.gif"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15c6ab6a-00bd-4ff2-96f2-eeb6501a1207_435x250.gif" width="435" height="250" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/15c6ab6a-00bd-4ff2-96f2-eeb6501a1207_435x250.gif&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:250,&quot;width&quot;:435,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Antares Launch GIF | Gfycat&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Antares Launch GIF | Gfycat" title="Antares Launch GIF | Gfycat" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15c6ab6a-00bd-4ff2-96f2-eeb6501a1207_435x250.gif 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15c6ab6a-00bd-4ff2-96f2-eeb6501a1207_435x250.gif 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15c6ab6a-00bd-4ff2-96f2-eeb6501a1207_435x250.gif 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15c6ab6a-00bd-4ff2-96f2-eeb6501a1207_435x250.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Antares launch</figcaption></figure></div><div><hr></div><h2>Long March 3B</h2><p><strong>Originating Nation:</strong> China</p><p><strong>Originating Entity:</strong> China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, the primary state-owned launch provider of the Chinese government</p><p><strong>Payload Class:</strong> Medium- 11,500 kg max to LEO</p><p><strong>Maturity:</strong> Currently Flying</p><p>The Long March 3B is the most prolific vehicle in the Long March rocket family having flown successfully 68 times.

From the last flight of the Space Shuttle Program in 2011 through SpaceX&#8217;s first crewed flights in 2020, Soyuz was the only means for taking people up to the International Space Station. As a result, during that time the US was limited to buying seats on Soyuz-2 rockets for its astronauts to reach the ISS. Given its fairly competitive pricing at around $45M per launch for commercial launches, the Soyuz-2 has also been an attractive option for commercial entities looking to get their satellites to orbit. Soyuz-2 rockets carrying payloads for the Russian government are managed by Roscosmos. Alternatively, a European company Arianespace regularly purchases Soyuz-2 rockets from Roscosmos and contracts out launches for commercial customers.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F609385de-3798-48dc-9110-aba6ab71c582_444x250.gif"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F609385de-3798-48dc-9110-aba6ab71c582_444x250.gif" width="444" height="250" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/609385de-3798-48dc-9110-aba6ab71c582_444x250.gif&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:250,&quot;width&quot;:444,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Latest Soyuz GIFs | Gfycat&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Latest Soyuz GIFs | Gfycat" title="Latest Soyuz GIFs | Gfycat" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F609385de-3798-48dc-9110-aba6ab71c582_444x250.gif 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F609385de-3798-48dc-9110-aba6ab71c582_444x250.gif 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F609385de-3798-48dc-9110-aba6ab71c582_444x250.gif 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F609385de-3798-48dc-9110-aba6ab71c582_444x250.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Soyuz rocket launch.

One is for national prestige. Nations take great pride in having the capability to explore space and being a space-faring nation theoretically elevates a country into an elite group of technological powers.</p><p>A second reason is that a nation decides it&#8217;s worth the cost of developing their own launch vehicle in order to not have to pay other nations to get satellites into space. This decision is made either because they plan to launch so many satellites that the cost will be cheaper to make the rockets in house or because they don&#8217;t want their national security satellites leaving the country&#8217;s borders before going to space. So developing a launch vehicle can also be a demonstration of the ambitions of a country to have a more consistent presence in space.</p><p>In addition, most governments are secretive about the technology on their satellites because they are often leveraged for military or espionage purposes. If for example India were to pay China to launch an Indian military satellite into orbit, could India know that when the satellite was on Chinese soil, no one would peak under the hood?</p><h1>Why Do Some Nations Take Outside Customers </h1><p>Developing a rocket is a huge fixed cost investment. In addition, maintaining the launch program requires a continual re-investment that must be made every year a nation wants to maintain the launch capability. If a country is capable of recouping some of that investment by making money on the side and selling launches to private companies or other nations, then they are often happy to do so.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf329706-026b-4f9b-8b3b-4ce7b6f61167_760x515.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf329706-026b-4f9b-8b3b-4ce7b6f61167_760x515.png" width="760" height="515" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/df329706-026b-4f9b-8b3b-4ce7b6f61167_760x515.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:515,&quot;width&quot;:760,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:15315,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf329706-026b-4f9b-8b3b-4ce7b6f61167_760x515.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf329706-026b-4f9b-8b3b-4ce7b6f61167_760x515.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf329706-026b-4f9b-8b3b-4ce7b6f61167_760x515.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf329706-026b-4f9b-8b3b-4ce7b6f61167_760x515.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Medium Launch Vehicle Payload Cost Per Launch in Millions</figcaption></figure></div><p>In fact, this balance between government and commercial customers is an interesting theme that is pervasive throughout the space industry. In the case of state run launch programs, we see capabilities developed for the service of government customers, sometimes with the expectation or hope that commercial markets will materialize to expand revenue. However beyond state programs, it is also the case that private corporations operating in the space industry will typically develop capabilities that they hope to sell to both government and commercial customers as well.</p><p>Some projects are capable of straddling this line between government and commercial customers but it is often a difficult endeavor. If you pursue an area where the commercial customers don&#8217;t materialize, you can become fully reliant on government customers and the organization may take the shape of a traditional defense contractor (for better or worse). If you target commercial customers at the expense of government customers, you run the risk of missing out on meaningful and often reliable government contracting opportunities. In addition, in down markets the government tends to be more a recession proof customer than commercial customers which sometimes pull back on spending in rough times.</p><p>Furthermore, launching satellites for other countries can be a means of developing geopolitical relationships or an illustration of relationships that are already entrenched. For example, commercial payloads launched by China&#8217;s Long March 3B vehicle have originated typically from countries where China is aiming to further extend its influence, including Indonesia, Nigeria, and Pakistan.</p><p>Ultimately, we are currently seeing a transition of the space industry into a more commercially driven and privatized sector. However, there will likely always be  geopolitical and national security factors embedded in the space industry for as long as there are countries willing to vie for &#8220;the ultimate high ground&#8221;.</p><h2>Additional Reading</h2><p>Liked this read?&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/IanVorbach">Follow me on twitter</a>&nbsp;for more frequent updates on the space world.</p><p>Want to read more about the small rockets enabling some of this more affordable satellite launch?&nbsp;<a href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/the-launch-landscape-small-rockets">Read more here</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Rise of the Satellite Mega Constellation]]></title><description><![CDATA[Less and less space in space]]></description><link>https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-the-satellite-mega-constellation</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-the-satellite-mega-constellation</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Ian Vorbach]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 19:38:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd059ab02-5a03-42ec-a95e-e3f44cbae22b_613x599.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-the-satellite-mega-constellation?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-the-satellite-mega-constellation?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p>Ever wonder how many satellites are in space?

You can play around with it yourself <a href="https://platform.leolabs.space/visualization">here</a>. </p><p>The green objects are active satellites (currently numbering at over 3,000) and the purple ones are debris (estimates are at about 34,000 greater than 10cm in size and potentially hundreds of thousands of smaller ones).</p><p>The visualization actually makes the region around Earth seem more crowded than it is. In reality those dots are tiny, just a few meters across at most, and the space between them is massive, typically tens to hundreds of miles.</p><p>But in the coming years, it&#8217;s about to get a lot more crowded. Historically, a typical public or private organization would launch a handful of satellites to complete whatever business activity or mission it conducted in space. Increasingly though, organizations are choosing to meet their goals by launching dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of satellites into space in the form of satellite constellations. This has the potential to very much shift the dynamics of the space industry.</p><p>This post will address</p><ul><li><p>Why is space activity increasingly being conducted via constellations?</p></li><li><p>What challenges need to be addressed in a world dominated by constellations?</p></li><li><p>What are some of the companies looking to meet these new challenges?</p></li></ul><p>I think these are the kind of questions an investor should be asking in order to better understand what the future of the space industry will look like, so let&#8217;s consider them together.</p><h2>Why Use Constellations?</h2><p>To consider why space applications are being conducted via constellations, let&#8217;s look at a single application; satellite internet. The biggest provider of satellite broadband by market share is currently HughesNet which offers this service through a small number of big geostationary satellites that are really far away from earth. It&#8217;s nice to have the satellite in a geostationary orbit because at that further distance it can orbit earth more slowly, at the same rate the earth rotates. This means that it can stay over the same point on Earth all day and night. Also, when the satellite is far away it can see more of the Earth&#8217;s surface, so you need fewer satellites to cover the planet. What would happen though if you switch to using hundreds of satellites that are traveling in low earth orbit, much closer to the earth?</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc0f66dc-a96f-4107-8935-d4aed8ba2ff5_1314x498.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc0f66dc-a96f-4107-8935-d4aed8ba2ff5_1314x498.png" width="561" height="212.6164383561644" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bc0f66dc-a96f-4107-8935-d4aed8ba2ff5_1314x498.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:498,&quot;width&quot;:1314,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:561,&quot;bytes&quot;:167832,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc0f66dc-a96f-4107-8935-d4aed8ba2ff5_1314x498.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc0f66dc-a96f-4107-8935-d4aed8ba2ff5_1314x498.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc0f66dc-a96f-4107-8935-d4aed8ba2ff5_1314x498.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc0f66dc-a96f-4107-8935-d4aed8ba2ff5_1314x498.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Rough comparison of LEO and GEO orbital distances, not to exact scale.

Perfection is expensive.</p></li><li><p><strong>Proximity: </strong>Simply being closer to the Earth can make the satellite better at its function. A LEO satellite is less than 1,000km from the Earth&#8217;s surface whereas a GEO satellite is about 35,000km above the Earth. In communications that&#8217;s a round trip difference of about .25 seconds. While that might seem small, in the world of space-based broadband internet for example it prohibits major applications such as online video gaming.</p></li><li><p><strong>Low Cost Launch: </strong>This is less a benefit of satellite constellations and more an enabling factor. Up until ten years ago, a single rocket launch would often cost upwards of $100M. SpaceX was the first to change that paradigm in the last decade and newer launch companies entering the market in the coming years promise to further reduce launch costs. It can take dozens or even hundreds of launches to get a constellation into orbit, which until recently would have been considered impossibly expensive.</p></li></ul><h2>What becomes important in a world of satellite constellations?</h2><p>Moving towards constellations of satellites will have the impact of increasing the number of satellites by orders of magnitude. There are currently about 2,700 active satellites in space. The three largest internet broadband satellite projects are aiming to each add an additional up to 42,000 (SpaceX&#8217;s Starlink), 3,236 (Amazon&#8217;s Project Kuiper), and 650 (OneWeb).</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd02f2478-8478-4c5d-9e25-c8e87c80428a_720x405.gif"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd02f2478-8478-4c5d-9e25-c8e87c80428a_720x405.gif" width="508" height="285.75" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d02f2478-8478-4c5d-9e25-c8e87c80428a_720x405.gif&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:405,&quot;width&quot;:720,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:508,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Astronomers see SpaceX&amp;#39;s Starlink as an ominous sign of things to come -  Axios&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Astronomers see SpaceX&amp;#39;s Starlink as an ominous sign of things to come -  Axios" title="Astronomers see SpaceX&amp;#39;s Starlink as an ominous sign of things to come -  Axios" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd02f2478-8478-4c5d-9e25-c8e87c80428a_720x405.gif 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd02f2478-8478-4c5d-9e25-c8e87c80428a_720x405.gif 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd02f2478-8478-4c5d-9e25-c8e87c80428a_720x405.gif 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd02f2478-8478-4c5d-9e25-c8e87c80428a_720x405.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">A batch of 60 SpaceX Starlink satellites being deployed from a Falcon 9 rocket.

Once a satellite is launched into space, its important to immediately identify its location so that the satellite operator can begin sending up communications. Furthermore, atmospheric drag in lower orbits can cause the satellite&#8217;s orbit to change in hard to predict ways. As a result, the satellite&#8217;s location must be regularly reconfirmed to make sure it isn&#8217;t veering too close to an intersection with other spacecraft. This process of tracking orbiting spacecraft is typically conducted by using radar installations placed around the Earth.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65eaa575-e4c4-4e51-a34c-59bedb46b206_600x460.gif"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65eaa575-e4c4-4e51-a34c-59bedb46b206_600x460.gif" width="460" height="352.6666666666667" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/65eaa575-e4c4-4e51-a34c-59bedb46b206_600x460.gif&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:460,&quot;width&quot;:600,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:460,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65eaa575-e4c4-4e51-a34c-59bedb46b206_600x460.gif 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65eaa575-e4c4-4e51-a34c-59bedb46b206_600x460.gif 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65eaa575-e4c4-4e51-a34c-59bedb46b206_600x460.gif 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65eaa575-e4c4-4e51-a34c-59bedb46b206_600x460.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Visualization of potential Starlink constellation.

These operations are going to need to be made autonomous in a highly reliable way.</p></li><li><p><strong>Data Management:</strong> If a typical satellite imagery company used to have 15 satellites taking pictures of the Earth nonstop but in the future will have 150 satellites doing so, well that&#8217;s a lot more data being generated around the clock.

Less than an hour before the close encounter (calculated as a 1 in 600 probability of collision) the ESA diverted their satellite and any potential crisis was avoided. While everyone made it through this scenario unscathed, it&#8217;s indicative of what is likely to happen a lot more often in the near future.

I believe great businesses will be built solving these problems and I&#8217;ll be trying to keep an eye out for them along the way!</p><h2>Additional Reading</h2><p>Liked this read?&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/IanVorbach">Follow me on twitter</a>&nbsp;for more frequent updates on the space world.</p><p>Want to read more about the small rockets enabling some of this more affordable satellite launch? <a href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/the-launch-landscape-small-rockets">Read more here</a>.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-the-satellite-mega-constellation?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-the-satellite-mega-constellation?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Launch Landscape: Small Rockets]]></title><description><![CDATA[A small step for rockets, a giant leap for people into small rockets]]></description><link>https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/the-launch-landscape-small-rockets</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/the-launch-landscape-small-rockets</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Ian Vorbach]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jun 2021 18:09:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa696de04-a7e7-4a7a-a09c-f926686720f6_900x486.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Up until a few decades ago, satellites were all big.

The organization aims to make its launch infrastructure extremely lean, with the goal of being able to pack the launch equipment into a few shipping containers, ship it to its launch site, and launch the rocket with only six people on location. The company is located near the heart of the San Francisco Bay Area and tests its engines on a former naval base overlooking San Francisco (though no launches are conducted from there).

Electron has approached a launch cadence of once per month and is aiming to increase that rate by reusing their first stage boosters instead of building a new one with every launch. RocketLab aims to do this by catching the rocket&#8217;s first stage with a helicopter as it glides back to earth on a parachute (as seen below).

LauncherOne is a typical two stage rocket, but differs in what happens before its engine is lit. LauncherOne is first carried beneath the wing of a 747 aircraft (nicknamed Cosmic Girl) and dropped from about 35,000 ft. From there, its first stage engine ignites and points the rocket up towards space. The vehicle&#8217;s unique launch method makes it independent of complicated ground launch infrastructure. Furthermore, Cosmic Girl can take off from any runway, allowing LauncherOne to be extremely flexible about where it launches from. The dependency on an additional specialized vehicle however introduces another potential failure point. Any issues with Cosmic Girl would ground LauncherOne as well. On January 17th, 2021 LauncherOne reached orbit for the first time and is expected to have its next launch attempt in the coming months.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ebc7860-0540-41bb-b21e-d95630ad5bea_720x405.gif"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ebc7860-0540-41bb-b21e-d95630ad5bea_720x405.gif" width="560" height="315" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1ebc7860-0540-41bb-b21e-d95630ad5bea_720x405.gif&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:405,&quot;width&quot;:720,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:560,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Virgin Orbit to fly 11 satellites for NASA on second orbital launch demo  later this year | TechCrunch&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Virgin Orbit to fly 11 satellites for NASA on second orbital launch demo  later this year | TechCrunch" title="Virgin Orbit to fly 11 satellites for NASA on second orbital launch demo  later this year | TechCrunch" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ebc7860-0540-41bb-b21e-d95630ad5bea_720x405.gif 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ebc7860-0540-41bb-b21e-d95630ad5bea_720x405.gif 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ebc7860-0540-41bb-b21e-d95630ad5bea_720x405.gif 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ebc7860-0540-41bb-b21e-d95630ad5bea_720x405.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">LauncherOne lighting its engine after being dropped from Cosmic Girl</figcaption></figure></div><h3>Alpha</h3><p><strong>Organization</strong>: Firefly Aerospace</p><p><strong>Headquarters</strong>: Cedar Park, TX, United States</p><p><strong>Payload Capacity</strong>: 1,000 kg to LEO</p><p><strong>Maturity</strong>: In Development, first launch planned for summer 2021</p><p>Firefly&#8217;s Alpha may be the next rocket on this list to reach orbit, with its first orbital launch attempt planned for late June 2021.

The new ownership is Noosphere Ventures, an investment fund led by a Ukrainian investor. At $15M per launch, Alpha is currently projected as the most expensive rocket on this list, which may be due to the company&#8217;s plan to be the first small rocket capable of carrying at least 1,000 kg to reach orbit.

You can also hitch a ride on a bigger rocket thats taking a bunch of satellites up at the same time. In the launch business this is referred to as rideshare. This is akin to taking the bus and getting dropped off in your neighborhood whereas a dedicated small launch would be like taking an Uber right to your door. For some satellites, getting most of the way to your destination is good enough and the cost savings of rideshare are critical. Other small satellite companies need to get into space ASAP and have to be placed into a very particular orbit. For them, paying for a dedicated small launch is well worth the cost. Putting up to 200kg in orbit on a Falcon 9 rideshare launch would cost about $1M, compared to $7M on a RocketLab Electron, which can carry up to 300kg.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F480c7701-045a-40e6-944a-1ff6db00486a_484x320.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F480c7701-045a-40e6-944a-1ff6db00486a_484x320.png" width="460" height="304.1322314049587" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/480c7701-045a-40e6-944a-1ff6db00486a_484x320.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:320,&quot;width&quot;:484,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:460,&quot;bytes&quot;:250964,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F480c7701-045a-40e6-944a-1ff6db00486a_484x320.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F480c7701-045a-40e6-944a-1ff6db00486a_484x320.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F480c7701-045a-40e6-944a-1ff6db00486a_484x320.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F480c7701-045a-40e6-944a-1ff6db00486a_484x320.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Small satellites loaded onto a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on a rideshare mission </figcaption></figure></div><h2>Supply and Demand for Small Satellite Launch</h2><p>Ask anyone paying close attention and they&#8217;ll tell you that there are a large number of companies developing small launch vehicles. Some reports put the number at over 80. The number of credible programs is probably closer to one to two dozen and the ones reaching market in the nearest term are those I included in this post (admittedly this list is very US centric because it is targeted at US investors and there are some notable international players, primarily in China). Many believe that there isn&#8217;t enough demand to sustain this number of launch providers. In May 2020, Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck said himself &#8220;The market needs to grow a lot to sustain more than two companies.&#8221;</p><p>To better wrap my head around the market, I went through the 2020 calendar and counted every single satellite of less than 2,000kg launched into space. However, I excluded SpaceX&#8217;s Starlink satellites because those will likely be launched exclusively on SpaceX&#8217;s own rockets for the foreseeable future. In total, I counted 367. That seems pretty substantial. However, what about when you remove the OneWeb broadband internet satellites that were deployed on larger rockets 34 at a time and likely will be for the coming few years? There were 102 of these in 2020, bringing us down to 265. Then if you&#8217;re a US investor and want to quantify the market for the venture backed US based small launch vehicles on this list, its worth considering what the market looks like after removing the national security satellites originating from non-US nations that have their own domestic small launch providers and will likely launch on those rockets. Well thats another 69 and brings us down to 196.</p><p>So if 196 satellites launched in 2020 is reasonably indicative of the market size accessible to the US small launch providers, how many launches do we need to fulfill that demand? Maybe not as many as you&#8217;d think. In September 2020, a single Vega rocket launch carried 64 satellites to space. Even a small RocketLab Electron launch is capable of carrying a large number of satellites. In November 2020 an Electron launched 31 satellites at a time. Plus, rideshare launches on larger rockets seem to be growing in number as well. In January 2021, SpaceX launched 133 small satellites for commercial and government customers aboard a single Falcon 9 rocket. SpaceX has plans for a few of these rideshare launches every year, which could take market share away from the small launch providers.</p><p>So how many small launches are in fact needed per year? Demand can significantly fluctuate, but I would be fairly comfortable with anywhere from 6 to 30. With so many small launch vehicles coming to market in the coming year and some stating aspirational goals of one launch per week or even per day, this feels incongruous from the hundreds of launches per year that would be required to sustain all of the vehicles being developed.</p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F252be20f-b448-4a28-ab35-b9412e77d1c1_967x754.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F252be20f-b448-4a28-ab35-b9412e77d1c1_967x754.png" width="681" height="530.9968976215098" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/252be20f-b448-4a28-ab35-b9412e77d1c1_967x754.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:754,&quot;width&quot;:967,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:681,&quot;bytes&quot;:21095,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F252be20f-b448-4a28-ab35-b9412e77d1c1_967x754.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F252be20f-b448-4a28-ab35-b9412e77d1c1_967x754.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F252be20f-b448-4a28-ab35-b9412e77d1c1_967x754.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F252be20f-b448-4a28-ab35-b9412e77d1c1_967x754.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Small rocket launch prices in millions of dollars</figcaption></figure></div><h2>What Are the Small Launch Providers To Do?</h2><p>Well for one, they can hope the market expands, which actually isn&#8217;t a crazy idea to me. Maybe there were few launches in 2020 because there was a backlog of satellites waiting to be launched and once these new rockets hit the market, they will have plenty of waiting customers. Thats a real possibility and its what many of these companies are claiming. Astra CEO Chris Kemp recently stated &#8220;There&#8217;s a diverse and growing customer base for putting things into low-Earth orbit&#8230;Listen to customers, don&#8217;t listen to pundits and market analysts.&#8221; Fair enough (but also, ouch).</p><p>Furthermore, the applications of space-based data and infrastructure are multiplying by the day. Breakthrough technologies often achieve exponential growth and the emergence of mega-constellations of satellites has led to a significant rise in the number of satellites being launched. While those satellite constellations are typically deployed on larger rockets, there will likely be a trickle-down impact on demand for small launch as well.</p><p>However, if the demand for small launch doesn&#8217;t expand in the following years, how can an organization get ahead of those challenges? Some launch companies are looking at ways to capture more of the value chain. Consider RocketLab. With CEO Peter Beck being open about the oversupply of small launch, the company has begun targeting other opportunities to provide value to launch customers. For one, they&#8217;ve developed their own satellite bus Photon. With Photon, RocketLab can capture value that their customers would traditionally spend on third party satellite manufacturers. For example, an organization looking to take pictures of the Earth can simply tell RocketLab what they&#8217;re looking for and RocketLab can create the satellite to take the pictures, launch the satellite into orbit, and provide the customer with the requested imagery. A full end to end solution. In the past, the customer would have had to build and manage the satellite themselves.</p><p>RocketLab isn&#8217;t the only small launch provider looking to build new spacecraft products either. Astra has also demonstrated its interest in building satellite buses by acquiring a satellite propulsion company named Apollo Fusion. In addition, Firefly has won a contract to build a lunar lander to carry payload to the Moon&#8217;s surface for NASA.</p><h2>Cheap Launch for All?</h2><p>While the competition amongst small launch companies may be cutthroat for those organizations, the beneficiaries will be anyone paying to put a small satellite into space. Significant competition will push prices down for small launch and all the funding flowing into these companies might even result in temporarily subsidized launch prices. Just think of all the discounts from food delivery companies when huge investments were being made into DoorDash, Postmates, Grubhub, UberEats, etc. In fact, that very competition and resulting affordability in small launch will likely have a positive impact on the space ecosystem. As small launch costs get cheaper, we may find that new business cases make sense that previously would have been prohibitively expensive. Cheaper small launch may lead to the democratized access to space that we have been looking forward to for decades.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/the-launch-landscape-small-rockets/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/the-launch-landscape-small-rockets/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><h2>Additional Reading</h2><p>Liked this read? <a href="https://twitter.com/IanVorbach">Follow me on twitter</a> for more frequent updates on the space world.</p><p>Want to read more about rockets?

Well it&#8217;s significantly harder to get to orbit than just to reach space. In the space industry, a common unit for measuring the amount of speed you need to get somewhere is called delta-v. It simply means how much change (delta) in velocity (v) required to achieve a mission. A suborbital trajectory to the edge of space demands a delta-v of 1,400 meters/sec (3,132 mph) but to reach an orbital velocity you need a delta-v of around 7,800 m/s (17,400 mph), a much bigger challenge. Consequently, some organizations have decided to offer suborbital rides with the belief that demand exists for such a service.</p><p>There are two primary reasons why someone or some organization would pay for a suborbital trip to space, scientific research and space tourism.</p><p>With respect to the scientific value, some research organizations like NASA or university laboratories are interested in sending payloads up into reduced gravity or beyond the edges of our atmosphere. Since a suborbital trip can be as short as 10 minutes long, these experiments are intended to quickly take measurements under the conditions of weightlessness or reduced atmospheric density in order to learn from these experiences.</p><p>The second reason for suborbital rides to space, space tourism, exists because there is demand to join the small, elite group of individuals that call themselves astronauts. In addition, traveling to space is widely understood to have a profound impact on the passenger. As Astronaut Bob Behnken described looking back on the Earth from space &#8220;You see that it's a single planet with a shared atmosphere. It's our shared place in this universe. So I think that perspective, as we go through things like the pandemic or we see the challenges across our nation or across the world, we recognize that we all face them together.&#8221; Many are driven to space travel because of the sense of adventure, others want to live out their childhood dreams, and some are motivated by the exclusivity.</p><h3>Who&#8217;s Offering The Rides?</h3><p>At the moment there are two competitors in the race toward suborbital space tourism, Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin.</p><h4>Virgin Galactic</h4><p>Virgin Galactic is a publicly traded company ($SPCE) that for nearly two decades was primarily privately funded by Richard Branson and in 2019 became available to public investors through a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC)</p><p>Virgin&#8217;s technical approach involves two separate vehicles, its spacecraft named SpaceShipTwo that goes to space and its carrier airplane named White Knight Two that carries SpaceShipTwo for the first part of the ride.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6939436-4a89-4797-9f2a-1575c913befe_281x179.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6939436-4a89-4797-9f2a-1575c913befe_281x179.jpeg" width="281" height="179" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e6939436-4a89-4797-9f2a-1575c913befe_281x179.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:179,&quot;width&quot;:281,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;SpaceShipTwo - Wikipedia&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="SpaceShipTwo - Wikipedia" title="SpaceShipTwo - Wikipedia" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6939436-4a89-4797-9f2a-1575c913befe_281x179.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6939436-4a89-4797-9f2a-1575c913befe_281x179.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6939436-4a89-4797-9f2a-1575c913befe_281x179.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6939436-4a89-4797-9f2a-1575c913befe_281x179.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">SpaceShipTwo attached below center of White Knight Two</figcaption></figure></div><p>The ride involves White Knight Two taking off from a runway with SpaceShipTwo attached below.

That being said, it has been a highly unique approach and for that reason Virgin has had to solve a number of problems for the first time rather than utilizing more well-understood rocketry methodologies. The road has been undeniably long and rocky for Virgin, with original predictions for the first commercial customers in the early 2010&#8217;s. Virgin is nearing that milestone and now aims to launch its first commercial customers in 2021.</p><h4>Blue Origin</h4><p>Blue Origin is a private company, entirely funded and owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.</p><p>Blue has taken a more traditional approach to suborbital flight, launching a rocket straight up and then having it fall right back down. Blue utilizes their New Shepard launch vehicle to accomplish this task. The vehicle is named after Alan Shepard, who became the first American to go to space which took place on a suborbital flight in 1961.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6cb4996f-89dd-4dcc-bd5a-b476684e8c41_1280x720.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6cb4996f-89dd-4dcc-bd5a-b476684e8c41_1280x720.jpeg" width="489" height="275.0625" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6cb4996f-89dd-4dcc-bd5a-b476684e8c41_1280x720.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:720,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:489,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Blue Origin NS-12 New Shepard Rocket Flight and Landing - YouTube&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Blue Origin NS-12 New Shepard Rocket Flight and Landing - YouTube" title="Blue Origin NS-12 New Shepard Rocket Flight and Landing - YouTube" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6cb4996f-89dd-4dcc-bd5a-b476684e8c41_1280x720.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6cb4996f-89dd-4dcc-bd5a-b476684e8c41_1280x720.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6cb4996f-89dd-4dcc-bd5a-b476684e8c41_1280x720.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6cb4996f-89dd-4dcc-bd5a-b476684e8c41_1280x720.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">New Shepard lifting off from launch pad </figcaption></figure></div><p> The vehicle has two major components, the booster stage carrying the engines and propellents for lifting the vehicle into space and the crew capsule which holds the passengers.

This is a challenging question to ask for a service that hasn&#8217;t yet been offered. Virgin Galactic has already reserved seats at a cost of $250,000 per ticket, with indications that the price will rise closer to $400,000 in the future. Virgin Galactic&#8217;s next generation vehicle (SpaceShip III) will have room for six passengers per flight, meaning that at $250K per seat they are anticipating revenues of approximately $1.5 million per launch. Virgin Galactic has stated that they have limited their waitlist to 600 individuals, so that they have a $150M backlog of passengers.</p><p>If that $150M backlog quickly expands once the waitlist is opened, then its understandable why so many are excited about Virgin Galactic&#8217;s ambitions. The CEO Michael Colgazer has stated plans for $1B in revenue per year at scale and hopes to fly 400 times per year per spaceport, with plans for multiple spaceports across the globe. However a key question is, how long will it take for Virgin to get up to that launch cadence? Currently, Virgin has yet to launch their first commercial passengers and their shortest time between test flights has been about four months. Four months between launches would mean three launches per year, corresponding to $4.5M in annual revenue. Some analysts are very skeptical of the launch rates suggested by the company.</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/LauraForczyk/status/1356293934067101704?s=20&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Morgan Stanley needs better space analysts.

The first seat on that flight is currently being auctioned off, however, Blue has yet to announce their price per seat for regular flights. Blue has also not demonstrated a flight cadence of more than a few test launches a year at most. However, just as with Virgin, it is unclear what rate Blue is capable of achieving as they move toward more commercial launches. Bezos has invested billions of dollars into Blue, which is tackling multiple projects beyond just New Shepard. As a result it is unclear how many dozens or hundreds of launches would be necessary to provide a positive return on that investment.</p><p>Another factor impacting the market available to these competitors is that they are potentially both trying to serve the same pool of customers. For that reason, whoever makes it to market last or is unable to scale their launch rates quickly enough may find  their list of potential customers decreasing as the other suborbital provider fulfills the market demand.</p><p>One more critical consideration to this market is that orbital tourism is coming to fruition in the near future as well. SpaceX has already matured flying astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) for government customers including NASA and Japan&#8217;s Space Agency. They&#8217;ve recently signed on their first few private flights with the earliest currently planned for September 2021. While orbital space tourism will be significantly more expensive than suborbital, its also true that the experience will likely be more substantial.

There are four major payload classes, Small Lift (rockets that can send payloads of 2,000kg and below into orbit), Medium Lift (2,000kg to 20,000kg), Heavy Lift (20,000kg to 50,000kg) and Super Heavy Lift (above 50,000kg).</p><p>I have chosen to start with a post about rockets that exist at the edge of the Medium/Heavy Lift payload classes (around 18,000kg-24,000kg to LEO) because these are arguably the most high profile rockets actively flying today.

This is partly because of its technical achievements and partly because of how it represents an emergence of &#8220;NewSpace&#8221; commercial entities disrupting an industry previously dominated by legacy players. The Falcon 9 has effectively positioned itself as the industry&#8217;s versatile workhorse launch vehicle. It was built not to push the limits of rocket technology or solely serve a government&#8217;s mission priorities but instead was maybe the first rocket program developed largely with private investment for the purpose of launching reliably and affordably. When SpaceX introduced the Falcon 9, it was the lowest priced launch vehicle in its payload category and created significant downward pricing pressure which has had widespread impacts through the industry. Currently the price of a Falcon 9 is around $62M. In 2015, SpaceX became the first entity to land a rocket, a massive technical feat considered nearly impossible up until the moment SpaceX accomplished it. However this leap was made not to demonstrate their technical ingenuity but instead to increase profits by reducing costs and increasing flight cadence through reusing the rocket&#8217;s first stage.</p><p>After their first landing, SpaceX released a compilation of all of their unsuccessful attempts, a demonstration of the company embracing its failures in a way that is rare for space companies. The video is a fun watch and highly recommended:</p><div id="youtube2-bvim4rsNHkQ" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;bvim4rsNHkQ&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bvim4rsNHkQ?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><div><hr></div><h4>Atlas V</h4><p><strong>Originating Nation:</strong>&nbsp;United States</p><p><strong>Originating Entity:</strong>&nbsp;United Launch Alliance (ULA), a US company that is a 50/50 partnership between Boeing and Lockheed Martin</p><p><strong>Payload Class:</strong>&nbsp;Medium/Heavy- 20,520 kg max to LEO</p><p><strong>Maturity:&nbsp;</strong>Currently Flying</p><p>Atlas V is the oldest actively flying rocket on US soil, with its first flight in 2002. It has been regularly and reliably flying since and has launched 85 times. Unlike the Falcon 9, the Atlas V was designed a bit more with performance in mind and as a result is a more expensive launch vehicle. Whereas the Falcon 9 specializes in frequent low cost launches to Low Earth Orbit, the Atlas V leverages its higher performance (as measured in Specific Impulse, the rocket equivalent of miles per gallon) to reach further destinations such as Geosynchronous Orbits. These orbits are typically more used by government satellites (such as GPS, spy imaging, or classified communications) and so the Atlas V has traditionally been the go-to rocket for less price sensitive US government national security satellite launches that must be launched from US soil. However, an Atlas V launch costs about $110M per launch and so the Falcon 9 has been steadily eating into the Atlas V&#8217;s business as the Falcon 9 has proven its reliability and the US government has found the cost savings to American taxpayers to be increasingly attractive. A further complication for the Atlas V is that its first stage engine, the RD-180, is purchased by ULA from Russia and in 2014 Congress mandated that the US end its dependence on Russian engines. Thus the Atlas V is being phased out of active use in the coming years. ULA plans to replace it with its more powerful next generation launch vehicle, Vulcan.</p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0769c71-0b1c-4f71-80e8-9adfa5231ad0_573x515.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0769c71-0b1c-4f71-80e8-9adfa5231ad0_573x515.png" width="573" height="515" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a0769c71-0b1c-4f71-80e8-9adfa5231ad0_573x515.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:515,&quot;width&quot;:573,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:11055,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0769c71-0b1c-4f71-80e8-9adfa5231ad0_573x515.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0769c71-0b1c-4f71-80e8-9adfa5231ad0_573x515.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0769c71-0b1c-4f71-80e8-9adfa5231ad0_573x515.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0769c71-0b1c-4f71-80e8-9adfa5231ad0_573x515.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Medium/Heavy Lift Launch Vehicles by Price Per Launch</figcaption></figure></div><p></p><h4>Proton</h4><h4></h4><p><strong>Originating Nation:</strong>&nbsp;Russia</p><p><strong>Originating Entity:</strong>&nbsp;Designed by Khrunischev State Research and Production Space Center, an entity of the Russian Government</p><p><strong>Payload Class:</strong>&nbsp;Medium/Heavy- 23,700 kg max to LEO</p><p><strong>Maturity</strong>: Currently Flying</p><p>The proton is one of the most successful and prolific rockets in the history of spaceflight.

For example, while one of the most significant drivers of vehicle success is price, the Atlas V still flew five times in 2020 despite costing over $100M per launch and being nearly twice the cost of a Falcon 9. In addition, the Proton rocket continues to fly regularly both for the Russian government as well as European and Russian commercial entities. Why hasn&#8217;t this become a winner take all sector? Beyond price, some of the major factors that drive competitiveness include reliability, performance, national security, geography, and (critically) politics.</p><p>Throughout the history of rocketry, reliability has proven to be a major priority. Given the high cost of failure if a satellite is destroyed during launch as well as the high cost of insuring satellites that launch on unreliable rockets, a reliable track record is a strong competitive advantage. In fact reliability was the primary argument that ULA made for discouraging the US government from using the Falcon 9 rocket during SpaceX&#8217;s infancy. At this point however, the Falcon 9 has flown so frequently that it is arguably the most reliable rocket available today in addition to being the most cost effective.</p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80f1411b-2104-4d6e-895b-72302c189489_573x515.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80f1411b-2104-4d6e-895b-72302c189489_573x515.png" width="573" height="515" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/80f1411b-2104-4d6e-895b-72302c189489_573x515.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:515,&quot;width&quot;:573,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:9411,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80f1411b-2104-4d6e-895b-72302c189489_573x515.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80f1411b-2104-4d6e-895b-72302c189489_573x515.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80f1411b-2104-4d6e-895b-72302c189489_573x515.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80f1411b-2104-4d6e-895b-72302c189489_573x515.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Number of Successful Launches by Medium/Heavy Lift Launch Vehicles</figcaption></figure></div><p></p><p>Performance has also become a competitive differentiator. As stated earlier, the Atlas V utilizes engines that provide higher in-space performance which optimizes them for further orbits. While these further orbits (such as Geosynchronous Orbit) are just a sub-segment of the broader launch market, ULA has found this segment to be highly attractive and one they hope to protect.</p><p>In addition, national security continues to be one of the primary reasons that some launch vehicles exist. As long as a nation is flying military and national security satellites, they will desire that those satellites stay within their own nation&#8217;s borders until the time of launch. For that reason, rockets like Proton will always have the Russian government as a reliable customer and rockets from other nations will never be able to compete for those launches. It is also worth noting that national security government launches tend to be much more lucrative than commercial launches. For example, while ULA may make $110M on a commercial Atlas V launch, it takes in closer to $180M on launches for government customers due to the increased services and specifications needed to satisfy national security customers. It is this reason why ULA is so focused on competing for national security launches while SpaceX dominates commercial launches in the US. </p><p>Beyond national security, we can also see that geography has proven to be a competitive advantage as well. While SpaceX has in many ways become the preferred launch vehicle for US commercial satellites, the Proton rocket (which is slightly more expensive) continues to fly payloads for Russian and European commercial entities that also have freedom to choose their launch provider. It seems that satellite operators have a preference for using rockets that are built and launched from close to home.</p><p>Finally, perhaps one of the primary factors that has not been discussed yet is the highly political nature of the space industry. The US legacy defense companies have extremely effective lobbying arms and have also strategically positioned their manufacturing facilities to be located in the districts of highly influential politicians. While its nearly impossible to quantify the true impact of this under-the-radar dealmaking, these lobbying efforts are widely understood to be a major factor in the decision making for major launch contracts offered by government entities.</p><p>Ultimately the various factors contributing to competitiveness in the industry have prevented any single launch provider from owning the entirety of the market which makes it an exciting and continually evolving part of the space industry. That being said there is significant disruption taking place that makes this an interesting sector for investors to pay close attention to.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[An investor's approach to the space industry]]></title><description><![CDATA[or: How to hopefully not lose money while exploring the universe]]></description><link>https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/coming-soon</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://spacedotbiz.substack.com/p/coming-soon</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Ian Vorbach]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2020 22:15:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/dd75e89d-224d-43dc-b8e5-6763cc25845b_1536x1024.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to SpaceDotBiz by me, Ian Vorbach. </p><p>I believe the emerging space economy provides a rare opportunity to tap into humanity&#8217;s innate desire for exploration while also benefiting economically.</p><p>Why am I qualified to talk about this?
