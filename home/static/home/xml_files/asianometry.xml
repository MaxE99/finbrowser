Not because the countries host big semiconductor fabs, but because Ukraine is the world's leading supplier of neon gas. </p><p>Neon gas is a critical material for the production of certain chips. </p><p>And this has led to renewed concerns about another chip shortage. </p><p>I have been asked to review the topic. In this brief video, we are going to take a look at how fabs use and conserve neon in the semiconductor manufacturing process. </p><h2>Neon </h2><p>Neon is a noble gas. It is found naturally in the air at very low concentrations - roughly at levels of 18.2 parts per million. At high purity, it is colorless, odorless, and inert. </p><p>Neon is most well known for its characteristic glowing signs. I remember being in Hong Kong and seeing them everywhere. All of these signs are referred to as "neon", but they actually use a variety of different noble gases to generate a range of colors. Legitimate neon signs have a reddish orange hue. </p><p>The gas has large industrial uses in vacuum tubes, aerospace, chemistry and cryogenics. In space, it is a vital coolant for infrared imaging systems. They are also used in the manufacture of OLED flat panel displays. </p><h2>Producing Neon </h2><p>Industrially, neon and other inert gases are cryogenically taken out of the air in large, multi-million dollar facilities called Air Separation Plants or ASUs. </p><p>These plants are actually set up to extract and deliver oxygen to chemical and metallurgical facilities. The neon gas extraction is a by-product of the process. </p><p>As ASUs pull oxygen out of the air, they are also accumulating crude mixtures of Neon and Helium, referred to as NHM. This NHM interferes with the facility's main job and must be removed. But the NHM can also be purified and separated into pure Neon and Helium with some extra work. </p><p>The process was pioneered by the French chemist and inventor Georges Claude - the Edison of France. He produced these various rarefied gas byproducts while liquefying air, and first commercialized neon lighting while searching for use cases for them. </p><p>His work would eventually lead to the foundation of Air Liquide, today a $60 billion dollar company. </p><p>Only the largest of ASUs find it economically viable to do the extra work to purify these gases. It costs a lot of energy to raise the purity level from 30-40% to the 99.999 whatever percent to make them suitable for industrial use. So mostly these gas byproducts are just vented out into the wilderness. </p><h2>Neon in the Semiconductor Process </h2><p>The world's leading use of neon is not for lighting, but rather photolithography in the semiconductor manufacturing process. It takes up 70% of global neon production and is the fastest growing market for the $20 billion industry.  </p><p>Neon is a critical material for excimer lasers used in steppers for DUV lithography like the 193 nanometer Argon Fluoride excimer laser. </p><p>Along with its older sibling Krypton Fluoride, Argon Fluoride lasers are the most advanced commercial photolithography systems short of EUV. Immersion lithography techniques - referred to as 193i - are technically feasible for use until the 7 nanometer node. </p><p>The economics of 7 nanometers without EUV however, are not as clear. I did a video about this for Patrons. </p><p>Neon excimer lasers are also used for certain medical applications. The laser performing Lasik is a 193 nanometer laser. </p><p>I have also heard they have applications in nuclear fusion as well. Which amuses me for some reason. </p><h2>Lasers </h2><p>Excimer lasers like those made by Cymer and Gigaphoton are used for photolithography because of their high power output, stability and reliability. Here is how it works. </p><p>An excimer laser has a cavity filled with a gas blend. What that blend is depends on the laser, but for ArF lasers it is a mix of argon, fluorine, and neon. Despite the name, neon takes up over 95% of the mix. </p><p>Along the inside of the cavity, an electrode introduces a high energy electrical pulse discharge to ionize argon and fluorine atoms. These ions get temporarily excited and merge together into Argon Fluoride. </p><p>This argon fluoride then disassociates back to Argon and Fluorine atoms, but in doing so they release a burst of deep ultraviolet photons. This is the stuff we need. </p><p>The DUV photons bounce back and forth within the chamber between two ferns, I mean mirrors. One of the mirrors is fully reflective, and the other is partially reflective. </p><p>When the light gets strong enough, it bursts through the partially reflective mirror and on to the wafer. </p><h2>Reduce </h2><p>The neon gas's role is to increase the excitation rate of the Argon Fluoride reaction. It can be replaced with helium and other noble gases but this either does not work as well or has more substantial cost issues.</p><p>Because the neon is exposed to a great deal of energetic ions inside the laser, it degrades and accumulates impurities. And thus has to be replaced every couple of weeks, either through a total replacement or an occasional partial injection. </p><p>Over 50% of the world's neon is produced in Ukraine, which houses several large air separation units. </p><p>In 2015 and 2016, unrest in the area led to concerns within the semiconductor industry about their availability. </p><p>The industry has responded to this concern with a multi-step process. In the short term, laser makers like Cymer reverted to older, less gas-intensive methodologies to provide 50% gas savings right off the bat. </p><p>They also stretched the intervals between refreshes and injections. Engineers at Cymer have been able to reduce usage by another 30-50% by modifying the algorithms controlling gas injects without compromising on performance. </p><h2>Recapture and Recycle</h2><p>As a longer term solution, Cymer, Gigaphoton and others introduced neon recycling technologies. Previously, the exhausted noble gases were vented into the atmosphere - with the exception of fluorine which is toxic and needs to be scrubbed. </p><p>Now the used gases are extracted from the laser chamber and transported to an external facility for purification. They are continuously funneled into a recovery tank underneath the cleanroom floor. </p><p>When the tank is full, the air is filtered using several absorption columns to remove nitrogen, oxygen and argon impurities. Then it is sent back into the laser chamber. </p><p>The process works with about 85-92% efficiency, can be done within the fab itself, and does not affect laser performance. Laser energy stability remains constant and there's no new wafer loss error. </p><p>Recycling neon is some 15 times cheaper energy-wise than generating more gas in an ASU. However, because the gas is a commodity and rather cheap to acquire, fabs aren't incentivized to do it for cost reasons. </p><p>This is because recycling requires a re-engineering of the excimer laser design. And since the external scrubber unit also needs to be put underneath the cleanroom floor, it obviously means production has to stop. So there's a substantial financial trade off. </p><p>Depending on gas usage rates, this recycling system saves about $450,000 a year assuming a price of $3 per liter for neon. At the end of January, the cost is almost $9 per liter. </p><p>Depending on your math, it might make more sense to just keep buying more gas even at the higher prices. Cymer back in 2016 - a time of neon shortage - noted that neon recycling unit adoption across their 2,500+ unit base was about 16%. But what if the gas can literally not be had? Therein lies the problem.</p><h2>Conclusion </h2><p>In general, semiconductor companies should be thinking more about sustainability. But as is so often the case in industry, it is only when the bottom line starts getting hit that these companies start adopting the three R's. </p><p>For certain companies that have invested in the equipment and processes, they should be fine. TSMC for their part has said that the impact to their supply chain will be "limited". </p><p>But many other wafer fabs - especially those running DUV machines - are working on short margins and they probably didn't do this. </p><p>Unless supply can be made up by facilities in China - a growing supplier - or elsewhere then an extended neon shortage can indeed cause supply issues. It's not their first rodeo, however, so I do suspect they will be ultimately minor. </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://asianometry.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share The Asianometry Newsletter&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://asianometry.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share The Asianometry Newsletter</span></a></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Big Semiconductor Water Problem]]></title><description><![CDATA[If you want to watch the video, it is below Today, I write this right now in the midst of a massive deluge in Taipei.

But the good thing is that recycling technologies are a lot better today than they were many years ago. They have to, because you can&#8217;t simply draw water from a place in an unlimited manner. Even if that place isn&#8217;t a desert. </em></p><div><hr></div><p>As I am writing this, Taiwan is suffering through one of its worst droughts in many years. The northern-western part - Taipei, New Taipei City - is generally fine. There are enough reservoirs. </p><p>But other areas like Tainan, Kaohsiung, Taichung, and Hsinchu are having some issues. Their water infrastructure is not as resilient or their water demand is greater. There are reports in the media of TSMC budgeting for millions of dollars to truck water down to its fabs in Tainan.</p><p>Ah, and TSMC along with Intel and a bunch of other chip companies are building fabs in Arizona. A land inundated with clean, fresh drinking water. </p><p>The company - and the industry as a whole - has long had to deal with water usage issues at their facilities. And the problem is only going to get worse as we progress forward. </p><h2>Water in Chip Fabrication </h2><p>When people think about water shortages, they think about faster showers, less flushing, and the like. And saving water in the home is important. But water usage in the agricultural and industrial spaces far exceeds home residential usage. And semiconductor manufacturing in particular uses a lot of it. </p><p>Much of this water is for washing wafers. 30-40% of the steps in modern wafer fabrication involves some form of wafer cleaning. </p><p>For instance, there is a step called "wet cleaning", where sequential wash steps are applied to remove organics, metals, and particles from the wafer. Between each of those washing steps, water is used to rinse off the chemicals from the previous steps. </p><p>And semiconductor companies cannot use regular tap water out of your sink to wash these wafers. Instead they must use ultrapure water. Yes, that is a real industry term. </p><p>Ultrapure water is water. It is used in various other applications like nuclear energy or chemical manufacturing. But the cleanliness standards in the semiconductor industry are stricter than almost all the others. </p><p>In the industry they are trying to remove what are called &#8220;killer particles&#8221;, particles large enough to affect a chip's nano-architecture. These can be microorganism waste, organic particles, dissolved metals, gases and more. As much of these as possible must be scrubbed out of the water. </p><p>It is a lot of work to generate and verify the purity of ultrapure water. There are over a dozen steps and a number of those steps are repeated over many loops. </p><p>It takes about 6,000 liters or 1,600 gallons of city water to create 3,800 liters or 1,000 gallons of ultrapure water. And a single 200-mm or 8-inch wafer can use over 5,600 liters or 2,000 gallons of ultrapure water. </p><h2>The Chips Matter Too </h2><p>The types of circuits made also affect water usage. Wafers are made in layers. And as I mentioned earlier, each time a layer is made, it needs to be washed and cleaned before the next layer can be applied. </p><p>Logic circuits like microprocessors have more layers and are more complex than other types of semiconductors such as memory ICs, display panels, or solar panels. Thus, their manufacture requires more water and energy. </p><p>In 2020, TSMC noted in their corporate social responsibility report that they were not able to reach their water consumption goals, set a few years back. They had wanted to reduce the liters of water consumed per 8-inch wafer equivalent layer by 27%. They ended up doing just 5%. The reasons for this are due to increased demands for process cleanliness. </p><p>In other words, the more advanced the node process is, the thirstier it tends to get. It means more layers to wash. More ultrapure water needed. And more stringent standards for that ultrapure water. With each new process node, the threshold for something to be a killer particle gets a little smaller, making it that much harder to scrub out.  </p><p>So the cutting edge chips of today take more water to fab than they did 10 years ago, despite all the advances made in water reuse and conservation. And it is likely the trend will continue. </p><h2>Treating Wastewater </h2><p>We can&#8217;t just only think about all the water coming in. We also got to consider what&#8217;s coming out. </p><p>These processes generate a lot of wastewater and much of it needs to be treated. In 2013, TSMC&#8217;s fabs in Tainan generated 19 million tons of wastewater. Tainan the entire city that same year generated 29 million tons. </p><p>Wastewater left behind from this wet washing contains a high amount of pollutants like ammonia, phosphate and fluoride. There are studies of semiconductor workers getting cancer from exposure to these chemicals.</p><p>And not all wastewater is the same. Some of it needs more expensive and extensive treatments than others. For instance, ultraviolet light which is used for disinfection, is relatively cheap. But others like reverse electrodialysis, where salt ions are transported through a membrane using the power of friendship, cost substantially more. </p><p>So to properly deal with all these different types of wastewater, large foundries separate the streams and give each one their own special treatment, addressing over 25 chemicals in total.</p><p>Some of the final treated water output is reusable, meaning that you can put it back into the system and generate more ultrapure water with it. </p><p>But some of that water won&#8217;t be reusable, so it is most often put into the cooling tower where it is evaporated away to help maintain temperatures. This helps control the environment within the massive fab, the single biggest use of the facility's energy and water after direct manufacturing. </p><p>Such a system is complicated and expensive. So for many smaller companies, it is more cost effective to simply aggregate the water, broadly treat it, and return it to the city once it meets minimum health and safety requirements. They would then get new raw water from the city to process into ultrapure. </p><p>Large fabs like TSMC, Samsung and Intel have to implement these water reuse and recycling technologies because of their scale. They have to make so many chips that without these water recycling techniques they would run out pretty quick. </p><p>This explains why TSMC's recycle rate in 2017 was 87%, but per a Singapore study also done in 2017, the average semiconductor fab recycles less than half of that: 42%. </p><h2>Finding Water in Tainan - TSMC</h2><p>In 2019, TSMC fabs in Tainan alone consumed 50,000 metric tons or 50 million liters of water a day. </p><p>Sourcing all that raw water to be used is a challenge. The area draws from the Nanhua and Zengwen reservoirs, which as of right now are dangerously low in capacity. And Taiwan's south is also its agricultural heart, which needs water to feed its population. </p><p>To keep from draining the area's water supply, the company's fabs had to optimize their water draw and usage. </p><p>In addition to the water recycling technologies we talked about earlier, the company built a large rain collection system to capture rainwater and store it in 700 ton tanks. After running some checks, the rain can be processed, used for landscaping purposes or sent to the sewers. </p><p>Meanwhile, the company has signed tenders to build water reclamation plants near its fabs. These would recycle industrial wastewater using reverse osmosis, hollow fiber ultra-filtration, sand filtration, and more. These procedures are kind of like Singapore's NEWater.</p><p>The first ones to come online are in Tainan Science Park. Additional reclaimed water capacity is expected to arrive in the coming years from future plants in the Yongkang and Anping areas of Tainan. </p><h2>Water in Arizona</h2><p>Considering all we have learned thus far, Arizona might seem a funny place to put a fab. Because as you might notice, much of the state is a desert. </p><p>Currently, 40% of total water demand is met by nonrenewable groundwater. The Colorado River and other surface water sources, 57% and reclaimed water provides the rest. So basically where the Colorado falls short, the shortfalls gets pulled out of the ground. This is not quite sustainable. </p><p>For the most part, the state government has managed to control water usage by transferring water away from the farms to the city. Agriculture devours the vast majority of water in the American southwest - almost 90% of total demand in 1980. Turning farmland in cities and suburbs over the years has helped curb overall water usage. </p><p>The state has attempted to come up with a coordinated plan for corralling water demand. But results have come up dry and people are still pumping groundwater. It is a concern. </p><h2>Why Arizona Then?</h2><p>So how does it make economic sense for a rational government to want to put a semiconductor fab there? There are two prevailing reasons. </p><p>The first is that high volume semiconductor manufacturing is such a profitable and high-value add industry that the state is willing to take on the cost. Even if that means shelling out to build water infrastructure or taking someone else's water allotment away. </p><p>The state gets paid a lot more for having foundries on its land than with other usages. A 2012 paper compared the economic value of four land usages in the city of Chandler, Arizona - where the fabs will be. The four usages were high value semiconductor manufacturing, industrial manufacturing, single story office buildings, and retail. </p><p>They found that the economic benefits from semiconductor manufacturing outweigh the costs of providing the water. Governments gets paid a lot more on a per-acre basis with semiconductor manufacturing than with other land usages. They are very much incentivized to bring these facilities here. </p><p>Much of this revenue enters the state coffers through property taxation. The industry brings less high paying jobs on a per-acre basis than with the other land usages. It is likely due to the fact that most of the work is automated. </p><p>The second reason has to do with these water recycling and reuse technologies. The industry is rich enough to be able to invest in water saving, reusing, and recycling techniques. That means a high percentage of water - far higher than with the other land usages - is theoretically returned to the wastewater system. </p><p>Thus for the foundries themselves, the other advantages that Arizona provides - a ready supply of educated talent, tax incentives, seismic stability among others - win out over the simple lack of water. </p><h2>Conclusion </h2><p>High value semiconductor manufacturing is so valuable and profitable that governments are more likely to find water for it by taking away someone else&#8217;s share - usually a farmer&#8217;s. That&#8217;s been the case in both Taiwan and Arizona, where farmers are finding their water allocations cut and diverted to tech companies. </p><p>Agriculture is the number one usage of water virtually everywhere. There is an argument to be made that most agriculture as it is practiced is not an economically efficient use of precious water. Especially if it comes out of the ground. </p><p>But there are political consequences associated with doing this. Farmers in the USA are some of the most valuable constituents around. Losing the farmers is a fast way to losing your reelection. So governments have to strike that balance delicately. </p><p>The semiconductor industry&#8217;s thirst will not abate. Moore's Law will continue pushing ahead. Water recycling, reduction techniques, and reuse technologies have to keep up. If not then at some point, there is not going to be enough water to go around for everyone.</p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://asianometry.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share The Asianometry Newsletter&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://asianometry.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share The Asianometry Newsletter</span></a></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Thailand's Hard Drive Industry Problem]]></title><description><![CDATA[If you want to watch the video, it is below: I followed up this video with one about Thailand&#8217;s automobile export industry.

For instance, floods in 2011 that caused a number of worldwide HDD shortages. </p><p>But I do think - like with the semiconductor shortage - it is worth studying how this situation came to be. And how, kind of like with Malaysia, Thailand has yet to be able to grow as far and fast beyond that as they would like. </p><p>In this video, we will look at how Thailand came to be a leader in the hard drive industry. And the daunting challenges associated with growing beyond that early success. </p><h2>Why is THAILAND the WORLD LEADER in HDD manufacturing?</h2><p>There are a few videos already on YouTube about how Thailand came to dominate the hard disk drive industry. Feel free to watch them. </p><p>But the thing that bothered me about the top recommended search result was that the video did not actually go into what happened all that much. So here is my take on the whole situation. </p><p>The short story is that Thailand and Southeast Asia in general benefitted from a massive outsourcing trend that began in the 1960s and 70s. Singapore first benefitted from the trend, which then spread to Malaysia and Thailand after Singaporean labor and currency got too expensive. </p><p>Over time, Thailand developed a strong competitive advantage in this particular area, anchored by an industrial cluster of local and foreign suppliers with a special proficiency in process engineering. This has helped them weather increased competition and challenges from abroad over the decades. </p><h2>Hard Drive Industry Dynamics </h2><p>A hard drive is immensely complicated. Here is how it works. Digital data is stored on rigid, rotating magnetic platters. The drive then reads and writes data from the platter using a moving actuator arm. </p><p>The actuator arm moves extremely precisely but also at incredibly high speeds. The magnetic platter rotates at up to 15,000 revolutions per minute. At the same time, the read-write head moves across the platter at distances less than the thickness of oil on a person's skin. </p><p>Despite that product&#8217;s complexity, the industry is immensely competitive. Each hard drive firm caters to demanding vendors who continually ask for price cuts. Product cycles are very fast and new features and technology advancements regularly emerge each year. </p><p>The industry has undergone several brutal rounds of consolidation. In 1985, there were over 60 hard drive manufacturers. By 2007, there would be just six. Today, there are only three major manufacturers left: Western Digital, Toshiba, and Seagate, the market leader. </p><p>Hard drive production has a fair amount of automation, so labor costs are only a small percentage of the final thing. However, even those small percentage points can drastically affect the company's overall profitability. And the industry is so competitive that if one firm off-shored, then all the others would have to as well. That is effectively what happened. </p><h2>Out of America</h2><p>Many of the major American HDD manufacturers were founded and are still based in California. For instance, Seagate Technology, the hard drive leader, had its factory in Scotts Valley, California. </p><p>They were the first to close its American manufacturing facilities and move them, not to Thailand, but Singapore. </p><p>Seagate chose Singapore not because it offered the cheapest labor. Thailand and Malaysia had far lower wages. But rather, Singapore had the best mix of government incentives, good infrastructure, educated skilled labor, and cost. </p><p>California on the other hand fell short on all three - a Seagate co-founder once said about the situation: "We had too many surfers." </p><p>This move would cause massive, long-lasting shifts in the Southeast Asian economy. Singapore quickly gathered global market share in hard drive production. From 1986 to 1996, they held 45-50% market share. A supplier ecosystem began to sprout up in the city-state. Some were foreign, but many were indigenous. </p><p>Singapore stood at the top of the Southeast Asian hard drive manufacturing chain. But starting in the mid 1980s, rising labor costs and an appreciating Singapore dollar pushed companies to look elsewhere in Southeast Asia. Somewhere close by to keep the supply chain moving. </p><p>This is how Thailand first entered the picture. But HDD production sprouted in other areas of Southeast Asia too. It was generally dependent on the company and the incentives. Seagate chose Thailand, but Hitachi chose the Philippines, and Western Digital chose Malaysia. </p><h2>Thailand</h2><p>Thailand first began major hard drive production efforts in 1983, when Seagate moved their head stack assembly work from Singapore to a suburb of Bangkok. What is head stack assembly?</p><p>The single most expensive component that significantly impacts disk drive performance is that read-write head. That can be further broken down into two sub-assemblies - the head stack assembly and the head gimbal assembly. </p><p>The head stack assembly largely deals with the moving actuator arm. </p><p>The head gimbal assembly hold the thin pieces of metal, called sliders, that perform the actual reading and writing. These can and often are produced in different locations. </p><p>The head stack assembly process is the most labor intensive segment in hard disk production, and thus was the first to off-shore. At the start, 80% of the goods would be imported to Thailand, where the process was done, and then the finished component was shipped back out to Singapore to be put together with the rest of the final product. </p><p>To help with this, the Thai government exempted the company from its high input tariff schemes since the products were for export. I have seen similar setups in Malaysia and their outsourced semiconductor services industry. </p><h2>Expanding Value Chain </h2><p>Over time, Seagate&#8217;s other assembly operations came to Thailand as well. Finally in 1987, Seagate began final assembly in Thailand's northeast, encouraged by a multi-year tax holiday from the government. The rest of the hard drive industry soon followed. </p><p>Throughout the 1990s, the hard drive makers steadily expanded their manufacturing activities in Thailand in order to have quick turnaround in the supply chain. That means more and more of the hard drive was eventually made there. That includes the more complicated head gimbal assembly, spindle motors, and PCBs. </p><p>Throughout this process, Thai affiliates gained additional technological knowledge in these procedures - founding Thai native firms to replace foreign ones and creating a thriving manufacturing cluster. At the start, some 80-90% of the hard drive's components had to be imported into Thailand for assembly. Today, that percentage has fallen to around 50%.</p><h2> The China Challenge </h2><p>This deep integration has helped Thailand retain its export markets throughout China's rise in the global economy. China is the world's largest exporter of hard drives, with over 30% market share when combined with Hong Kong. Twice that of Thailand. </p><p>At the same time however, Thailand imports far fewer hard drives than China. In 2019 and 2020, China had a negative trade balance in HDDs. This negative balance has existed since at least 2003. </p><p>You can interpret this data in many different ways. The way I see it, China is the world's workshop for final assembly of computers like MacBooks and Dell desktops. Despite producing a lot of hard drives for sale abroad, that product is not competitive enough to substitute for Thai imported drives. </p><p>With that being said, statistics have shown that China's rise as an exporting power has diverted a significant amount of Foreign Direct Investment away from Southeast Asian countries like Thailand. China is the instinctive first choice for foreign tech investment, and I don&#8217;t think the China US trade war much changes that. The Thai HDD industry will have to work hard to overcome that bias and maintain their position in the future. </p><h2>Thailand's HDD Industry Weakness: R&amp;D</h2><p>So far, all of this seems pretty good. And there is a lot that Thailand should be proud of. But it is not all peaches and cream. One of the industry&#8217;s biggest weaknesses has to do with the amount of product R&amp;D taking place within indigenous Thai firms. </p><p>As it is right now, Thai firms are very capable of taking a new design and bringing it to reality: Process engineering. However, new product research and development is still mostly performed outside of Thailand. </p><p>Usually at the western headquarters of the foreign hard drive multinationals. </p><p>Certain very high-value and advanced processes are also only performed within those companies&#8217; home countries. For instance, Seagate fabricates the actual magnetic read-write heads in Minnesota and Northern Ireland. </p><p>Being able to natively research and develop new technologies and products to market is a critical milestone in national industrial development. And this is something that requires government involvement, coordinating between academia and the private sector. </p><h2>Thailand's HDD Industry Weakness: Government </h2><p>So let us talk about government involvement. </p><p>For many years, the Thai government focused on crafting broad policies for attracting Foreign Direct Investment and let the market do the rest. As a result, they now lag behind in pushing for and implementing the same type of R&amp;D-heavy industry initiatives that helped Singapore, China, South Korea and Taiwan reach their current positions. </p><p>Their first formal industrial collaboration - the Hard Disk Drive Institute or HDDI of the Thailand Science Park - was set up in 2004, over two decades after Seagate first entered the country. Singapore, by contrast, took half as long to do something similar. </p><p>FYI, I do want to note the presence of an industry group known as IDEMA Thailand, though their work was mostly informal networking. </p><p>HDDI's guidance was to deepen the country's advantages in process engineering and R&amp;D by building up human capital. They encouraged companies like Western Digital to send their Thai engineers to the US for up to a year and a half of training. </p><p>They also helped establish cooperative research centers between universities and the industry, providing funding for research into advanced HDD manufacturing, components, and advanced storage technology. They also provided scholarships, training centers, and more. </p><p>All this stuff is useful and needed. However, the policy still falls short on building up indigenous technology capabilities. And for the life of me, I can't find out anything more on the program after 2007, which is not a great sign. To this day, university-industry linkages remain weak. </p><p>Without the proper local government encouragement, the local sector remains in a place of relatively low value add. And the multi-nationals call the shots on what knowledge gets transferred over. To be fair, those multi-nationals have been quite diligent and thoughtful about what to teach. But the family jewels stay in the vault. </p><h2>Conclusion </h2><p>Alongside the automotive sector, Thailand's hard drive industry has been one of the country's big successes. From 1987 to 1996, Thailand enjoyed an average annual GDP growth rate of 9.5%. Much of this was driven by the burgeoning growth of its electronics sector. </p><p>But since the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997, that growth has abruptly halted. From 2000 to the present day, GDP growth has averaged 2.8%.</p><p>The reality is that the country is caught in a middle-income trap. And their thriving hard drive sector is a mini-metaphor of the current situation. Like with Malaysia and its semiconductor industry, Thai-owned firms have less value-add, cannot afford R&amp;D, and rely too heavily on multinationals. Because of that, it is finding it harder to grow. </p><p>The hard disk drive industry as a whole has started to decline. Global shipments are down as PCs transition to solid state drives. Hard disks will still be needed for work stations and data centers, but future innovation will come from elsewhere. This decline threatens what progress Thailand has made in this small but critical part of the electronics industry. </p><p>Thai trade policies will have to evolve. And recent government actions have shown some promise. They include new incentives on technology acquisition, a focus on specific industries of note (like food), and more. All of these represent a new direction, but a couple plans and announcements will not be enough. </p><p>In the end, in order for this to work, the government will have to commit to seeing this through thick and thin. There has to be buy-in from top leadership, a philosophical shift in thinking away from decades of policy. And also perhaps some administrative stability as well.</p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://asianometry.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share The Asianometry Newsletter&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://asianometry.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share The Asianometry Newsletter</span></a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Intel in Israel: A Semiconductor Success]]></title><description><![CDATA[If you want to watch the video, it is below: Sometimes you do a video and it sits as evergreen content for a long time.

And then there are times like this Intel video when suddenly a whole bunch of things happens. </p><p>I wrote this video about 3 months before its release, the standard Early Access video window. While it was sitting in Early Access, Intel announced that it <a href="https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1509/intel-announces-intent-to-take-mobileye-public">intended to take</a> Mobileye public. </p><p>From what I&#8217;ve read about Mobileye while I was making the video, it seems like a win-win for both parties. Mobileye never really integrated into the rest of the Intel superstructure. It seems like they have a pretty strong culture. </p><p>At the same time, Intel bought Mobileye during a period when the company was in a little bit of a wandering phase. It seems like they wanted to own more value-added semiconductors and ASICs in cutting edge industries like self-driving cars. But now they are refocusing on manufacturing and that is going to cost a lot of time, energy, and money. The way I see it, IPO&#8217;ing Mobileye helps Intel focus and monetizes an asset that they can leverage in the future for more cash. </p><p>Then shortly after this video released, Intel announced that they <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/feb-2022-corporate-news.html">are going to purchase Tower Semiconductor</a> for, like, $5.4 billion. I remember thinking to myself when I was writing the Tower Semiconductor sidebar, &#8220;Some commenter is going to tell me that this has nothing to do with Intel and you&#8217;re just padding for content&#8221;. Now I look like an oracle! </p><p>The video originally started out as a detailed study of Israel&#8217;s semiconductor prowess, particularly in manufacturing. But I soon realized that while the country has plenty of tech software startups and big design centers, the actual semiconductor manufacturing bit has shrunken over the years. Much like how it has been for many other countries. Tower was just one of two left, so I felt it had to go into the video. </p><p>Anyway. I reckon it&#8217;s a good buy for Intel. Tower can seed future Intel foundry efforts. Other people have said smarter things about it. But for me it passes the smell test. </p><p>One last thing. After the video released, I got more than the usual amount of email and feedback. A number of Intel employees wrote to me sharing some of their experiences working for Intel and respectfully chiding me about some of the more critical things I said about the company&#8217;s presence there. I am thankful for their feedback. </p><p>Looking back at it, I think I might have made it seem that I expected Intel to be this saving grace for a city like Kiryat Gat. That should never be the case. I feel that ultimate responsibility for providing life and livelihood falls on the city and municipal government. A company isn&#8217;t responsible for that. Intel has done more than its fair share of community building in Israel and <a href="https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=856300">it&#8217;s quite well documented</a>. I don&#8217;t doubt that their presence is a net positive. </p><div><hr></div><p>Israel is Intel's biggest location outside of the United States. And the American giant is the country&#8217;s biggest private employer. </p><p>Intel is investing billions of dollars into bulking up its manufacturing capacity and technical prowess. Israel hosts one of the company's few leading edge fabs outside of the United States, and plays a crucial part in their new corporate strategy. </p><p>In this video, we are going to look at how tiny Israel came to be so important to the semiconductor giant. </p><h2>A Note </h2><p>I have been afraid of doing this video for a long time. I am aware that the country of Israel and its people are involved in some controversial issues. As well as more than a few groundless conspiracy theories. </p><p>This video is going to focus on Intel Israel. I am not really going to address or discuss the country's other situations. I have never been to Israel, and I am not being paid by them. </p><p>I know that some people are going to be very angry at this. Their feelings may be justified or not. But I ask that you all be civil in the comments section. </p><h2>The Israeli Economy: Beginnings </h2><p>Let&#8217;s start with a brief overview of the country's economic history. The state of Israel was founded in 1948 in the midst of war. </p><p>After the cease-fire agreements were signed in 1949, the country received nearly 600,000 immigrants. This essentially doubled the country's population and strained their resources. </p><p>Over the next ten years, the Israeli economy was defined by a low exchange rate, rationing, and price controls. The country benefitted from large capital inflows due to US aid, German reparations, and bond sales. </p><p>At this point, the government maintained a protectionist economic policy. Like many other developing countries, they focused on developing a domestic textile industry capable of substituting their imports. </p><p>And at the same time, they subsidized the exports of goods like citrus fruits and cut diamonds to collect foreign currency. Cut diamonds remain a big part of the Israeli export portfolio. Very slowly over time, the government liberalized the economy. They lifted trade protections and gradually stopped managing the currency. </p><h2>The Israeli Economy: Laters</h2><p>The Arab-Israel Conflict has deep historical roots. But it especially escalated in the 1960s and continues to this day. Though its intensity declined in the 1990s. </p><p>The Conflict forced the Israeli government to dedicate a large portion of its economic budget to defense. At its height - during the Yom Kippur War of 1973 - the Israeli defense budget made up 30% of the country's GNP. </p><p>Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the government decreased its involvement in the economy. They also started traditional social welfare programs like healthcare, old age pensions, and unemployment benefits. </p><p>The 1990s also saw the flowering of the country's high-tech industry. The country's close ties to the United States allowed for its people to identify and fill gaps in the market. Israeli companies have ready access to American capital. </p><p>Furthermore, they have successfully adopted its venture capital model to create a mini-Silicon Valley of small start-ups. Many have been acquisition targets for American companies looking to add interesting technologies or start operations in Israel. </p><h2>Human Capital</h2><p>The first major American semiconductor company to set up a design center in Israel was Motorola in 1964. That center developed some of the company's most famous chips like the 68030 - used in the Macintosh II and NeXt Cube. </p><p>Motorola still has a presence there to this day, though it is not all that large. Other companies with substantial R&amp;D centers in Israel include IBM, Google, Nvidia, Facebook, and Microsoft. </p><p>One of the major reasons why companies invest in Israel has to do with its plethora of human capital. Their population of about 7 million people are highly educated, with strengths in the life sciences, math, physics, and computer science. </p><p>Israel has more engineers per 10,000 employees than the United States, Japan, and Taiwan. Israel has 135, while America has 70 and Taiwan, 34. </p><p>Note that this statistic is self-reported by the Israelis so of course take it with a grain of salt. But the main point is clear: Lots of smart, educated people. This well of human capital draws from three significant demographic and economic trends. </p><h2>Defense</h2><p>The first trend goes back to the military. Israeli society is partly defined by its porous boundaries between the civilian and military spheres. The Israeli Army regularly taps the civilian sector for resources and new skills. </p><p>All Israeli youth have compulsory military service. There, the army tries to identify technically talented youth early and nurture their competencies. </p><p>Up until the 1980s, the Israeli military supported the country's electronics sector. For instance, the development of the Lavi Fighter, based on the American F-16. </p><p>However, domestic military budgets have declined in recent years, releasing substantial amounts of skilled human capital into the labor market. Many commercial innovations thus have some form of military origin. </p><h2>Immigration </h2><p>Like the United States, Israel is a country of immigrants. Jewish people have the right to come and live in Israel. New citizens have generally come in waves. </p><p>The first wave of Israeli immigration at the end of the 1940s was quite significant. However, the biggest and most valuable wave of Israeli immigrants would be the ones coming after the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s. </p><p>From 1990 to 2000, more than a million people came to Israel. The country's population increased by 20%. Furthermore, 60% of those people were university educated and the country doubled its population of engineers and doctors. </p><h2>Education </h2><p>24% of Israelis have university degrees. And 12% of the workforce have advanced degrees. </p><p>Israel hosts seven major universities, all of them are world-class research institutions. The computer science department at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology is one of the largest in the world. </p><p>It is not enough to just make new discoveries. You also have to successfully commercialize them too. Each university has a Transfer of Technology Office that patents and commercializes university research. Stanford and MIT have similar offices. </p><p>These universities play a big role in fostering Israel's high-tech economy. But they also have a much more direct role in founding Intel Israel. </p><h2>Founding Intel Israel </h2><p>In 1974, a senior researcher at Intel - and I am going to butcher this poor man&#8217;s name - Dov Frohman - decided to return to Israel to accept a professorship at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. He had left Israel in the 1960s to get a PhD in electrical engineering, but long wanted to return. </p><p>Frohman is a very early Intel employee and the inventor of the erasable programmable read only memory (EPROM). Before Intel became a microprocessing giant, the company manufactured memory. EPROM was its most profitable product well into the 1980s. </p><p>Thus, the company did not want to lose him. So they decided to spend about $300,000 in 1974 dollars to open its first overseas design and development center outside the United States. This center was located in Haifa. </p><p>Intel Israel chose to establish in Haifa mainly because of the presence of the Technion Israel Institute of Technology. Haifa however was far from the country's big urban centers - Tel Aviv and Jerusalem - which made recruitment a bit of a challenge. Later on, Intel Israel would expand to cover much of the country. </p><h2>Growing in Israel</h2><p>Frohman served as Intel Israel's first general manager. They had five engineers and started with small, relatively insignificant projects. </p><p>This overseas design center turned out to be very successful. They were quickly tasked with designing very complex chips. For instance, Intel Israel was assigned the task of implementing the design of the Intel 8087 in 1980, notable for its math co-processing. </p><p>Notably, Intel Israel continued running even during a series of Scud missile attacks during the First Gulf War in 1990. Some 80-85% of the employees showed up to work despite the threat of missiles. Admittedly, the actual risk of someone getting hurt was relatively low. But it helped send a message to upper management back home that the division delivered regardless of geopolitical risk. </p><p>Intel Israel's success encouraged other foreign high-tech multinational companies to follow the same model. Soon thereafter, other senior R&amp;D managers at National Semiconductors and Applied Materials came to Israel to found R&amp;D centers there. </p><h2>Starting Manufacturing </h2><p>In 1984, Intel Israel would expand its operations to include manufacturing. In 1978, Intel CEO Gordon Moore visited Israel to tour the facilities there and returned impressed. </p><p>Frohman visited Santa Clara and pushed then-COO Andy Grove to consider putting a semiconductor manufacturing fab in Israel. At the time, the company's American facilities were going through some output shortages. </p><p>Andy Grove saw two presentations - one on Israel and the other on Ireland. He chose the former. Fab 8, situated in Jerusalem, was the company's first outside the United States. Production began in 1985. </p><p>During the 1990s, the Jerusalem plant produced 75% of the company's super-successful Intel 386 microprocessors. While it did well, it was too small to scale up and was eventually converted into a die preparation plant. </p><p>By then Intel had expanded its manufacturing facilities to the southern city of Kiryat Gat. Fab 28a opened in 1996. Fab 28, producing chips using the 45nm process, opened in 2008. </p><p>The latter cost $3.5 billion. Like is so often the case in the semiconductor industry, Intel negotiated a $525 million encouragement investment from the government to help seal the deal. </p><p>Recently, Intel announced a brand new $10 billion expansion to the Kiryat Gat facilities. Backed again, as always, with a healthy dose of government money. </p><p>The goal for Fab28 would be to produce chips using the 22nm and 10nm nodes. That latter node is now referred to in Intel marketing as Intel 7. </p><p>This makes Israel one of the few countries in the world to host a leading edge semiconductor manufacturing node. You can count them on one hand. Intel's fabs in Ireland and the United States, Samsung's in Korea, and TSMC's fabs in Taiwan. </p><h2>Mobileye </h2><p>In March 2017, Intel announced that it would be paying $15 billion to acquire the Israeli company, Mobileye. The company provides technology for self-driving cars. They are seen as Intel's bet on the massive future benefits of autonomous vehicles. </p><p>Despite making relatively little revenue, the company has struck some interesting partnerships with various large companies like Nissan, Volkswagen, and BMW. In recent years they have been trying to turn their technology into more of a platform accessible by a variety of system integrators. </p><p>Intel recently acquired the transit web service Moovit for $900 million. They then added within it an experimental autonomous taxi service powered by Mobileye. </p><p>Then in April 2021, they announced a deal in which Mobileye would provide the autonomous drivers for self-driving delivery vehicles. </p><p>Acquisitions like that of Intel and Mobileye have been an underrated entry point for expanding a multinational&#8217;s presence in Israel. Few countries are so open to having some of their best acquired by foreigners. </p><h2>Intel Israel Today </h2><p>Today, the division employs some 10,200 people. In 2020, it produced $8 billion USD for the company. In over 40 years of their time there, Intel invested $14 billion into Israel and received over $40 billion of exports. </p><p>The presence of the Intel giant - and others like it - have contributed to a spillover effect. First in the form of purchases from local firms. Intel self-reports that they sourced supplies and raw goods from some 200 Israeli firms - three quarters of which are small or medium sized. </p><p>And second, the company trains skilled workers and managers who leave and bring their skills into the surrounding local economy - joining or starting small semiconductor businesses of their own. </p><p>However, the presence of a fab or design center in a particular city is not game changing to many of its residents. For Kiryat Gat in particular and its working class population of 50,000. Many of its unemployed are former textile workers laid off in the 1990s. </p><p>In the mid-2000s when Intel was building their $4 billion Fab 28, one might expect massive trickle-down effects on the surrounding population. But most of those billions went into capital expenses for fabrication hardware. </p><p>The nature of modern semiconductor manufacturing means that much of the process is automated. Much of its technicians are from out of town. For the local residents, hosting a fab has all the economic trickle down effects of hosting an alien spaceship. </p><p>Governments dole out millions of incentives to build fabs for a multitude of reasons. Many of them very legitimate. But revitalizing the local economy should probably not be one of those reasons. Kiryat Gat still has one of the country's highest unemployment rates. </p><h2>Tower Semiconductor </h2><p>Intel Israel is not the only semiconductor manufacturer in the country. Tower Semiconductor is a significant niche manufacturer and I thought their story interesting enough to warrant a small sidebar. </p><p>The company was founded in the early 1990s when it acquired a 150-millimeter wafer fabrication fab from National Semiconductor. They went public on the NYSE in 1994 and have since then added facilities in Japan and the United States. </p><p>In 2020, they cleared over a billion dollars in annual revenues. Their fabs are nowhere near the leading edge, but their specialization in niche products like optical transceivers and mobile radio frequency chips keeps them in business. </p><p>In a previous video, I discussed Skywater Technologies in the United States. They have a similar founding story and business strategy focusing on niche and specialty processes. </p><div id="youtube2-ErRzxyp0VQQ" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;ErRzxyp0VQQ&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ErRzxyp0VQQ?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>While fabless semiconductor firms have a lot of great points about them, one should not forget the manufacturing piece as well. Over time, that has shrunken even in high-tech Israel. </p><p>Most recently, Micron the memory-maker sold their chip-making facility to Intel in 2013. </p><p>The Israeli government, recognizing the importance of having domestically located semiconductor manufacturing facilities, has been quite involved. They have given Tower subsidies and tax breaks, and use them as a customer. </p><h2>Conclusion </h2><p>You want to strike a balance when it comes to inviting large multinationals into your developing country. You can learn and gain a whole lot from them. But there is a risk that they take advantage of what you have to offer and give little in return. </p><p>For instance, look at the situation of Intel in Malaysia. The country hosted one of the company's first locations outside of the United States. But their semiconductor industry soon found itself caught in the middle - challenged by others on cost but without enough skill to ascend the value chain. </p><p>The Intel Israel situation seems to be one where things are working out right. The partnership between the two has yielded incredible benefits for both parties. </p><p>The key difference between Intel in Malaysia and Intel in Israel seems to have to do with the activities being off-shored. In the case of the former, Intel needed only its workers' hands and fingers. In the case of the latter, Intel was looking to tap its workers' minds.</p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://asianometry.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share The Asianometry Newsletter&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://asianometry.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share The Asianometry Newsletter</span></a></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How Hong Kong Beat the Speculators]]></title><description><![CDATA[A Newsletter Exclusive]]></description><link>https://asianometry.substack.com/p/how-hong-kong-beat-the-speculators</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://asianometry.substack.com/p/how-hong-kong-beat-the-speculators</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jon Y]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2022 17:00:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/f4aSNErZxDo" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="youtube2-f4aSNErZxDo" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;f4aSNErZxDo&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/f4aSNErZxDo?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>Believe it or not but George Soros used to be a hedge fund manager too. His Quantum Fund will go down in legend as the second best performing hedge fund after RenTech's Medallion Fund. Begun in 1969, the fund reportedly returned 35% a year net of fees into the mid 1990s. </p><p>With the outbreak of the Asian Financial Crisis in the late 90s, Soros and a number of other funds speculated on currency depreciations across all across Asia. He invested a sum of money betting that Hong Kong would abandon its efforts to link its own currency to the US dollar.  </p><p>But the Hong Kong government spent $15 billion in August 1998 to subvert those expectations and force the currency speculators to close their trades. The peg has not been seriously challenged since then. </p><p>In this video, we are going to talk about the currency peg, why it matters, and how Hong Kong beat the speculators. </p><h2>How the Peg Works </h2><p>Hong Kong&#8217;s money exists in several forms. In addition to the bank notes that you find in people's wallets, there are certificates of indebtedness and other financial instruments issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. Together, we have the monetary base. </p><p>The peg requires that every Hong Kong dollar within that monetary base has to be backed by US dollars at a rate of 7.80. Every transaction of Hong Kong dollars going in or out of the system is exchanged at a similar range. </p><p>The Hong Kong monetary authority has the capacity to intervene into the currency markets to maintain the pegged exchange rate. Natural forces such as currency arbitrage traders also help in keeping the market currency exchange rates close to the pegged rates. </p><p>I hope that did not confuse you too much. The key point to think about is that, unlike Tether, each Hong Kong dollar in your hand is backed by an equivalent amount of US Dollars. It is like back in the old days of metals-backed currencies but in this case, the US Dollar is the gold or silver. </p><h2>A History of the Hong Kong Currency Peg </h2><p>So why have a peg? Until 1935, the Hong Kong currency was linked to silver. That year, the Government confiscated all the silver from the banks and linked the Hong Kong dollar to the British pound sterling. The rate was 1 pound to 16 HKD. </p><p>In 1972, the British government decided to freely float the pound, meaning to allow the currency markets to determine the exchange rate. So the Hong Kong government relinked the Hong Kong dollar to the US dollar. When the US dollar also went free floating two years later in 1974, the Hong Kong government decided to follow suit and float its currency. </p><p>This did not go well. These were turbulent times. Economic conditions were volatile from year to year. Inflation went from 2.7% in 1975 to 15.5% in 1980. The HKD exchange rate wildly moved from $5.13 to $9.60. </p><p>And then throughout 1982 and 1983, negotiations between China and the United Kingdom loomed over Hong Kong's future and economic viability post-1997. There was wild speculation over what might happen and the currency reflected that uncertainty. </p><p>The currency fluctuations threatened the stability of the banks. The Hang Seng stock market index dropped 30% from July to September 1983. The Hong Kong dollar lost 15% of its value against the US dollar in just two days. People, as they always tend to do, panic-bought toilet paper in the supermarkets. </p><p>The government needed to bring stability to the currency markets. So on October 17, 1983, the Hong Kong government imposed a currency peg of $7.80 HKD to $1 USD. They picked $7.80 because it was a nice middle between the $6.60 before the crisis and $8.80 at the time of announcement. </p><p>It has been like this ever since. Things have been up and down at times afterwards but the key point is that the government considers the peg a critical contributor to stability within the Hong Kong economy. Many of its businesses depends on trading and monetary flows between itself, China and the West, so having the peg be questioned is a problem. </p><h2>Soros </h2><p>Okay let us bring in our guy. The Quantum fund follows a global macro strategy. This means that it invests based on theses about the world&#8217;s economies. For example, the manager might think that the world is heading for much more inflation and thus make bets that pay off if inflation happens. For a time this was a very effective investment strategy. </p><p>Soros is infamous for "breaking" the Bank of England with a single currency trade. What does that mean? </p><p>The summer of 1992 was a period of economic instability in Europe and the United Kingdom. The countries of Europe were attempting to manage their currencies ahead of a formal currency union - a situation where all of these European countries would use one currency.</p><p>But political squabbling broke out between those governments, causing mass uncertainty. The monetary policy did not suit the current, weak state of the British economy. Traders began to sell the British pound for other currencies. This caused the pound's exchange rate to decline. </p><p>For many currencies today, that is alright. But here in this particular situation, the governments had agreed to maintain their currencies' exchange rate within a tight range. The Bank of England pledged to spend its foreign reserves to keep the currency within that range despite those pressures. </p><p>Soros and the Quantum Fund had already made a lot of money betting against the Italian lira. So when his lieutenant Stanley Druckenmiller, himself another well-known hedge fund manager, recommended a $2 billion US bet against the pound, Soros wanted to go bigger. </p><p>He took his entire $5 billion USD fund and borrowed $10 billion USD to bet against the British Pound. The Bank of England spent about $27 billion in foreign currency to defend the currency, but eventually caved and let the pound's value fall. </p><p>Soros made a billion dollars in profit and became a legend. </p><h2>The Asian Financial Crisis </h2><p>The Asian Financial Crisis refers to a series of financial crises in East and Southeast Asia. It began with Thailand suddenly devaluing its currency, the baht, in July 1997. The Thai stock market dropped 75% and the currency lost almost half of its value. </p><p>Thailand had fallen into this crisis due to a financial bubble that developed where cheap money fueled unsustainably high growth. The country's banks made loans backed by speculative property and stock markets, which took a huge hit when those bubbles popped. </p><p>It could be said that Hong Kong was in a similar situation to Thailand's. Lots of cheap money flowing into real estate and the stock markets. The Hang Seng stock index and real estate prices fell. Currency speculators started to turned their attention to Hong Kong. </p><p>Then in October 1997, the Central Bank of Taiwan announced that it would no longer defend its currency - the New Taiwan Dollar. The Bank spent $12 billion US in foreign reserves throughout the year trying to maintain its 28.6 NTD to USD peg without avail. After the free-floating announcement, the currency immediately fell to 30.5 NTD and then to 34.5 by January 1998. </p><p>With Taiwan's currency now free-floating, speculative selling shifted to the Hong Kong dollar. The market was betting that the Hong Kong government would follow suit. </p><h2>Intervention </h2><p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority at first took standard steps to stem the capital outflows. They asked banks to limit loans for property and stocks. They sold US dollars to buy more Hong Kong dollars to try and defend the currency. But downward market pressures continued to weigh on the Hong Kong dollar. </p><p>The government thought that these declines in the currency were not in line with Hong Kong's economic performance. The city's economy had grown 6% every year over the past decade. The city had a healthy budget surplus and nearly a $100 billion USD in foreign reserves. Each Hong Kong dollar had US dollars behind it. How can the currency have these pressures?</p><p>In the absence of a fundamental economic reason, the government believed that the moves were the result of speculative actions by hedge funds. They believed the hedge funds were seeking to make profits through the use of a two-tier strategy. </p><p>In this theory, a fund was selling short both the Hong Kong dollar and the Hang Seng stock index. Successfully shorting the Hong Kong dollar and breaking the peg would cause the HKD to crash and interest rates to rise. Higher interest rates would then cause stocks to fall. </p><p>A fund with a short position on both stocks and the Hong Kong dollar would make money twice-over. The government estimated that the hedge funds had accumulated billions of HKD to execute this "double play" trade. </p><p>Thus on August 14, 1998, Financial Secretary Donald Tsang and the Hong Kong government announced that they would intervene into the market by purchasing shares of the Hang Seng stock futures, the underlying stocks themselves, and the Hong Kong dollar. They would spend $15 billion USD in this intervention, eventually taking large positions in Hong Kong's companies. They at one point owned 10% of HSBC. </p><p>Such interventions are pretty common today. The Japanese central bank today owns $272 billion of the country's stock market. </p><p>But back in the 1990s, Hong Kong's actions shook the business world, as it deviated from the city-state's reputation as a free market. From the perspective of the authorities though, the market was being manipulated. What they were doing was to free it.</p><p>Two weeks later on August 28th, the Mainland Chinese government itself remarked on Hong Kong's intervention, lending it their implied support. Traders realized that the investment thesis was not going to play out and bailed on the trade. </p><p>The intervention had worked. The Hong Kong dollar peg survived. Hong Kong interest rates returned to normal. That year, the Hong Kong economy grew 3.5%. Good growth despite a financial crisis. </p><h2>Conclusion </h2><p>Despite the accusations from the Hong Kong government, it is not exactly clear just how big of a role Soros and his hedge fund peers had throughout the crisis. Were they manipulating things behind the scenes? Or just making money and following the larger crowd? Shortly after the event, Soros said publicly that he did sell short the Thai baht currency, but no other East Asian currencies. </p><p>Ten years later though in 2009 he acknowledged in Beijing that his "attack, if you call it that, was without any success." He gave the Hong Kong government credit for intervening like they did. </p><p>A study a few years later looked at the $21 billion- USD sized Quantum fund's currency and stock positions throughout the crisis period. Their interpretation of the data says that Quantum did participate in the "double play" position and made $68 billion HKD ($8 billion USD) in profit throughout the whole ordeal. </p><p>But most of that was at the start of the crisis. After October 1997, Soros lost $122 billion HKD or $15 billion USD - presumably due to the intervention.  </p><p>The Asian Financial Crisis made it clear just how much the city-state benefits from its currency peg's stability. So in 2003 the Financial Secretary made it an explicit, written-down policy that they will maintain the peg. The peg has not been seriously questioned since. </p><p>A few hedge fund managers like Kyle Bass have speculated against it during the most recent crisis period, to no avail. </p><p>It&#8217;s not a perfect tool of course. There are some very real reasons why not to have it. For instance, there&#8217;s evidence that it imports easy money from the United States, inflating its real estate and stock assets. </p><p>But for now, the government continues to consider the peg a cornerstone of Hong Kong's economy. It stays.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://asianometry.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share The Asianometry Newsletter&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://asianometry.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share The Asianometry Newsletter</span></a></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Economics of Netflix's 17 Billion]]></title><description><![CDATA[And a Note on XBox Game Pass]]></description><link>https://asianometry.substack.com/p/the-economics-of-netflixs-17-billion</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://asianometry.substack.com/p/the-economics-of-netflixs-17-billion</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jon Y]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 09 Feb 2022 17:00:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/S7zxR13zIMk" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>If you want to watch the video, it is below.

And I think Netflix knows that - they consider anything that captures the user&#8217;s attention as their competition. Streaming video is a way to engage a viewer&#8217;s attention. A good TV show like Squid Game is pretty engrossing, but video games are even more so. So that is why Netflix started <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/let-the-games-begin-a-new-way-to-experience-entertainment-on-mobile">dabbling into video games</a>. </em></p><p><em>Today, the gaming industry - at $180 billion in revenue in 2021 - is twice as large as the movie industry</em>. <em>AAA video games cost as much as movies to make now, but can return a huge amount more money.

Who knows if it is, but companies are going to go there and find out. </em></p><div><hr></div><p>In 2021, Netflix dropped $17 billion in cash - $13 billion accrued - for its content. </p><p>A significant portion of that was spent on making its own shows and movies. In 2021, the company spent $5 billion on originals.</p><p>People aren't going out to see movies in the theaters anymore unless it's for a Marvel movie. Yet the film and TV production businesses are busier than ever before - pandemic shutdowns notwithstanding.</p><p>All of that is thanks to the streamers. What's the strategy behind all this content spending? </p><h2>Differing Content Strategies </h2><p>Content is hard to value. It is not like a box of biscuits. And different companies have different ways of doing so. However, the goal of a pure-play direct-to-consumer video subscription service is pretty straightforward: You want to grow the subscriber base. </p><p>You want to release content that gets more new customers to sign up and keeps old ones from churning - either to a competitor or to something else. And you have to make or buy that content at a reasonable return. </p><p>Netflix makes money from subscriptions. The longer people subscribe, the more it makes. And while some subscribers never use it and still keep their subscription, the best situation is that they watch a lot of shows on their Netflix account. And they keep watching month after month. </p><p>This requires vastly more content. Back when there were only 3-5 networks, the TV show production machine used to only have to make some four hours of original content a night from September to May. Cable expanded on that a little, but the season system remained. </p><p>Now, Netflix and the streamers have to commission, produce, and release new shows each month year-round. </p><p>In 2019, there were 500 original scripted series made. And because of the sheer volume, these have to be produced more quickly and cheaply. </p><p>In today's TV production environment, there is 60% less time from green-lighting to release - and 65% lower budgets per original content hour. </p><p>Amazon - and I presume Apple too - add a few tweaks to the model. Yeah they care about acquisition and retention too. But they also use their video subscription products - Amazon Video Prime and Apple TV Plus - as retention tactics within their particular ecosystem. </p><p>It is content marketing. Billion dollar white papers! Ha! Thus Amazon wants to measure what shows incentivize people to sign up or extend their Amazon Prime subscription. But more on that later. </p><h2>Netflix's Retention </h2><p>In October 2021, Netflix changed the way they reported their content viewership. They used to report just how many accounts watched a particular show for at least 2 minutes. </p><p>The new methodology would present the number of hours viewed for each show or movie. Presumably this says more about which shows or movies hold subscribers' attention for longer. Whereas you can argue that the old metric just told you how well the content&#8217;s thumbnail performed.  </p><p>However, we are still missing how far an individual subscriber gets through a particular show or movie: Retention. And retention is key. Is it 500 million people watching just 4 hours, or 2 billion people watching just 1? </p><p>A recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-17/squid-game-season-2-series-worth-900-million-to-netflix-so-far">Bloomberg news article</a> caught my eye, and in it there was a really interesting statistic: </p><blockquote><p>&gt; In the case of &#8220;Squid Game,&#8221; Netflix estimates that 89% of people who started the show watched at least 75 minutes (more than one episode) and 66% of viewers, or 87 million people, have finished the series in the first 23 days.</p></blockquote><p>90% of viewers finishing at least one episode and 66% finishing the whole show - that is kind of crazy good.</p><p>An example of this focus on retention: I have noticed that Netflix original shows don't have to hit the arbitrary 16 or 22 episode limits that a TV season requires. Thus, they tend to be tighter, without padding and random side quests. Netflix wants them to hold people&#8217;s attention longer. Not to fill up the hours. </p><h2>Value and Return on Investment </h2><p>In addition to a show's retention, Netflix assigns values to the people who are watching it. </p><p>Shows watched by new signups or who have been previously inactive are said to be more valuable. The idea is that the show got to be impactful enough to get them to reactivate their use of the service. </p><p>According to the Bloomberg article, the two are summarized into a single internal metric called "impact value". This metric makes the various shows inside the Netflix portfolio comparable with each other. Divide the impact value by the cost it took to make a show, and you get a return on investment metric. </p><p>Netflix reviews a show's impact value ratio 7 and 28 days after release. It reminds me of something that I have read somewhere with regards to YouTube. You are in the best position to judge a video's performance 7 days after upload rather than after 30 minutes when YouTube starts showing you stats. </p><h2> A YouTube Comparison </h2><p>Speaking of YouTube, it is interesting to me how these metrics overlap with what YouTube content creators work with and experience on a daily basis. And in this I can use some of my personal experiences for background. </p><p>The metrics that YouTube makes available to its content creators tell you a lot about how to think about making and valuing pieces of content. </p><p>Leaving aside the revenues from sponsorships and what not, one way your average YouTuber might value one piece of content over another would be to look at how much ad revenue it brings in. That is calculated based on two metrics: How long they watch, the retention, and who is watching, the audience. </p><p>Retention: The longer a person watches a video, the more ads they watch and the more the creator makes. The YouTuber MrBeast has repeatedly made clear that he wants people to watch 80% of his videos. </p><p>Not only because it racks up the ad impressions, but also because the YouTube algorithm seeks to reward good retention. A good retaining video is more likely to get pushed out to more users. </p><p>At the same time, YouTube assigns different values to who&#8217;s watching the videos - a metric it refers to in its dashboard as Revenue per Mille or RPM. The ways it is calculated, I have not really looked into and have had a hard time predicting. </p><p>What I have found most reliable - but not always, so - is by country. Viewers in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States deliver a much higher RPM than those in Taiwan for instance. That being said, I can't say that it much affects how I in particular pick and choose my topic ideas. </p><h2>Amazon's First Streams</h2><p>As I mentioned earlier, Amazon's strategy for Prime Video is slightly different from that of Netflix's. Retention is undoubtedly important to them, but they seem to be really focused on driving new signups. This makes sense since Prime Video is supposed to be a suitable acquisition channel for the rest of the Amazon ecosystem. </p><p>For Amazon, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-ratings-exclusive-idUSKCN1GR0FX">Reuters in 2018</a> mentioned a metric called "First Stream", and it is frequently referenced in the documents Reuters got to see. Note that these are older documents dated December 2016 so keep that in mind. But I don't see a reason why the overall strategy might be significantly different. </p><p>If someone streams the motoring series "Grand Tour" right after they sign up for Prime, then that show gets credited for the win - something they call a first stream. In that show's first season, Reuters reported that the Grand Tour had over 1.5 million first streams to Prime worldwide. </p><p>Once you have established these metrics as your ground truth, you are able to then calculate your returns by dividing by the amount of money you paid to acquire or create the piece of content. </p><p>The Grand Tour in this case cost $49 per Prime signup - the best of its cohort. Which is not bad if you recall that Prime cost $99 back then ($119 now), which means you&#8217;ve immediately made back your cost on revenues - not profit. But add to that the strategic benefit to Amazon for someone to have Prime - Prime members are far more locked into the ecosystem,  buying more stuff and all - and the show was a huge win for them. </p><p>In 2020, Amazon spent $11 billion on content, up 41% from the previous year. The fact this budget has kept on growing means that the strategy is working. The biggest and most dressed-up content marketing budget in the world. </p><h2>Bigger Budgets</h2><p>Originally, the company invested in niche TV that garnered critical acclaim and won big at the award shows. Bezos himself mentioned it in 2016: "When we win a Golden Globe, it helps us sell more shoes." </p><p>By 2017, however, the data conclusively showed that high-end prestige dramas and their awards were not delivering better cost per acquisition numbers than four-quadrant blockbusters. </p><p>In other words, more shows like Game of Thrones rather than "Transparent".</p><p>The company promptly changed tactics with a variety of franchises like the Wheel of Time and Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan. And of course, the $500 million mega-deal for the Lord of the Rings prequel TV series.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I recently watched on Netflix an episode of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voir_(TV_series)">TV show Voir</a>, made by the YouTubers who made "Every Frame a Painting". </p><p>This episode is called Film Versus Television. And it notes how the two mediums developed their own distinct, straightforward style. Film, with its limited time budget but richer canvas. Television, with an emphasis on character but shot to be watched on smaller screens. </p><p>It has made me think more about the style of a piece of content made for a streaming platform. I think that content - even if Netflix labels it a &#8220;movie&#8221; - falls more on the TV spectrum. </p><p>They apparently encourage their filmmakers to accommodate second screen consumption. In other words, on the phone while something else is going on up on the television. Which means less budget for the art department with bland props, bare walls, and big closeups of actors saying their lines. </p><p>The analytics are apparently bearing out the experiment. Everyone seems to hate Red Notice, but it's been the number one streamed movie for a while. </p><p>It's interesting to consider how the streaming business model will affect the viewing experiences of its content. Redditors say they want all of their movies on streaming and never have to go to the theaters ever again.

So for this newsletter I want to share some of the outlines and notes I prepared for this podcast. </p><div><hr></div><h2>TSMC Origins and setting the scene</h2><ul><li><p>A fun way, at least for me as a listener, to start my deep dives is with your history and background for what we&#8217;re about to dive into. So what&#8217;s you&#8217;re history with TSMC, what got you interested, and why are you passionate about this topic?</p><ul><li><p>Taiwan is obsessed with TSMC. And that has been the case for a very long time.</p><ul><li><p>It&#8217;s hard to put it into perspective and context for outsiders&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>&nbsp;Morris Chang is like Elon Musk here&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The Chinese nickname for the company is literally translated as the &#8220;Silicon Sacred Mountain&#8221; or the &#8220;Silicon Shield&#8221;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Recently I was in Kaohsiung and TSMC recently announced that they are going to put a new fab there - not sure what generation but not a leading one.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>And it was all everyone can talk about in the cafes and the conferences. I&#8217;m at Starbucks and there&#8217;s little old ladies talking about it.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>At a startup festival I was attending, the keynote speaker by a member of the municipality - I was later told he was the Mayor of Kaohsiung, after Han Guoyu got voted out - he came in and I didn&#8217;t understand what he said except for that him saying TSMC TSMC TSMC repeatedly. Like a chant.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>TSMC's new foundry consumed a third of Taiwan's newly generated power;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>There is a generation of Taiwanese who are now rich because they bought TSMC stock.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>its 40,000 plus employees also contributed more than 1% of total newborns in Taiwan in 2019.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Go to Hsinchu, you will find a plethora of children and families </p></li></ul></li><li><p>As for history of me and TSMC, I don&#8217;t speak to TSMC people and I almost never hear from them. On the other hand I&#8217;ve gotten many emails from ASML employees.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>And Dutch people are so nice.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>For listeners to get a bit of background and understanding, could you explain the chip development process from start to finish? So from maybe the original idea all the way through to ending up in our iPhones, could you detail that?</p><ul><li><p>You have four stages: Design, fabrication, packaging, and testing&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Semiconductor design starts with a specification.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>That specification is turned into a high level design representation of the chip - referred to as an RTL - using a language like Verilog.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Modern SOCs are architected by integrating hundreds of pre-designed and pre-verified hardware blocks or "cores". Without it, I don't think modern semiconductor design is possible at a commercial level.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>These cores are provided by an ecosystem of industry players - Original Equipment Manufacturers, 3rd party Semiconductor design houses, or TSMC.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>TSMC has a massive repo of IP property that it can license to you&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Then that high level representation is converted into a netlist, a bunch of gates. These are done with third party EDA tools like Cadence Genus Synthesis Solution.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The gates in the netlist are then placed and physically routed using EDA software.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The design is then transmitted to a foundry for fabrication, usually in a file format called GDSII.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>After fabrication, the wafer is cut, packaged, and tested before being shipped into the rest of the supply chain </p></li><li><p>These steps are called "assembly" (I have also seen it referred to as &#8220;packaging&#8221;) and "test". Together make up what we call the "back end".&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Someone has to cut the wafer into chips, encase them within ceramic or plastic so to make it easier to handle, and test them to ensure quality.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The work is mundane and repetitive but at the same time requires dexterity and close attention.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Furthermore, productivity is relatively low. 50-70% of the time, the guy is waiting for another machine to finish what it is doing.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>So TSMC is the first foundry to provide 7-nanometre and 5-nanometre production capabilities, and to put that into context, a human blood cell is about 2,500 nanometres, and in a single drop of blood, there&#8217;s around ~5 million red blood cells. So it&#8217;s hard to even fathom how they&#8217;re doing this kind of work. Could you maybe set the scene for how technologically difficult and impressive the work TSMC is doing? Especially because sometimes its easy to get a little lost in the numbers and nanometres and whatnot.</p><ul><li><p>Wafer manufacturing is hard. They do it in mask layers, a mask is used to reproduce a pattern onto a substrate, so you would put a whole chip pattern or part of a whole chip pattern into one mask layer&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Each mask layer requires steps with 15-25 per each mask layer. So there can be up to 600 steps, for a simple 180 nanometer process chip. That&#8217;s a chip from like 20 years ago.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The today ones - N14, N16, and N10 go up to 60, 70, 80 mask layers.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>This is super super hard. On a process with 400 steps, even if each step has a yield of 98%, the total yield of your wafer is just 0.03%, which means 3 good dies out of 10,000&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>TSMC is historically known for good yields. I was looking at Canaan financial filings. Company that makes BTC miners&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Their yields at 16 nanometers were 96% in 2017, 96% in 2018 and 95% in the six months ended June 30, 2019</p></li><li><p>TSMC 16nm has some 60 wafer layers, which means about 800-1200 steps. To achieve this, you need better than 99.99% yield on each of the 800 steps</p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Again for a little context, but could you give a little colour as to what the fabs look like and how they&#8217;re built? Because this is where the magic happens, so knowing the setup and infrastructure that allows this to happen is extremely interesting and important.<br></p><div id="youtube2-785Uzi1mGAA" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;785Uzi1mGAA&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/785Uzi1mGAA?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><ul><li><p>A fab is a factory just like any other. Fabs are built in phases. You got phase 1, phase 2, phase 3, usually when someone quotes big cost numbers, they are summing up all the phases together. You generally want to get these done within a year.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>A single fab cleanroom is a massive undertaking. Cleanroom size is directly correlated to expense. A fab with a cleanroom sized 8,000 square meters needs:</p><ul><li><p>Enough concrete for 25 km of road, 120 kilometers of ultra clean pipes, 250 kilometers of electric wire, 4,500 kilometers of steel bar</p></li><li><p>It uses 24 swimming pools of ultra pure water each hour (though much of that gets recycled)</p></li><li><p>It uses enough compressed air to fill 3,000 balloons each minute</p></li><li><p>It runs 24/7 all the time - night and day.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>And guess what? A TSMC Giga-Fab have cleanrooms 13 times larger across all their various phases </p><ul><li><p>Fab 18 in Tainan where N5 and N3 are being done is 20 times bigger, 160,000 square meters.&nbsp;<strong>(Note: Thanks to Ryan, Asianometry Discord member, for his correction that this is over multiple buildings - not 1 building). </strong></p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Why is it so hard to have an American semi conductor industry? Is the the talent hurdle too high?</p><ul><li><p>It is hard to catch up to the leading edge once you stop going for it -&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>And because the new leader is moving as fast as they are moving. If you want to catch up with the leader, you have to run faster than them because it is very easy and more financially profitable to just say &#8220;this is too hard and we don&#8217;t need a faster chip&#8221;&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>When it comes to Semiconductor manufacturing you are not only racing on a technical basis, you are doing it on an economic basis too&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Showing stuff on in a lab is nothing compared to actually doing it for customers at a profit&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Advanced manufacturing is very hard and it needs scale. The more scale that TSMC gets, the better it gets at manufacturing - which means their customers get faster chips at a cheaper price</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Hyper competitive manufacturing is a bad business. Why do you think all these tech companies are going to D2C subscriptions? It&#8217;s an easier life.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Taiwan lives and breathes semiconductors. The USA is going to be very good at a lot of things, and that is why America is so successful.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>But Taiwan is the Jamaica of semiconductors, the USA of NBA talent. It is like what Malcolm Gladwell said about running talent in Jamaica - there is a system set up around it.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>On average, Taiwan had one large foundry per 1,000 square kilometers, making it the leading region in foundry density globally.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>And then for the economics behind building the fabs, so TSMC goes to great lengths to accommodate Apples product rollout, which is fair enough when they represent about a quarter of their revenue, so what&#8217;s the economics and numbers look like behind building a fab that&#8217;s likely to be dedicated to a sole customer?&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Semiconductor fabs are all about depreciation. 70% of the cost of a wafer is depreciation. Soon as you finish the fab and it starts working, the capital equipment inside starts to depreciate.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Depreciation is an accounting metric that attempts to replicate the ongoing expense of maintenance&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>CapEx is expense that kills foundries because that&#8217;s cash out the door that won&#8217;t get paid back until later.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>What the financial analyst likes in me is to see something what is happening with Global Foundries, when the company is showing very high cash generation because all the capEx had already been invested previously&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Once the equipment is fully depreciated, then suddenly the company looks super profitable&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The reality of course is that the depreciation exists for a reason&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>You got to keep investing in the machines so that they produce at a very high rate&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>TSMC poured $9 billion to start a new fab for Apple.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>It is a huge financial risk for the foundry to start a new fab.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>But I think it&#8217;s actually a financial risk that TSMC is more than willing to do. It&#8217;s actually a slam dunk.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>How many Apples are there?&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>You have a partner who is willing to work with you at the leading edge. Like how AMD and GlobalFoundries had been&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Now TSMC is starting to do the same for Intel and it&#8217;s interesting to see how that relationship is going to turn out.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Forgive me for asking a dumb question, but could you explain how TSMC adds value compared to ASML who provides the machines to fab? There&#8217;s the description that&nbsp; ASML sells the pots - TSMC sells the cooking, how accurate is that?</p><ul><li><p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a dumb question. I get a lot of comments saying like &#8220;Well ASML is a European company&#8221; and they are the only ones making EUV. Why are we selling them to TSMC? Why aren&#8217;t we making a European fab?</p></li><li><p>The answer is that lithography is by far the most expensive part of the process, but it is not the only one.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>The fallacy is presuming the most expensive equipment is the most proportional important one.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>There&#8217;s other equipment involved in the process. And it needs to be sourced from all over. For instance, the wafers come from Japan, the masks from Japan, the packaging services are in Taiwan, and so on. Applied Materials is in the United States.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Competitors and the landscape</h2></li></ul><ul><li><p>Could you talk a little about TSMC&#8217;s supply chain and their relationship with ASML? Are you worried at all about TSMC&#8217;s reliance and dependance on ASML?</p><div id="youtube2-CFsn1CUyXWs" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;CFsn1CUyXWs&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CFsn1CUyXWs?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><ul><li><p>ASML and TSMC work closely together. They have worked together ever since ASML was part of Philips.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>You can do N7 without EUV, but you won&#8217;t do it profitably. It&#8217;s a science project. And you can&#8217;t do N5 and so on at all.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>But what is the terror case here? That ASML decides that they will only sell to Intel and not sell to TSMC?&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>I reckon that&#8217;s not going to happen unless there&#8217;s a geopolitical incident.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>I think there is a possibility that Canon or Nikon - mostly Nikon I think - break through to EUV and whatever is beyond that&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>TSMC recently announced a $44 billion CAPEX plan, competitors have announced similar spending plans, are we heading for a glut?</p><ul><li><p>Recently, Intel has been doing a lot of committed spending - $20 billion for an Ohio site with possible $100 billion commitment&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>It&#8217;s hard to not say that we won&#8217;t be in a glut at some point. Especially as the economy starts to slow down and interest rates rise.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>But that does not mean that you guys are going to see cheaper GPUs. I keep getting comments about that. Talk to Nvidia.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>But I think TSMC sees the situation as a net benefit for them, because they tend to want market share over profitability&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>They&#8217;ll set the market on fire and they know they can take the heat because again - their capital base is solid&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>When the crash happens then they&#8217;ll buy nonprofitable capacity off the losers&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Is it naive to think that Intel can catch up just by spending about the same amount as TSMC? How else can Intel catch up to TSMC?</p><ul><li><p>Intel and TSMC had never really competed together before, mostly because they seemed to have played in different circles.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Intel and TSMC have been friendly. Andy Grove was one of Morris Chang&#8217;s first customers and Intel patiently worked with TSMC to make it happen&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Samsung has always been TSMC&#8217;s biggest competitor. It is the company that actually is willing to steal talents - and has - and can splash out money like no other company</p><ul><li><p>Samsung has ambitions too. They spread out and about&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Taiwan used to have a substantial memory and display LCD panel business and Samsung took all that away from them. Samsung Electronics has been around since the 1990s and they will continue to compete</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Intel has been working on its foundry, but it&#8217;s hard to make sense of what to do about it until we start seeing some revenue come into the books.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>If they break it out into a real segment and we start seeing it take share from TSMC and GlobalFoundries and Samsung then we can look back and say, &#8220;wow they were not talking out of their butts&#8221;&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>And it will make me look exceptionally stupid.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>So Never doubt a $75 billion company&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>But right now, I tick off a bunch of reasons why Intel&#8217;s Custom Foundry work won&#8217;t work:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>The EDA tool integrations are not ready yet and Intel has generally done what it has done by itself.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Intel has squeezed a lot out of its design-manufacturing integration. Are they the best GPU designer? The best CPU designer? Are they the best manufacturer? They will need to be both.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Let&#8217;s say TSMC enables AWS to make Graviton3s and so on that are SO good that Intel finally starts losing substantial share in the server business.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Foundry is a service business and Intel has never done that sort of thing before. Taiwan has a Japan-like flavor in the sense that they really do customer service. Broad generalization</p></li><li><p>And of course, what to make about the rumors that Intel is going to use TSMC&#8217;s N3 process? How can Intel sell foundry services to their customers while using another foundry for the leading edge?</p></li></ul></li><li><p>But I think it&#8217;s just as likely that Intel Foundry ends up something like GlobalFoundries,&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Which right now runs at an 84% utilization rate, as compared to TSMC and UMC&#8217;s 95%, in 2020. And is losing a lot of money despite hundreds of millions of dollars of government subsidies&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The majority of their wafer volume comes out of Singapore due to their Chartered acquisition in 2009</p></li><li><p>Each year, they are selling wafers at a cheaper price, because each year the competition is coming up behind them&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Culture-wise, I think TSMC is a very aggressive company. You work long hours. You work day and night.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>TSMC gets away with it because they pay pretty good and Taiwanese labor laws are pretty weak&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>But also because people work like hell for it because you are literally part of the Silicon Sacred Mountain. The Silicon Shield.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Intel doesn&#8217;t have that status in the US. Which is why when a guy on Glassdoor writes that &#8220;TSMC will have to change to an eight-hour work day five days a week or run three days on, four days off, three days off, four days on&#8221;. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s on the table.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Are you worried at all that TSMC has all their eggs in one basket? The China threat has been talked about into the ground, but even another event like the 1999 Jiji earthquake could totally halt production. I know you&#8217;ve mentioned how the clean rooms are elevated, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s crazy to say that TSMC is probably THE most important company in the global supply chain, so how are they mitigating these risks?&nbsp;</p><div id="youtube2-MNKF21B01NQ" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;MNKF21B01NQ&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MNKF21B01NQ?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><ul><li><p>The company has put a lot of effort into earthquake amelioration.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>They work with the government to predict when an earthquake will happen so that the fabs get enough time to shut things down&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>And they&#8217;re diversified across Taiwan too. You got multiple fabs in Taichung, Tainan (where my family is from), Kaohsiung, Miaoli, Baoshan.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Most of the worst earthquakes have been in Nantou, Yilan, Hualien</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>The fact of the matter is that Taiwan won&#8217;t let TSMC move its best people, equipment, or facilities off-island.</strong>&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>I don&#8217;t think a fab in the US really ameliorates for the risk. Taiwan&#8217;s fabs are doing over ten million wafers a year. You think two or three more fabs in Texas, Ohio and Arizona doing even 50,000 wafers - which would be big - are going to fill that need? That they can ramp up as fast in time?&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>I read a comment on HackerNews that said that the United States should maintain as much capacity in the US as Taiwan, just in case.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>That&#8217;s something like 1.1 million 12-inch wafers a month to make up. Intel alone does 880K 8-inch wafers a month.</p><ul><li><p>12 inch wafers are roughly twice the size of 8 inch wafers. Maybe more.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>So TSMC is over twice as big as Intel in terms of scale. I&#8217;ve never heard of a physical manufacturing company tripling its capacity at that size -&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>And according to that comment, the capacity is just going to sit there doing nothing waiting. It&#8217;s depreciating and many of this equipment doesn&#8217;t make financial sense unless it&#8217;s being used 100% of the time</p></li><li><p>Everyone is running on a financial tightrope here. You cannot subsidize all of it&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>So I think TW is fine for something up to a 8.0. Nothing can be done about something like a 10.0 earthquake.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Is Apple being their biggest customer a risk? Whilst building your own fab is a massive investment, and technically very difficult, Apple is probably one of the few companies with the resources to do so. Anything to be worried about?</p><ul><li><p>I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s the biggest risk. Apple anchors TSMC&#8217;s customer base. Without Apple I do not think TSMC gets to be the giant that it is today.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>So yes there is a failure mode where Apple one day announces they will second source M1 chips from Samsung or Intel and TSMC stock will take a massive hit&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Losing any one of these core chip customers - AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm, MediaTek - will hit the stock hard but Apple most of all</p></li></ul></li><li><p>But at the same time, I think Apple and TSMC work very closely together - and it is hard to step off that treadmill when you are on it&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Apple and TSMC get to work together and define the PDK - the process development kit&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>This is called <a href="https://www.synopsys.com/silicon/tcad/dtco.html">Design Technology Co-Optimization</a> and it&#8217;s really really tight. Like literally, TSMC engineers will tell Apple engineers, &#8220;You can&#8217;t arrange these logic gates this way because of this FinFet misalignment&#8221; and the Apple engineers will say, &#8220;Okay we will draw the gates elsewhere&#8221;.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Something bad has to happen and it has to be really bad&nbsp;<br></p><div id="youtube2-SP7PMmetpyw" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;SP7PMmetpyw&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SP7PMmetpyw?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><ul><li><p>I said in a previous video that TSMC is always going to try to get a new process ready for Apple for a new iPhone. I think that&#8217;s less the case now because TSMC&#8217;s N3 is late, 2.5 years rather than 2 years, and it is going to miss the iPhone and even maybe the iPad.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>But TSMC is still Apple&#8217;s exclusive fab. Because the two are working so closely together that it is hard to separate now</p></li></ul></li><li><p>I don&#8217;t think Apple can build its own semiconductor fabs.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>They are already moving towards more of that system integrator Boeing model, where they pick and choose suppliers and make money from services and users of their ecosystem.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>I think TSMC has been searching for another client that is going to sit alongside Apple at the leading edge - that used to be Huawei. Now it is probably going to be Intel</p><ul><li><p>I don&#8217;t think Apple will leave TSMC because of Intel, after all they were competing head on with Huawei, but maybe AMD will lower their business with TSMC because of it.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-introduces-game-changing-exynos-2200-processor-with-xclipse-gpu-powered-by-amd-rdna-2-architecture">AMD and Samsung working together</a> for an Exynos chip I think is pretty interesting. And it makes me wonder which came first.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>TSMC is probably going to play AMD and Intel off each other for a little bit.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>If Intel thinks they can just shift those N3 wafers back in-house, maybe TSMC can give the whole fab capacity to AMD? Who knows. But that&#8217;s good capacity and someone will take it.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Misc</h2></li></ul><ul><li><p>Is Moore's Law really dead?&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Moore&#8217;s Law was never a Law of course. It&#8217;s a pace-setter - like those electric rabbits in the dog race - for the industry to continue pushing technological progress forward.&nbsp;But it is getting harder.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>It is interesting to see that starting in 2000 and 2001, the return on investment for capital build up in the overall semiconductor industry started to decline&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Total assets stopped growing and it sorta peaked for a few decades.&nbsp;Installed capacity stopped growing and peaked&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>I see two reasons for that:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>First the dot com bubble popped and the economy fell into a big recession&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Second, that is when 193 nm ARF lasers started to hitting the market, and these DUV machines represented a generational change that shook out a lot of customers&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Yet the semi space is so rich and so money heavy that you can afford to throw smart people and cash at the problem until it goes away.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>I am about to say a bunch of very abstract things off the top of my head so forgive me for being wrong in the details. But for the first thirty or so years of the industry - the pathway to a faster chip was simple&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>You needed more transistors - more gates switching on and off.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>So the industry was like, yeah just squeeze the gates together more and more. Conceptually simple.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>But that stopped being the case at around the 32 nanometer node.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The scientists realized that they should make better gates rather than denser gates. So they introduced FinFet at N22 and N16</p></li><li><p>The laser lithography situation got hard when 193 topped out with 193i and EUV hit delays. So they overlaid 193i over and over again, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 times until EUV came about.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The semiconductor industry drives forward not necessarily because some dude 45 years ago said so, but because people want faster, better looking games. Because software programmers write crappy software and they just assume the chips will get faster and can run it. Because everyone is working on the cloud. So on.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>So long as the market is going to reward an electronics product for being better, the semiconductor industry will push forward</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>You&#8217;ve mentioned how TSMC is very open, except when it comes to their fabs. Compare this to ASML who are extremely open with their research findings, any theories as to why TSMC is so secretive when it comes to their fabs?</p><ul><li><p>ASML is very open about their conceptual research, but they are never going to tell you how they actually put it together.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>That&#8217;s where the trade secret is&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Also, the optics stuff is just way too hard for any human to comprehend.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>TSMC is a conceptually simple company. They make and sell wafers.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Their trade secret is their fab and it used to be that you can read white papers about how that stuff works.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>How the automated systems works&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>What they focused on</p></li><li><p>How the recipes are kinda there&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>But that&#8217;s gone now. Samsung and SMIC have taught them a very nasty lesson about what it means to be too open&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Basically you are not going to find anything about their operations or work styles anything past 2010.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The best thing I know of is <a href="https://english.cw.com.tw/article/article.action?id=2272">this article in the CommonWealth</a>, and it discusses how the fabs are more automated than ever before. Where they use large data sets to help optimize recipes and operations</p><ul><li><p>So it kind of makes sense to me then that we don&#8217;t hear about how TSMC works and optimizes - because nobody really knows&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Q4 earnings&nbsp;</h2><ul><li><p>So a while ago, I had been looking at TSMC and seeing it be so highly valued felt strange to me. TSMC right now has a $650 billion market cap. This is the 9th or 8th most valuable company in the world. Why?</p><ul><li><p>The company is simple to value&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The company is simple to predict revenues - let&#8217;s talk more on that later&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>People perceive it to have scale, which it does, and that it has a monopoly, which I would argue that it doesn&#8217;t.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>A quirk of the market? Everyone in Taiwan buys TSMC stock. And they never sell. If you think bitcoin is full of HODL, you haven&#8217;t seen Taiwanese aunties.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>This really smart analyst named <a

But since then, CATL has pulled ahead of LG and is now the largest EV battery provider. And I think CATL&#8217;s lithium ion iron technology seems to be pulling ahead in the market - with Tesla <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/20/tesla-switching-to-lfp-batteries-in-all-standard-range-cars.html">adopting it for all their standard range cars</a>.  </p><div><hr></div><p>As electric vehicles gain popularity around the world, people are starting to pay closer attention to the batteries going into those EVs. A recent report by the Biden administration singles out large capacity EV batteries as one of four critical industries worth further scrutiny. </p><p>Asian-based companies are driving substantial technical progress here. In a prior video, I profiled CATL Group, the world's largest EV battery company by shipments. While they are indeed growing very quickly, CATL's leading position is almost entirely defined by its dominance in the China market. Outside of China, the situation is very different. </p><p>In this video, I want to look at another battery market leader, one with considerable strength outside of China. What had once been LG Chem, but is now called LG Energy Solution. </p><h2>About LG and LG Chem </h2><p>The company that would eventually create LG Chem and LG Energy Solution was founded in 1947 as Lak-hui Chemical Industries. Pronounced "lucky". </p><p>The company at first sold creams and other hygienics products. When a large number of its creams were returned due to a faulty plastic lid, the company started making plastics to help solve a problem of their own. </p><p>1958 saw the establishment of the Goldstar Company, an electronics outfit. Goldstar made radios and home appliances and would eventually grow into one of the country's largest electronics companies. </p><p>Lucky and Goldstar eventually merged in 1983 to create Lucky-Goldstar, or LG. </p><p>In the 1970s, Lak-hui entered the petrochemical business. They were soon making carpet, wallpaper, pipes, toothbrushes, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and more. </p><p>Pretty much everything. This sort of product expansion is not all that unusual for a chaebol. </p><p>As you might expect, LG Chem found itself doing too much and its product lineup needed some re-organization. Thus over the years, LG Chem has spun off various sister companies to handle certain products. </p><p>Its consumer brands went to LG Household and Health Care in 2001. Some of its pharmaceuticals division went to LG Life Sciences in 2002. Its carpet and wallpaper products went to LG Hausys in 2009. </p><p>So up until very recently, LG Chem&#8217;s product lineup was largely three categories: Petrochemicals like the thermoplastic ABS, electronics chemicals like those used for LCD screens, and the battery business. </p><p>Then in late 2020, LG Chem decided that it would spin-off its battery division into a new wholly owned company called LG Energy Solution. The goal was to single out the battery division as one of their core businesses and help it raise money on its own to fund its substantial capital investments. </p><h2>LG Chem and Batteries </h2><p>LG Chem began working on lithium ion batteries all the way back in 1995. As a diversified chemicals company, LG Chem saw an opportunity to leverage their chemical expertise to gain share in the battery space. After all, batteries are basically chemistry.</p><p>The company started out making batteries for cell phones and laptops, but for a decade they eyed the lucrative automobile market. In the 2000s, exclusively electric vehicles were not common. You were more likely to find hybrids like the Prius V, released from 2011 to 2012. Those cars were driven by nickel metal hyride batteries. </p><p>At the time, lithium ion batteries had significant cost, abuse tolerance, and calendar life concerns at high temperatures. But in turn they offered the potential of higher energy densities. </p><p>LG Chem wanted to develop a lithium ion battery not only good enough for hybrids but also entirely electric vehicles. For twenty years, the company's battery business gained infamy for being an endlessly loss-making enterprise. </p><p>But their long march eventually bore fruit. In 2009, GM selected LG to supply lithium ion batteries for their Chevrolet Volt electric vehicle, a huge breakthrough. </p><p>Since then, lithium ion battery costs have fallen very quickly. This has in part fueled the increasing economic viability of electric vehicles around the world. Today, while nickel metal hyride batteries are still sometimes used in hybrids, most EVs have lithium ion batteries. LG has been a leading beneficiary of this trend. </p><p>In part due to its ties to the chemical industrial complex, LG Chem is very vertically integrated. They spend a lot on research and development. Then leverage their supply chain to rapidly adopt and manufacture any promising new battery chemistries. </p><p>In 2001, they established their own technology center in Troy, Michigan to study battery components alongside the American car manufacturers. </p><p>The company is very globalized. LG has been willing to export its technologies abroad and build factories outside of South Korea. This has been very much necessary when it comes to the EV battery industry. </p><p>With laptop and cellphone components like batteries or semiconductors, they are small enough that you can manufacture them at home in Korea or China before shipping them abroad. This encourages companies to centralize manufacturing, which is how you get to a situation where something like half the world's chips are made in Taiwan. </p><p>But such a thing is not logistically and economically feasible for EVs because their batteries are so heavy. With automobile supply chains being as complicated as they are, manufacturers will often demand that battery factories be built near where the vehicle is assembled. </p><p>In 2010, LG Chem spent $300 million to build a 650,000 square foot battery factory in the American city of Holland in west Michigan. This one serves General Motors and their Chevrolet Bolt. </p><p>In the years since, they have built two more factories in China and another in Poland, the latter completed in 2017. These are in addition to their core facilities in Korea, which serve Hyundai Motors. </p><h2>Product Analysis: Cells in Packs</h2><p>Fully integrated lithium ion battery packs like the ones that go into your Tesla or Chevrolet Bolt are made up of cells. Lithium battery cells are made up of four different components. </p><p>The first two are the cathode and anode, the electrodes in an EV battery. Current flows from the two electrodes to an outside system. There is a separator. A porous membrane that keeps the cathode and anode from mixing with one another. And finally, there is an electrolyte that facilitates the flow of electrons back and forth between the cathode and the anode. </p><p>Usually, cells are first bundled into modules before being installed into the pack. Depending on their size and form, there can be thousands of these cells and modules going into a single pack. </p><p>Traditionally, cells can come in three different forms: Cylindrical, prismatic and pouch-type. For EVs, LG offers cylindrical batteries and pouches. They do also make prismatic batteries, but not for EVs. </p><p>Let us start with a cylindrical type battery cell. You might be familiar with how these are shaped. The kind of things you might stick into your Bluetooth mouse. The size and shape are more standardized, and you can tell between them based on their name. </p><p>For instance, the 18650. The first four digits indicate their size. 18 millimeters wide and 65 millimeters long. The 0 at the end tells you that it is a cylindrical battery. </p><p>Many Chinese EV companies as well as Tesla use these cells for their battery packs. The ones Tesla uses are 4680s, which are 46 millimeters wide and 80 millimeters long. Not sure why they dropped the 0 at the end. </p><p>A company like Tesla is likely putting thousands of these cylindrical cells into their packs. And this can get immensely challenging. Thousands of cells means thousands of things to place and weld without making mistakes. </p><p>Tesla learned how to do it but most car companies are not going to want to deal with that. So that is where the second type of cell comes into play: Prismatic cells. </p><p>Prismatic is a fancy word that means "highly varied". So the defining characteristic of these large-format prismatic battery cells is that they are custom. So as a result you do not have to put thousands of them into a battery pack. Rather, just hundreds or even dozens. </p><p>Many traditional car companies have preferred to go with prismatic battery cells. It works since the vendor is basically customizing the product to best fit their manufacturing and product needs. The drawback is the supply chain. Because it is custom, it is hard to dual-source for volume and dependency reasons. </p><p>The third type of battery is a pouch type, a more minimalist type cell contained in a flexible foil. Literally a bag of chemicals. </p><p>Because they are flat, thin and light, you can stuff them to the max into the battery pack. This gives the packs a very high energy density. And since they are in a bag, when safety issues occur, the pouch can swell rather than explode. </p><p>Pouch type battery cells are one of LG's core EV products. Two of their most prominent proprietary innovations are used for this pouch type battery: Their stack-and-fold cell technology and a safety reinforced separator or SRS. </p><p>Stack and fold describes a patented way of manufacturing their polymer pouch battery cells. This technique stacks the anode, separator and cathode together and laminates them into what is called a "bi-cell". The bi-cells are then folded into the battery. Stack and fold. There we go. </p><p>The second major thing is the safety reinforced separator or SRS, a patented type of separator. The separator if you recall, separates the anode from the cathode. Damage to it can cause damage to the battery and might even spark a fire. </p><p>In LG's SRS, a ceramic coating is applied that acts to provide superior abuse tolerance and stability across a variety of thermal and nail penetration scenarios. In other words, the SRS hopefully creates an overall safer battery. </p><h2>Customers and Competitors </h2><p>Due to its early mover and technical advantages, LG Energy has garnered an impressive range of customers. And competitors. </p><p>General Motors or GM is one of their best customers. They have been working together ever since the aforementioned Chevy Bolt. As GM moves closer towards a fully electric lineup, LG is adding two more American battery factories in Lordstown, Ohio and Spring Hill, Tennessee to help meet demand. </p><p>Those factories - both located near GM facilities - are scheduled to be completed in 2022 and 2023. </p><p>The Lordstown plant is estimated to cost $2.3 billion USD. Interestingly enough, they are both 50-50 joint ventures, hinting at some sort of technology transfer.</p><p>Out in Europe, the company supplies batteries to Daimler, Audi, and Volkswagen. Volkswagen had been one of LG Energy's larger customers, but the company recently announced a switch away from pouch-type cells to prismatic cells. The transition will probably take a long time, but it is a big deal. </p><p>In China, LG is one of Tesla's EV battery suppliers alongside China&#8217;s CATL, with plans to compete for a larger share of that business in the rest of the world. </p><p>They also formed a joint venture with Chinese automaker Geely on battery tech. This factory is in Nanjing and opened for business in 2020. </p><p>On the competitor side, LG faces some big players. In its native Korea, the company faces competition from Samsung SDI and SK Innovation. Both are backed by massive chaebol. SK also makes pouch style cells, while Samsung mostly makes prismatic cells. </p><p>LG and SK recently settled a fierce trade secret lawsuit over their battery technologies for $1.8 billion. It had threatened SK's ability to progress forward in the United States. </p><p>This had been a very big deal since SK will be supplying batteries for Ford's F-150 Lightning. Perhaps one of the most important upcoming EVs, the Lightning is the electric version of the country's best selling vehicle. I am glad to see the lawsuit resolved because it looks to be a great truck. </p><p>Outside of Korea, Japan&#8217;s Panasonic is one of LG's biggest rivals. Their global market share ex-China as of this writing is second only to LG. But most of that substantial volume is driven by two major customers: Toyota and Tesla. </p><p>Panasonic is Tesla's partner in the Nevada Gigafactory. </p><p>Probably LG's fiercest competitor would be CATL. They are expected to be the number one beneficiary of Volkswagen's switch away from pouch type batteries to prismatic. </p><p>Their recently developed cell to pack technology skips having to place battery cells into modules before loading them into the pack. As a result, the pack gets lighter, denser, and cheaper. It's a big deal and puts CATL's prismatic offerings on par with LG's pouch cells. And CATL is starting to build capacity internationally too. LG will have to adjust their lineup and up their game. </p><h2>Conclusion </h2><p>Despite the fierce competition, LG Energy Solution has an energetic future ahead of it. The unit turned losses for a decade, but strong EV battery demand worldwide finally pushed it solidly into the green in 2020. Since then, the company has started to generate very real profits. </p><p>In Q1 2021, the latest results that I have as of this writing, LG Energy Solution generated record revenues and profits. Revenues were up 88% year over year, making it a $15 billion USD run rate business. </p><p>Operating profit was 341 billion won or $310 million USD. Profit margin was 8%. LG Energy Solution is no cash-rich SaaS company, but considering all the revenue growth as well as the challenges of manufacturing actual things it is now solidly profitable. </p><p>One can argue that they should be spending even more so to secure their market position. But it seems like the focus on profit generation is for the upcoming IPO, which as of this writing has yet to happen. The company wants to raise some 10 trillion won or $9 billion USD, valuing it at 100 trillion won or $90 billion USD. Institutional investors will want to know if this business can make money. </p><p>Whether an auto supplier making just about a billion dollars annualized profit and wrestling with massive competitors - some of whom are implicitly state backed - is worth $90 billion USD is up for debate. I will leave that determination to you. But it does demonstrate the company's value and outsized importance in an extremely dynamic and world-changing future industry.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://asianometry.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share The Asianometry Newsletter&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://asianometry.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share The Asianometry Newsletter</span></a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Billionaire Speed Run]]></title><description><![CDATA[Colin Huang and Pinduoduo]]></description><link>https://asianometry.substack.com/p/the-billionaire-speed-run</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://asianometry.substack.com/p/the-billionaire-speed-run</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jon Y]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jan 2022 17:00:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/uwWBbTy79vU" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Author&#8217;s note: The video is below</em></p><div id="youtube2-uwWBbTy79vU" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;uwWBbTy79vU&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uwWBbTy79vU?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p><em>Right now, Pinduoduo is a $100 billion company.

Three years later it IPO'ed. His shares in that company? Worth $14 billion. Then the value of those shares doubled. </p><p>Colin Huang began selling his shares in 2020. He stepped down from being CEO and took up the chairman position. Then in March 2021, he stepped down from that too, retiring completely. As of this writing, Bloomberg says he is worth $45 billion, the world's 30th richest person. </p><p>In this video, I want to talk about a guy who got very rich, very fast. And then he got out just as fast. I have never seen anything like it. </p><p>## Beginnings </p><p>Colin Huang was born in 1980 to two factory workers in Hangzhou. Like fellow tech titan Jack Ma, Colin Huang came from a humble background. He did very well at school and earned a spot to the prestigious Hangzhou Foreign Languages School. </p><p>The HFLS is one of China's best schools, and 20% of its students are exempted from taking the big college exam that haunt most Chinese high school students. They just go straight to a top university. Fellow alumni include Xi Jinping's only child Xi Mingze. </p><p>After studying computer science at the prestigious Zhejiang University, he moved to the United States to earn a masters at the University of Wisconsin. </p><p>There, William Ding, the billionaire founder of NetEase, connected him to billionaire Duan Yongping. Duan is probably most well known in America (if at all) for paying $620,000 for a lunch with Warren Buffett. But in 1995, Duan founded BBK Electronics. </p><p>BBK is the world's largest smartphone vendor and the company behind Vivo, Oppo, and Realme. Americans might know it better for being the company behind the OnePlus smartphone brand. </p><p>Duan founded BBK but soon retired to be an investor. And after Colin's graduation in 2004, Duan encouraged him to join a small startup called Google. </p><p>## Colin in Google </p><p>Colin had offers from Microsoft and IBM but turned them down to join Google as an intern. After two years there as a programmer and then product manager, he was sent to his homeland to work on Google China. </p><p>He did his best, but Google China failed to gain traction against Baidu. The company was too inflexible to adapt to local traditions. Colin would have to fly to California to get the founders to sign off on minor changes like the size of the Chinese font. This frustrated him. </p><p>Regardless, he had good things to say about his experience at Google: </p><p>&gt; Google&#8217;s &#8220;do not be evil&#8221; goes deep into its genes, putting its mission and values &#8203;&#8203;before profit, and profit is just a by-product of doing the right thing</p><p>He resigned in 2007. His Google shares would be worth millions of dollars after the search engine's IPO. Seeing the effects of such sudden wealth had on early Google employees made an impact on him - "Too much money in an instant." </p><p>Colin was already a rich man by then but he had ambitions to create something greater. You already got the sense that this was a guy who saw wealth as a pathway to something else. </p><p>## Starting Pinduoduo</p><p>Over the next few years Colin started a number of small businesses. The first was an e-commerce site called Ouko that sold consumer electronics. After that was a Taobao marketing firm. Then after that, a RPG WeChat games company. The latter two were sold for a pretty sum. </p><p>Upon selling those companies, Colin fell into a funk trying to figure out what to do next. He began studying Alibaba and Tencent, he noticed that the two companies did not cross paths with one another. Tencent dominated social media and gaming, but could not sell physical goods to its consumers. Alibaba knew how to sell such goods, but it could not foster community amongst its users. </p><p>The two companies did not get how the other made money. Huang decided to mash his two experiences together - gaming and e-commerce - to create the gamified shopping experience that is Pinduoduo or PDD. He raised $8 million from Duan Yongping, William Ding, and other angel investors. Pinduoduo was launched in April 2015. </p><p>## How Pinduoduo Works </p><p>Colin built Pinduoduo as a game. This was not an accident. The shopfront has colorful photos and hidden bargains to stimulate that feeling of deal hunting  Kind of like how customers go to Costco to see what might be on the show floor, Pinduoduo features new things every day to get users to keep coming back. </p><p>The discounts are steep, but at the same time you cannot get them without a little work of your own. If you want to buy a box of mangoes for $1.50, then you have to convince your family and friends to join in on the fun. </p><p>These "group discounts" echo Groupon, but are different in that they are more social and localized. Groupon needs only a number of people in an area to purchase the discount for the offer to "unlock". Like, 35,000 coupon purchases for a massage. For Pinduoduo, you join "circles" of local friends, acquaintances, and family to get your cheap box of mangoes. </p><p>The company very heavily leverages Tencent's social network. Friends can see what their friends have purchased or reviewed. You share your deals through WeChat. At the start, Pinduoduo almost entirely existed within WeChat. </p><p>Naturally, Tencent is one of Pinduoduo's investors. Though they seem to have a weird relationship. Colin has said that Tencent does not really support Pinduoduo other than as an ordinary financial investor - neither particularly good or bad to them: </p><p>&gt; Recently, there was an incident that made me feel very wronged. There were a lot of rumors that Pinduoduo was scamming. The rumors were widely spread through WeChat groups. I asked WeChat for help but was rejected ... I can understand, because if WeChat stands up to help me deal with the rumors, the masses will say it is because Tencent is our shareholder ... </p><p>&gt; If I die, Tencent won't die. Tencent has thousands of sons. </p><p>I like that last bit. Unlike Meituan's Wang Xing, who seems to prefer historical metaphors, Colin Huang speaks in floral Chinese poetry. </p><p>The company has started to guide its customers away from WeChat to its own dedicated mobile app. Some 50% of their transactions now take place there. </p><p>## Speed Running Pinduoduo</p><p>In just four months, Pinduoduo had 10 million users. By February 2016, less than a year after launch, the company had over 20 million paying users. Just five months later, the company had 100 million. </p><p>They raised $100 million that same year. In just 21 months, the company would be worth over a billion dollars. In April 2018, they raised $3 billion. And then just three months later in July 2018, the company raised $1.6 billion on the US NASDAQ exchange at a valuation of $60 billion. </p><p>That's three years from nothing to IPO and a $60 billion valuation. Few companies have gone from literal start to American IPO so fast. </p><p>Facebook stayed private for eight years. AirBnb took 12 years. Alibaba took 15 years. It is kind of nuts. </p><p>As you might expect, Pinduoduo's speed has had real and concerning consequences.</p><p>## Product Quality</p><p>One has to do with the quality of its goods. The company targeted residents in third and fourth tier cities. People living in metropolises that nobody has ever heard of. </p><p>These people are extremely price sensitive and Pinduoduo embraces that spirit wholeheartedly. Colin likes to describe his customers as being unknowable to the elites on Beijing&#8217;s Fifth Ring Road - a reference to the city&#8217;s business districts. </p><p>The company wants to deliver good cost value for its customers. Even if a bag of Lay&#8217;s potato chips arrives at the customer&#8217;s home with half of the chips broken (and a few weeks late), they would consider that a success. Because the other half arrived intact and the customer had paid so little. </p><p>This blas&#233; attitude has led to a product quality problem on the company's platform. Business websites have noted that Pinduoduo is ranked first in the e-commerce industry in terms of complaints.</p><p>The company also has issues with trademark infringement and fakes on the platform. One of their best selling products is a $4 bottle of aphrodisiac, with over 4 million units sold. Soon after the company IPO'ed, they were sued for imitation products. In response, they removed thousands of stores and millions of listings. This in turn pissed off a lot of manufacturers, who made threats against Pinduoduo employees. </p><p>For what is worth, when you search for Pinduoduo in Baidu one of the most common suggested searches are: "How to unbind the bank card with Pinduoduo", "How to cancel Pinduoduo", and "How to close Pinduoduo." </p><p>## Working Life </p><p>The second concern has to do with the structure and operating conditions of the company itself. For a guy who portrays himself in the media as being thoughtful and considerate of the working man, he sure works his people extremely hard. </p><p>The company pays more than your average startup. They recruited talent from Alibaba and JD.com with offers of up to 60% higher than their current salary. But they work them hard too, leading to a new twist to the company's motto: "The more you strive, the more you earn." </p><p>Being in such a hurry to a billion dollars has had consequences for Pinduoduo&#8217;s employees. In January 2021, a 22-year old collapsed and died on her way back from work at 1:30 AM. To be fair, a lot of people work long hours and it does not literally kill them. But the incident served as a lighting rod for criticism of the company's 996 working schedule. </p><p>Soon thereafter, a 15-minute video by ex-Pinduoduo front end developer Wang Taixu accused the company of forcing employees to work over 300 hours a month. Wang also said he was fired after sharing a video of an ambulance coming to collect an employee for over-working. </p><p>Pinduoduo for their part said that Wang was fired for making "extreme remarks". In other words, the guy is a crazy liar. Some Chinese netizens attempted to cancel Pinduoduo with their own "delete PDD" campaign but the company has soldiered on. </p><p>A few days later, an employee in Changsha committed suicide by jumping off a building to his death. The employee had been on probation but scored well enough to be retained by the company. He had booked a return flight to Shanghai. </p><p>996 is tied to other, less savory aspects of Chinese working life. I know that. But it shows that there are still substantial challenges to be addressed at Pinduoduo both in and outside the company. It is a real funny time for its founder to be stepping away. </p><p>## Conclusion and Retirement </p><p>In his 2017 Bloomberg profile, Colin was already hinting at an early retirement. The article offhandedly mentions at the end that he would not be working there forever. He cites his admiration for how Benjamin Franklin retired from business at the age of 40 to focus on science and politics. </p><p>Colin also has a role model to follow. His friend and mentor Duan Yongping, who left BBK at a relatively young age to invest and now resides in the United States. </p><p>Of course, lots of people think out aloud about retiring with extreme wealth but few actually go through with it. Especially in the West. So Pinduoduo investors were shocked in 2020 when he sold 30% of his shares and stepped down from his leadership positions in the company. First, the CEO job in 2020 and then the chairmanship a year later. The company lost $50 billion of stock value. </p><p>In his resignation letter, he says that he would be focusing on life sciences and agriculture in his retirement. So far as I can tell, it has had nothing to do with politics or government pressure like in the cases of Jack Ma&#8217;s retirement and ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming&#8217;s resignation. Dude just wants to enjoy his 40 billion dollars. </p><p>But he leaves at a time of great uncertainty for the company. Pinduoduo faces massive challenges. In addition to the aforementioned product quality complaints and internal growing pains, the company is not profitable and spends 60% of its revenue on marketing alone. </p><p>It is also facing fierce competition not only from Alibaba but also the food delivery super-app Meituan. Meituan also has a similarly minded young philosopher-CEO at its helm. But that guy hasn&#8217;t retired from his company.</p><p>Anyway, it is his successor&#8217;s problem now. Best of luck to Colin in his new life. I hope he spends his newfound wealth well. Speed run of a lifetime.</p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://asianometry.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share The Asianometry Newsletter&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://asianometry.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share The Asianometry Newsletter</span></a></p><p></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How the Soviets Put a Lander on Venus ]]></title><description><![CDATA[Surviving Hell]]></description><link>https://asianometry.substack.com/p/how-the-soviets-put-a-lander-on-venus</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://asianometry.substack.com/p/how-the-soviets-put-a-lander-on-venus</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jon Y]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jan 2022 17:00:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/UEmlOjKmL68" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Author&#8217;s note: You can watch the video below</em></p><div id="youtube2-UEmlOjKmL68" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;UEmlOjKmL68&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UEmlOjKmL68?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p><em>I made a follow-up to this video that I never released.

Such things were not available. </em></p><p><em>But over the years, the industry has developed new technologies for handling extreme conditions.</em></p><p><em>Sensors for the aerospace industry for instance. </em></p><p><em>But those have been traditional silicon chips, and they have an upper functional temperature limit about 572 degrees Fahrenheit or 300 degrees Celsius. </em></p><p><em>This is because as temperatures rise, electrons get excited and start flooding the transistors until they cannot turn off. Sadly, 300 degrees Celsius still falls short of Venusian conditions. </em></p><p><em>But there are some entirely different technologies with much higher limits - capable of operating natively for days in Venus-level heat. Those are silicon carbide chips, made of a mix of silicon and carbon. </em></p><p><em>Silicon carbide semiconductors have much higher "flood limits" than traditional silicon - the industry term is "wide-bandgap". NASA recently published a report showing test data from two silicon carbide integrated chips. They successfully operated for 2 months in a pressure chamber replicating Venusian surface conditions. Not just temperature and pressure, but corrosive atmosphere too. </em></p><p><em>Silicon carbide semiconductors are at a very early stage of development. The two NASA chips had 195 transistors each. These are basically 1970s era electronics. But researchers have been able to build a variety of digital circuits - including, crucially, crude transceivers capable of receiving and sending radio signals. </em></p><p><em>Silicon carbide semiconductors have seen stop and start development. Part of this is due to certain manufacturing challenges. It had been difficult to create high-purity silicon carbide crystals for the chip substrates. Another reason has been the dominance of traditional silicon chips. But the industry has started to embrace and overcome those challenges, and development has been recently accelerating. </em></p><p><em>Assuming electronics can be made to fully function in these extreme conditions, big bulky cooling systems and the sources to power them are no longer necessary. It brings new options to the forefront. </em></p><p><em>For instance, how about the idea of sending a silicon carbide based landing probe powered by molten salt batteries and Venusian winds?</em></p><div><hr></div><p>In the 1970s and 80s, the Soviet Union put 5 landers on the surface of Venus and they each survived for over 30 minutes. No one has tried it since. </p><p>From time to time, someone will post to Reddit pictures from the Venera missions and everyone goes "Nice". And yeah it is pretty cool that these pictures exist. But have you ever wondered what it took to build a machine capable of taking those pictures? Like, how did they do it?</p><p>In this video, I want to look at the Venera space series and the engineering behind this stunning achievement. Sit back and enjoy. This is going to be a long one. </p><h2>The Conditions of Venus </h2><p>Let us first talk about Venus. I cannot imagine a harder place to land on anywhere in the Solar System. Okay, maybe the Sun. But Venus comes in second. </p><p>Venus has been called Earth's evil twin. The planet that started off similar to the Earth but eventually went oh so wrong. </p><p>The two planets are close together and are similar in size, but the Venusian atmosphere is as different as it can get from Earth's. This is due to a runaway greenhouse effect that has gone on for who knows how long.  </p><p>The Venusian surface gets hotter than Mercury's: 864 degrees Fahrenheit or 462 Celsius. The surface pressure is equivalent to being over 0.5 miles or a kilometer under water. </p><p>That thick atmosphere presents special challenges. Its clouds are made up of sulfuric acid, used in lead acid batteries and as an industrial cleaner. And you have to survive atmospheric entry, where friction can heat you up to 11,000 degrees Celsius. </p><p>The Americans put a dude on the Moon, but they never tried to put a legit lander on Venus. The Soviets would eventually do it 5 times. </p><p>But I am getting ahead of myself. Let us wind the clock all the way back to 1967. As the year was coming to a close, the Soviets found themselves at a crossroads. </p><h2>Venera 4: A Bigger Boat</h2><p>Eleven launches to Venus. Eleven failures. That was the scorecard going on to Venera 4. </p><p>The mission of the Venera project (Venera is Russian for Venus) was to land a probe on the Venusian surface. With the space race in full swing, the Soviets wanted to outdo the Americans by piercing the Venusian veil. The American capitalists were sending a flyby probe to Venus that was scheduled to arrive in late 1967. Let&#8217;s show them up first. </p><p>For the Soviets, it was now or never. After Venera 3 failed to reach the ground, the whole Venera mission was transferred over to the aerospace company Lavochkin. Venera 4's launch date was set for the autumn 1967 launch window.</p><p>Venera 4 was a hefty thing. It stood 11 feet or 3.5 meters tall. Its bottom lander was essentially a bunch of instruments and a battery wrapped up in a pressure shell with a parachute.</p><p>Venera 4 reached Venus in October 1967 and successfully launched its lander. The mother craft released the probe over the planet and it entered the atmosphere. Temperatures hit 11,000 degrees and entry forces reached 450G. The onboard instruments began analyzing the atmosphere and sending back data. </p><p>The first recorded temperature was 102 degrees Fahrenheit or 39 degrees Celsius. Atmospheric pressure was about the same as that on Earth. </p><p>But both measures began rising. And they kept rising. Quickly. 10 atmospheres. Then 20. It just kept going up. Far higher than anything engineers anticipated. </p><p>93 minutes into the mission, with the probe still over 27 kilometers above the Venusian surface, Venera 4 cracked open - likely near its top - and was crushed. The measurements at crush point showed 22 atmospheres and 530 degrees Fahrenheit or 277 degrees Celsius. </p><p>By now, the American probe Mariner 5 had also reached Venus. It flew past the planet and sent back data on the planet's atmosphere and composition. </p><p>The Soviets and Americans compared their probes' data and came to the conclusion that Venus was a hotter, drier, far more hostile planet than anyone had anticipated. </p><p>As a great American once said, "You're going to need a bigger boat."</p><h2>Venera 5 and 6: Step Forward</h2><p>This realization required intense engineering. But with construction for Venera 5 and 6 already finalized and the 1969 launch date coming up fast, there would be no time to make major changes. Engineers did what they could to strengthen the landing probe and left the radical re-design to the next launch. </p><p>5 and 6 were sent on a mission they were not fully prepared for, and the results were similar. Venera 5 transmitted data for 53 minutes before succumbing to pressures of 27 atmospheres and temperatures of 600 degree Fahrenheit or 320 degrees Celsius. </p><p>Venera 6 lasted for 51 minutes, but it had gotten slightly further. Descending 37.8 kilometers into the atmosphere before also getting crushed. You know what, I am sensing a pattern here. </p><h2>Venera 7: Success</h2><p>With the 1970 launch window, the program directors were determined to make it to the Venusian surface. Whatever it takes. </p><p>And now they knew what it would take. 840 degrees Fahrenheit or 450 degrees Celsius. 100 atmospheres. Burning, corrosive acid. Let's go! </p><p>Venera engineers consulted submarine designers for tips on how to survive deep pressures. They sourced new materials to build it. And they got a hotter, stronger test chamber to test it. </p><p>Engineers wanted to maximize the amount of the time spent on the surface, so they modified the parachute to make the lander fall faster. When temperatures hit 390 degrees Fahrenheit / 200 degrees Celsius, a restricting cord would melt and the thing would fully open up to assure a soft landing. A nifty mechanism. </p><p>The lander was built in the shape of an egg. Made of titanium, its surface was smooth, with as few ports, welds or sub-structures as possible. The inside was lined with shock absorber and an unknown insulation layer. Like with its predecessors, the chamber would pre-chill to freezing temperatures before entry. </p><p>After a 4 month journey, Venera 7 reached the planet on December 1970. It separated from the mother ship and descended into the atmosphere, transmitting data for 35 minutes through the atmosphere. The parachute at first worked as intended. Things seemed smooth. </p><p>But six minutes into stage 2, the chute melted or tore and the probe dropped like a rock. Venera 7 then unexpectedly hit the ground at 35 miles an hour or 60 kilometers an hour - 4:42 AM Venus solar time. </p><p>It hit the Venusian ground (determined to be harder than sand but softer than pumice) after free-falling and bounced. The signal then abruptly seemed to have cut out a second after landing. </p><p>Soviet engineers sadly thought the probe was crushed to bits. But a few months later, radio astronomers reviewing the radio data re-discovered the signal, extremely weak and lost amidst the noise. Incredible luck. </p><p>As it turned out, Venera 7's bounce had misaligned the antenna and caused it to come to rest on its side - weakening the signal to 1 or 3% strength. The probe sat there transmitting data for 23 minutes in temperatures hot enough to melt zinc or lead until its shell cracked and it too melted. </p><p>The data sent by Venera 7 (and Venera 8, a similar design launched two years later in 1972) helped pave the way for a new generation of Venusian probes.</p><h2>Venera 9 and 10: A New Generation </h2><p>It would not be until 1975 that the Soviets launched their next series of Venera probes - 5 years after Venera 7. By then, Soviet engineers now knew what to expect, and designed the two to do more than ever before. And that includes sending back black and white photographs. In fact, that was the probes' primary goal: Send back the first ever photographic panorama of the Venusian surface. </p><p>New rockets developed for propulsion to the Moon and Mars allowed for bigger probes than ever before. Venera 9 and 10 were 5x heavier than their predecessors, weighing 5 tons or 5,000 kilograms at launch in total. </p><p>Venera 9 and 10 had an orbiter and lander component. The entry capsule, the equipment designed to bring the lander to the surface, was a spherical capsule covered in an asbestos composite. It would enter the atmosphere, take the heat, and split into half like a plastic easter egg - ejecting the lander forward to its destination. </p><p>The lander was magnificently designed. The six and a half foot (or 2 meter) tall lander was essentially a hermetically sealed titanium sphere 2.6 feet or 80 centimeters wide with some peripherals attached. That sphere would hold the instruments and was bolted together with gold wire seals. Inside, shelves made of beryllium and electric fans would evenly disperse heat to prevent instrument failure. </p><p>The sphere's inside would be lined with a type of polyurethane foam now forgotten. They then wrapped the whole thing in 5 inches or 12 centimeters of a honeycomb composite insulation AND another layer of titanium. </p><p>On the bottom of the lander, they stuck a shock absorbing ring. </p><p>At the top, titanium disk that kind of looks like a hat. That funky hat would serve as an aerobrake that replaced the two-stage parachute design that so troubled Venera 7. </p><p>The way it works, the parachute entirely detached at 30 miles or 50 kilometers above the surface and the aerobrake does the rest. To see if it worked, Soviet engineers threw it out of an airplane 8.7 miles or 14 kilometers above the ground.</p><p>Two cameras were placed in the middle of the lander so that they can see both the surface and out into the horizon as far as possible. Equipped with goldfish bowl lenses, they were protected with a special pressure window made of pure quartz. The lander sent its image data - 512x128 pixels large - at a rate of one line every 3.5 seconds. </p><p>Maybe they should have set up a Starlink or something. Might have sped things up! </p><p>Scientists estimated with all of this, the entry probe would probably last an hour on the surface. Just one hour. But it would take at least half an hour to send the full panorama, so I guess it was fine. </p><h2>Landing on Venus </h2><p>Late October 1975, Venera 9 and 10 arrived and landed as planned. Their parachutes cut at 50 kilometers as planned and both landers hit the ground at around 15 miles or 25 kilometers per hour. </p><p>Venera 9 landed first. Touching down on a slight slope, maybe a hill or the side of a volcanic crater, and kicking up a bit of dust at landing. </p><p>One of the two cameras succeeded in photographing and transmitting their data. Scientists waited. Slowly, the data trickled in ... revealing our first ever picture of the Venusian surface. What they saw were sharp rocks, soil, and a distant horizon. </p><p>It might have looked like a spot back home, but it wasn&#8217;t. These images traveled to us from a whole different world. </p><p>The sun was shining bright on Venus that day, although obscured by the clouds, and there was a gentle breeze blowing. A pleasant morning. Well, except for the crushing pressures, nearly water-less atmosphere, corrosive acid and 800 degree temperatures. </p><p>Venera 10 landed similarly a few days later but on much more boring terrain. A rolling plain with hardened pieces of magma. These rocks are much older than those Venera 9 saw. The acidic atmosphere has had time to chemically scorch them. </p><p>Both probes transmitted for 50-60 minutes until their orbiters went out of range. At that point, the temperatures inside the probes' measured about 140 degrees Fahrenheit or 60 degrees Celsius. They could have kept going. When they actually died, we don&#8217;t know. The orbiters themselves later burned up in the atmosphere once they completed their mission. </p><p>Venera 9 and 10 were stunning successes and represented a triumphant public relations event for the Soviet Union. They sought a sequel.  </p><p>Venera 11 and 12 would go on to do some interesting science, but because a mysterious electric anomaly disabled their cameras, their trips have largely been forgotten. It was a bit of a disappointing follow up to the 9 and 10. But Soviet scientists geared up for the grand finale. </p><h2>Venera 13 and 14</h2><p>Kind of like the iPhone 11 as compared to the iPhone X, the Venera 13 and 14 retained the core principles from the 9 and 10 but refined the edges and corners. </p><p>Engineers improved the cameras, the scientific instruments, and added new heat-resistant technologies. They even rated it to last at least 30 minutes down there. Guaranteed or your money back. And cool, color images can now be taken! </p><p>The amazing thing was that many of these sensors and instruments could now mounted outside the spherical pressure chamber. Made of platinum and covered in acid-resistant enamel, their placement is a testament to their engineers' understanding of and experience with the crushing Venusian environment. </p><p>Venera 13 arrived first, landing as planned. The lens cap popped off as expected and took two photos. A first contingency photo of black and white and then another in color. </p><p>The photos showed a surface of pebbled, loose soil amidst outcroppings of bed rock, looking similar to the bottom of the ocean. </p><p>In the distance, rolling plateaus and an orange sky. The Venusian atmosphere absorbs blue light, so most things will look orange or yellowish. </p><p>Venera 14's images showed a more weathered plain with fine-grained rock and far less loose soil. Something like a baked cake. The rock appears younger, but nobody knows for sure because Venera 14's drill famously drilled exactly on where the lens cap had landed. </p><p>The two probes held microphones and sent back what they heard. Amazingly enough it never really occurred to the Soviets at the time to release the audio they picked up. </p><p>You can probably find it on Reddit somewhere, but after you hear the lens cap blowing off and the drill drilling, Venus sounds like a gently blowing wind with faint hints of distant rumblings. Presumed to be Venus-quakes.  </p><p>An amazing Soviet achievement. But they would be the last landers to touch the Venusian surface. Venera 15 and 16 swapped out the lander component with radar, thereafter mapping the Venusian topography from orbit. </p><h2>Conclusion </h2><p>The last Venera landers were built in the 1980s. Space programs since then have shifted to the Moon and Mars. I suppose there is a justified reason for this. No human is ever going to set foot on Venus. Well, alive anyway. </p><p>But it is possible to send another lander back to the Venusian surface. Engineers know what to expect and that it can be done. The Soviets did it with decades-old technology. </p><p>The problem is of course economics and cost-benefit. There is something weird about investing so much time and resources into a thing that survives less than a day. And by weird I mean insane. Most of the Venus exploration proposals have been things like balloons and other high altitude floating explorations. </p><p>To make the economics work for a lander, you have to send something that can get there, move around and last for weeks on end. The cooling technologies capable of doing that are, to put it lightly, a few years away. </p><p>Much of the secret work done during the Soviet era for the Venera series is now lost. But there are some interesting developments in extreme environment technologies that might make a return trip possible. Perhaps we can go over that in a future video if this one does well. Let's say 700 likes? </p><p>Regardless the Venera series was an amazing engineering achievement and in my opinion represented the country&#8217;s pinnacle of space exploration. I loved researching every bit of this.</p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://asianometry.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share The Asianometry Newsletter&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://asianometry.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share The Asianometry Newsletter</span></a></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Two Carl Zeisses]]></title><description><![CDATA[Author&#8217;s note: If you want to watch the full video, it&#8217;s below I am a little disappointed by how this video did.

One based in the Federal Republic of Germany, or West Germany. The other in the German Democratic Republic, or East Germany. </p><p>Wait. Is "Zeisses" a word? I am not sure if it is. Whatever. </p><p>The Carl Zeiss of today is the Western German variant. Their work in lithography and EUV sits on the cutting edge of what is possible in nanoscale technology. </p><p>But the Carl Zeiss of East Germany was fascinating too. It grew to be a massive industrial conglomerate, doing cutting edge research into optics, military tech, and semiconductors. </p><p>In this video, I want to step away from Asia once more and look at a fascinating history. One of Germany's most iconic companies, split in two between East and West. Capitalism and Socialism. Let's go! </p><h2>Carl Zeiss Before World War II</h2><p>We do not need the whole story on Carl Zeiss, the man or the company. Here is an abbreviated history on things up until World War II. </p><p>Carl Zeiss was born in 1816 to a family of artisans. He started a workshop and that workshop repaired university equipment, made microscopes, and sold scientific instruments like eyeglass lens and thermometers. </p><p>In 1866, Zeiss recruited Ernst Abbe, a brilliant 26-year old physicist from the University of Jena. Abbe's insights on the movement of light rays through microscope lens helped the company to move beyond crude trial-and-error manufacturing and gave it a leg up on its competitors. </p><p>After Zeiss's death in 1888, Abbe purchased sole ownership of the company from Carl's son. He then transferred his ownership to what is now called the Carl Zeiss foundation. </p><p>The foundation has no owners or shareholders. Its purpose was to guarantee the company's existence after Abbe's death and that its employees can partake in its economic success. </p><p>The foundation's guidelines outlined social reforms like health insurance, pensions, profit sharing, equality in hiring decisions, overtime pay, and 9-hour work days. Excess profits would be invested in the working population of Jena.</p><p>Critically, Dr. Abbe wrote in a provision saying that the company's seat of operations should not be removed from the city of Jena. This provision cannot be modified. But Abbe didn&#8217;t know about World War II. </p><h2>World War II</h2><p>At the end of World War II in April 1945, the US Army first arrived at and occupied the city of Jena. But the city fell within the Soviet zone of influence. So the United States had to withdraw from the area in July of that year. </p><p>By then Zeiss was already an industrial crown jewel. As part of a policy to bring leading German scientists under American control, the Americans quickly spirited away 120-130 (the exact number is unclear) of the company's top technicians and execs. They would be resettled in the West German city of Oberkochen. </p><p>The Americans promised the Zeiss workers that their papers and equipment would soon follow, but those got shipped to the States. Whoops. </p><p>Once they arrived in Oberkochen, the small group of managers and scientists began starting up production. They formed a new company called Zeiss Opton, with the majority of the stock issued to the Zeiss Foundation. </p><p>Regarding Abbe's Jena provision, the state government of Baden-Wurttemberg simply issued a decree to add a second domicile. This essentially allows the Zeiss Opton managers to assume control of all of the Foundation's assets outside of the Soviet zone. Unprecedented, but then again these were unprecedented times. </p><p>A few Zeiss employees voted not to abandon the Jena plant. After all, Jena was their home. They may have also believed that they could work with the Soviets. Or that the Soviets would never dare try to dismantle the world-famous Zeiss factories. It was not an uncommon attitude at the time, with the Soviet occupation an unknown quantity. </p><h2>The Soviets Arrive </h2><p>Well, the Soviets did it. Twice. On July 9, 1946, the Soviet Council of Ministers ordered the complete dismantling of the Zeiss factories. The equipment, along with 300 former Zeiss employees, would be sent to the city of Krasnogorsk, a center for Soviet military optics research. </p><p>The Soviet Military Administration in Germany appealed to Stalin, and the Man of Steel ordered the Council to leave a small part behind. The council agreed to leave 6% of the factories' capacity. </p><p>What the Soviets did to Zeiss was not all that unusual. For an amazing chronicle of this time period, I recommend Anne Applebaum's "Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe 1944-1956". Really, go read it. </p><p>Anyway. Before the Opton management board left, they appointed some care-takers in Jena to act in the company's interests. For a brief amount of time, the two companies - Opton and Jena - and their boards agreed that the Jena caretaker board would be the sole representative of Carl Zeiss, the former corporate entity and foundation. </p><p>Both parties agreed to do this so not to agitate the Soviets into expropriating what was left of the company's assets. There also might have been some blackmailing going on behind the scenes by the Soviets - attempting to use the Opton board members' prior involvement in Nazi war crimes to pressure them into accepting full power of attorney from Jena. </p><p>This facade ultimately failed. Zeiss rebuilt some of its Jena factories but in 1948, the new German state expropriated all of the Foundation's assets without compensation. A new state-owned enterprise called VEB Carl Zeiss Jena took over the assets. </p><p>VEB meaning Volkseigener Betrieb, or state owned enterprise. </p><h2>Will The Real Carl Zeiss Stand Up</h2><p>So! Here is a philosophical question for you. Carl Zeiss used to be one corporation owned by one foundation. Now you have two companies and two foundations in two parts of the world. Both of them claiming to be the One True Carl Zeiss. </p><p>You now got some sort of weird Ship of Theseus situation going on. Both of the companies essentially had to start from zero. Both had critical members of the old company working for them. Both claim to be the real Carl Zeiss with the backings of their respective governments. Which one do you believe?</p><p>What happened next can be seen as a microcosm of the Cold War. Starting in the 1950s, the East German regime took control of the old Carl Zeiss Foundation entity and began claiming identity and control of the Zeiss trademarks. </p><p>Remember, this East German foundation is by now essentially an empty shell - the corporate assets and employees are now actually part of VEB Carl Zeiss Jena, the state-owned enterprise. The East German Zeiss Foundation exists for the sole purpose of staking claim to the old Zeiss trademarks. </p><p>The two firms battled it out in court over the next few decades. As you might guess, the Western courts backed Zeiss Opton, the West Germany version, while the Soviet Bloc courts backed Zeiss Jena, the East Germany version. </p><p>The legal intricacies are pretty fascinating to me, and I recommend "Zeiss vs Zeiss" by Isaac Shapiro if you want to learn all those nitty gritty details. </p><p>But I am going to skip all that and tell you the ending. After nearly two decades of litigation, the two companies split the world in half and agreed not to use the Zeiss trademark in each other's half of the world. </p><p>They can still operate there, just not use the Zeiss name. Zeiss of West Germany would use the name Opton in Eastern Bloc countries. Zeiss of East Germany went with something called "ausJENA" in Western bloc countries. </p><h2>VEB Carl Zeiss Jena </h2><p>There is little information out there about VEB Carl Zeiss Jena. While Zeiss Opton carried on in the optics field, VEB Zeiss Jena would eventually grow into a massive technology conglomerate. </p><p>For a while after its reorganization, Zeiss Jena attempted to build proficiency in the sciences and engineering. There were some successes. They exhibited a special new electron microscope in 1952, and in 1955 built East Germany's first working computer, the Oprema. </p><p>The "Optikrechenmaschine" or "Oprema" was for lens systems calculations. It had been in the planning since 1946. </p><p>It was a relay computer, which means it used electrically operated switches to do calculations. With its 8,313 relays, it had a clock speed of about 100 hertz and could perform square root operations in 1.2 seconds. </p><p>That being said, the company only made two and the machine's relay technology had already been superseded by vacuum tube computer technology at the time of its release. </p><p>In the 1960s, the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany or SED, shifted the company's direction towards pure engineering. But due to import restrictions and supplier difficulties, the company fell behind its Western competitors. Substantial quality control issues emerged as early as 1960. By 1968, the company was essentially bankrupt. </p><p>In the 1970s and 80s, SED gradually reorganized the East German economy into massive conglomerates, called <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombinat">Kombinate</a>. Zeiss Jena found itself with integrated control over many other smaller VEBs. The new Zeiss conglomerate was instructed to conduct R&amp;D on a variety of new technologies including robotics, computing and most importantly, microelectronics. </p><h2>Walter Biermann </h2><p>Around this time, SED and the rest of the socialist bloc were growing very concerned about the West's rapid advancement in semiconductor technology. </p><p>The Zeiss Kombinat's most primary task would be to leverage the company's expertise in optics to built advanced photolithography equipment for the country's indigenous semiconductor industry.</p><p>The task was given to Zeiss Jena's director Wolfgang Biermann. An uncompromising, authoritarian leader with an indomitable will to succeed, he ran Zeiss like a virtual state within a state. And since he had a seat on the SED's Central Committee, he had an unusual amount of political leeway. </p><p>Under his leadership, Zeiss Jena production doubled despite the labor force staying the same size. 60% of its products were made for export, and it was the only Kombinat with a sales office in the US. </p><p>The company was even the global leader in the planetary optics space. </p><p>However, he and the company failed to reverse East Germany's declining competitiveness. Despite successfully producing lithography equipment for its sibling conglomerates, the country's semiconductor efforts as a whole during this period fell short of those in the West and Japan.</p><h2>Decline and Collapse </h2><p>Going into the late 1980s, the Zeiss Jena Kombinat employed nearly 70,000 people in 25 subsidiaries. It was the second largest Kombinat after VEB Robotron, East Germany's largest electronics manufacturer. </p><p>As the Soviet Union's own native capacity declined, the GDR ordered the conglomerate to expand its military industrial production from 15.7% in 1983 to 28% in 1990. They made some great products at this time like an optoelectronic homing head for an air-to-air missile and a rangefinder for a T-72 tank. </p><p>However, Soviet demand for military technology vanished in 1986 after Gorbachev's disarmament policies came into effect. Zeiss Jena realized that it needed to switch directions again and prepare for a future opening up of the economy. </p><p>At the time of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Zeiss Jena was working on the production of its 1 megabit memory chip: the U61000. </p><h2>Reunification </h2><p>German reunification happened in October 1990 and it was a mess. Officially, East Germany dissolved itself and added its former properties to West Germany. And that is a befitting metaphor to what happened to the two Carl Zeisses. </p><p>It was a hard time for everyone back then. East German industrial output fell by 51% year over year. Three million east Germans lost their jobs. </p><p>The Zeiss Kombinat split apart shortly before reunification. 12 of its 25 constituent companies were spun off unto their own. Many of those companies immediately shed thousands of jobs. The remaining 13 companies were renamed Jenoptik Carl Zeiss Jena. </p><p>In 1991, Zeiss Opton acquired Jenoptik Carl Zeiss Jena's microscopy and optics divisions. This essentially reunited the pre-war Carl Zeiss firm. However, the new company turned multi-million D-mark losses as it tried to digest this massive influx of workers amidst new competition from Asia. Despite state support, the company still shed hundreds of jobs over the next few years. </p><p>The leftover bits of Jenoptik Carl Zeiss Jena, renamed to Jenoptik as it was no longer associated with the old Carl Zeiss company, was a diversified technology firm employing nearly 7,000 people. It operated in semiconductors, laser optics, and automation. </p><p>At first it was in danger of collapsing. But then the government stepped in, buying 80% of the assets and saving thousands of high paying jobs. </p><p>Guided by Dr. Lothar Spaeth, former Minister-President of Baden-W&#252;rttemberg, Jenoptik prudently grew through acquisition over the next decade. </p><p>In 1998, they conducted a $400 million USD IPO. </p><p>Jenoptik is doing well today, valued at over a billion dollars. </p><h2>Conclusion </h2><p>Zeiss Jena took a really interesting path through history after its split from Opton. The company encountered substantial challenges throughout its 40+ year history. </p><p>The socialist party structure kept employees from reaping the economic benefits of their own discoveries. </p><p>Import restrictions from the West prevented Zeiss Jena from getting their hands on Western technologies, especially in microelectronics, and forced them to do all it themselves. This was a crucial difference from the countries of East Asia, which were allowed to acquire and absorb technologies from the West. </p><p>Enforced by the Stasi, an atmosphere of excessive security impeded the company from doing its best work. Workers could not speak about what they were doing, and they were promoted based on their ideologies, rather than their merits. </p><p>Yet despite this, the company managed to do amazing research - filing as many patents as its West German brother. It became a global leader in certain industries. And it was one of the few East German companies to emerge from reunification largely intact. </p><p>The whole era of Zeiss Jena's attempted modernization was pretty fascinating to read about. Perhaps I will do a future detailed dive into East Germany's semiconductor space and why that failed. Let me know if that is something interesting to you.</p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://asianometry.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share The Asianometry Newsletter&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://asianometry.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share The Asianometry Newsletter</span></a></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[On Funding, World-Class Taiwan startups, and Taiwanese Entrepreneurs ]]></title><description><![CDATA[On Funding, World-Class Taiwanese startups, and Taiwanese Entrepreneurialism]]></description><link>https://asianometry.substack.com/p/thoughts-from-sparklabs-taipei-demo</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://asianometry.substack.com/p/thoughts-from-sparklabs-taipei-demo</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jon Y]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 17:00:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F345e2dc2-7e36-442e-85af-39eccc7cd13e_2947x2896.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During my last trip to Meet Greater South, which I covered in the newsletter linked below, I was invited to attend the <a href="https://www.sparklabstaipei.com/demoday">SparkLabs Taipei</a> Demo Day. </p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:45500878,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://asianometry.substack.com/p/a-peek-into-southern-taiwans-tech&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:38270,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;The Asianometry Newsletter&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/29b508ee-ed21-4f32-b3bb-61d594678cb7_1080x1080.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;A Peek into Southern Taiwan&#8217;s Tech Scene &quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;If you want to see the video first, it is below:&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2021-12-16T07:00:36.063Z&quot;,&quot;like_count&quot;:5,&quot;comment_count&quot;:0,&quot;bylines&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:113937,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Jon Y&quot;,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a4aed493-053e-4062-acd9-7a14e9eb92c5_1600x1200.jpeg&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;A writer in Taipei&quot;,&quot;profile_set_up_at&quot;:null,&quot;publicationUsers&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:252944,&quot;user_id&quot;:113937,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;admin&quot;,&quot;public&quot;:true,&quot;is_primary&quot;:false,&quot;publication&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:38270,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;The Asianometry Newsletter&quot;,&quot;subdomain&quot;:&quot;asianometry&quot;,&quot;custom_domain&quot;:null,&quot;custom_domain_optional&quot;:false,&quot;hero_text&quot;:&quot;Newsletter for the Asianometry channel.

At least pretend that I am still part of a tech community, right? So I signed up and attended last Thursday at the CPC Building in Xinyi. </p><p>If you want a pretty thorough breakdown, I recommend <a href="https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47581">Meet Global&#8217;s writeup</a>. It gives a concise overview of what happened. To this, I want to add a few things. </p><h3>These are impressive startups </h3><p>Edgar&#8217;s talks occasionally fall on the corny side. For instance, he likes to do these catchphrases like &#8220;Dream Big! Go Global!&#8221; and he shouted it at the end of his keynote at the show. He really sort of reminds me of your corny uncle at the family gatherings. </p><p>I reckon it is a Taiwan rah-rah, the-Boss-trying-to-be-just-one-of-the-guys sort of thing. I see this corniness in the office places of small and big companies alike. Considering the alternative tends to be the militaristic, at-all-costs style pioneered by companies like Foxconn, I am fine with it. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdacf410-4533-4dd0-80c8-0ee392ffa836_2775x1955.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdacf410-4533-4dd0-80c8-0ee392ffa836_2775x1955.jpeg" width="472" height="332.54545454545456" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bdacf410-4533-4dd0-80c8-0ee392ffa836_2775x1955.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:775,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:472,&quot;bytes&quot;:1119694,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdacf410-4533-4dd0-80c8-0ee392ffa836_2775x1955.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdacf410-4533-4dd0-80c8-0ee392ffa836_2775x1955.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdacf410-4533-4dd0-80c8-0ee392ffa836_2775x1955.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdacf410-4533-4dd0-80c8-0ee392ffa836_2775x1955.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Beneath the corniness, however, I grasp what he is getting at: Export discipline. Companies that are able to compete on a global marketplace are valuable. Taiwan&#8217;s market is somewhat small. Companies that focus on the Taiwan market first are not suited to scale up to Western markets. Language and culture makes them more suited to go to China, but that market is becoming increasingly unfriendly. </p><p>Expanding into overseas Western markets helps sharpen these companies&#8217; business models and tap growth. Being able to acquire funding from overseas VC funds shows that they are doing good on a global scale and aren&#8217;t just collecting investments because they are big fish in a small pond. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d2f6988-83a2-4c5e-82ac-ad097b832427_2602x1766.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d2f6988-83a2-4c5e-82ac-ad097b832427_2602x1766.jpeg" width="466" height="316.4563636363636" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4d2f6988-83a2-4c5e-82ac-ad097b832427_2602x1766.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:747,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:466,&quot;bytes&quot;:1104463,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d2f6988-83a2-4c5e-82ac-ad097b832427_2602x1766.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d2f6988-83a2-4c5e-82ac-ad097b832427_2602x1766.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d2f6988-83a2-4c5e-82ac-ad097b832427_2602x1766.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d2f6988-83a2-4c5e-82ac-ad097b832427_2602x1766.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">More people need to know about Delta Electronics</figcaption></figure></div><p>Obviously, the Demo Day chose the healthiest bunch of the litter to trot out for scrutiny.

Contrast this with the situation in the United States, where even a premier accelerator like Y-Combinator <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/deal/">takes something like 7% in return for $125K</a>. 40-50% is just too much. A few equity rounds and the founders no longer own their own company. If I was a founder, why deal with that noise?</p><p>I am not quite sure what to think of this situation. Taiwan is awash in savings and wealth. Taipei <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-01/ultra-rich-hide-their-hermes-in-asia-s-city-of-stealth-wealth">is one of the richest cities in the world</a> - though not a lot of people might know it. With all that capital sloshing around, why not slice off a bit of that into risky startups? But I get the sense that most of this wealth is locked up in ultra-conservative hands - like the life insurers or 95-year-old grandpas who would rather invest their money in another luxury apartment in Taipei. Or <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/2330.TW/">TSMC</a>. </p><p>I have been hearing this ever since 2016 when I first arrived here. The startup CEOs back then have been consistently saying the same thing: We can&#8217;t get funding for our companies unless we go abroad. I do think the attitude is slowly &#8230; slowly changing. SparkLabs Taipei seems to be on the more progressive side of venture capitalists, aiming to be the YC of Taiwan and Asia. </p><p><em>Side note: <a href="https://appworks.tw/team/jamie-lin/">Jamie Lin</a> of AppWorks is a particularly interesting case too. I have been thinking about his story for a while now, but had no occasion to talk about it. He founded AppWorks, which I think also wanted to be the YC of Taiwan. But then he became CEO of Taiwan Mobile, Taiwan&#8217;s second largest mobile network and subsidiary of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fubon_Financial_Holding_Co.">Fubon Group</a> - a $100 billion Taiwanese chaebol that nobody outside of Taiwan knows about.</em> </p><p><em>Since then, Taiwan Mobile&#8217;s been doing a lot of interesting things in e-Commerce (their <a href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2020/07/14/2003739855">subsidiary Momo</a> is either number 1 or 2 in Taiwan alongside Shopee) and also media (they produced a Netflix <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Victims%27_Game">original TV show</a>). I wonder if they&#8217;re aiming to be the <a href="https://compoundingcuriosity.substack.com/p/ep23">Sea Group</a> of Taiwan. </em></p><h3>Taiwan is Still Working at AI. But Should It?</h3><p>I have done videos before about artificial intelligence. In America, I don&#8217;t think anyone is talking about machine learning and AI all that much anymore. Feels like Web3 is the big tech catchphrase now. </p><p>But in Taiwan, AI is still a thing. One of the noticeable themes in a few of the pitches is that Taiwan&#8217;s domestic companies have yet to adopt it into their workflows.

In some ways, Taiwan is indeed quite backward. Companies run on lot of paperwork and old fashioned analog business practices like the use of the <a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=32b34645-7730-4930-9ab5-10803259e319">Company Seal</a> or chop. It would be great if they can optimize using AI. </p><p>But at the same time, in order for a lot of AI projects to work out the right way you need to collect a lot of data. Which Taiwan companies aren&#8217;t exactly great at doing. Or do some really crazy custom stuff with the actual technology. This option is expensive. </p><p>I cannot help but recall SenseTime, China&#8217;s biggest AI system integrator. The <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Markets/SenseTime-s-post-IPO-rally-surprises-market#:~:text=%2C%22%20Lau%20added.-,SenseTime%20recorded%20a%20loss%20of%203.71%20billion%20yuan%20(%24583,the%20first%20half%20of%202021.">company lost a stunning</a> $583 million on $260 million revenue in the first half of 2021. If SenseTime with all their fancy PhDs and 996 can&#8217;t turn a profit, what is the future for these small AI startups?</p><h3>The Two Types of Entrepreneurs </h3><p>I suppose I should close this newsletter with some deep and insightful thought on the Taiwanese small business and investing landscape. I don&#8217;t have one. But here is something that has been turning around in my head for a while and I want to get it out. </p><p>I cannot speak much for the rest of the world, but what I have noticed in Taiwan is that Taiwanese are very entrepreneurial. But the companies they start are not very friendly with the Western model of venture capitalism. </p><p>When Taiwanese think of VC and tech startups, they are thinking of a pair of young guys or ladies posing in a slick office with their arms folded. The Silicon Valley type of business. And I am quite familiar with it too. </p><p>But most new, non-F&amp;B (Food &amp; Beverage) businesses in Taiwan are small 1-5 person shops founded by an experienced person - usually over 40. For instance, <a href="https://panelsemi.com/f/%E7%94%A8%E9%8F%A1%E9%A0%AD%E7%9C%8B%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E3%80%8Bmeet-taipei%E5%89%B5%E6%96%B0%E5%89%B5%E6%A5%AD%E5%98%89%E5%B9%B4%E8%8F%AF-%E5%85%8B%E6%9C%8D%E7%96%AB%E6%83%85%E5%A4%A7%E7%A7%80%E7%A7%91%E6%8A%80%E5%AF%A6%E5%8A%9B">PanelSemi</a>, the display company I met back at Meet Taipei, was founded by someone who worked at AU Optronics down in Tainan for many years. They get an idea after working many years in the industry, know exactly the need for it, and build a solution to meet the need. </p><p>You don&#8217;t even need a product. For instance, trading companies in Taiwan. Trading companies exist to help vet, connect, and grease the wheels of business in Taiwan. They are small companies - 7 employees at the most - founded by one or two people who know the industry. If someone wants to make and sell socks to the West, they meet the trading company first rather than the actual factory. The trading company helps set up the deal, arrange the little details, and set up logistics in exchange for a small commission. </p><p>I reckon that most of these small businesses are not that interested in growth or aren&#8217;t interested in VC money. They exist because someone wants to work on their own terms, can&#8217;t find another job in the industry, etc. They have a good chance of succeeding in the industry because of their experience and connections. But this makes them largely ineligible for venture capital funding - with the VC industry&#8217;s focus on hitting rare but big home runs. </p><p>Anyway, I genuinely do feel there will be a billion dollar Taiwan tech startup soon. If it isn&#8217;t AmazingTalker, then another. For instance, one of SparkLabs&#8217; biggest portfolio companies never seems to participate in any of their events <em>(</em>their logo is in the picture above<em>)</em>. But I think too much focus on Silicon Valley startups as the only way to do entrepreneurism in Taiwan misses a lot of the picture. </p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://asianometry.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share The Asianometry Newsletter&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://asianometry.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share The Asianometry Newsletter</span></a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[SMIC Today]]></title><description><![CDATA[I wanted to write to do a follow up on my previous newsletter.

Gross margin also reached a record 33.1%.</p></blockquote><p>To be actually profitable is a good thing. For instance, GlobalFoundries is the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-10-05/how-a-global-foundry-is-losing-money-in-a-chip-boom?sref=LlJOmbkZ">third largest</a> foundry and yet they are not actually profitable. The gross margin number is quite good and indicates either that they are using their pricing power, or that they have hit scale. </p><p>The bigger concern is that the company seems to be in conflict about their future direction. Four of their board directors left, including two of its prized TSMC hires - Chiang Shang-yi and Liang Mong-song.</p><p>Chiang and Liang are legendary (and infamous) actors in the TSMC story. Liang helped pioneer the copper interconnect technology in 2003 that helped TSMC leapfrog IBM. Chiang made a super-critical decision at the 28nm node that helped TSMC leapfrog Samsung. </p><p><em>(Liang is also legendary for <a href="https://riversonicsolutions.com/pdfs/LiangMong.pdf">leaving TSMC to go to Samsung</a>, sparking a massive lawsuit in Taiwan. Liang helped Samsung catch up to TSMC)</em></p><p>Should SMIC should go for the leading edge? Right now their leading edge is 14nm FinFet  - already 5 years behind the leading edge - with another in R&amp;D that the media calls 7nm. I do recall that Nikkei said that Liang has been a really big force within the company pushing them towards more and more advanced nodes. </p><p>Personally, I do actually agree with Liang. You want to aggressively seize the technical leading edge, and on the basis of your own natural internal R&amp;D work. The problem is that they need EUV to go further. </p><div id="youtube2-jJIO7aRXUCg" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;jJIO7aRXUCg&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jJIO7aRXUCg?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p><a href="https://semiengineering.com/china-accelerates-foundry-power-semi-efforts/">What they are already doing at 7nm (more like a 8nm)</a> I bet makes it slow, low-yielding and difficult to commercialize. </p><p>A lot of commenters have said that 7nm, 14nm, and 22nm are &#8220;enough&#8221;. Which is sort of ridiculous because nodes are not all the same and they do not stay the same. The industry is aggressively moving forward. And TSMC is a very aggressive force in the industry. SMIC&#8217;s 8nm is still sitting in the lab. </p><p>TSMC will aggressively compete away its competitors&#8217; best process nodes until a fabless company won&#8217;t think of using any other foundry. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ff533a3-9f53-45a1-98cc-4e9be60ba989_1280x720.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ff533a3-9f53-45a1-98cc-4e9be60ba989_1280x720.jpeg" width="580" height="326.3818181818182" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6ff533a3-9f53-45a1-98cc-4e9be60ba989_1280x720.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:619,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:580,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ff533a3-9f53-45a1-98cc-4e9be60ba989_1280x720.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ff533a3-9f53-45a1-98cc-4e9be60ba989_1280x720.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ff533a3-9f53-45a1-98cc-4e9be60ba989_1280x720.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ff533a3-9f53-45a1-98cc-4e9be60ba989_1280x720.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Shameless Plug: I talk more on this in this Early Access video</figcaption></figure></div><p>I recently finished a massive series of EUV and Fab related videos (which are sitting in Patreon Early Access right now) and one of the things that I learned is just how much nuance vanishes underneath the simple &#8220;nanometer&#8221; marketing term.

That&#8217;s it.

Meh. </em></p></li></ul><p><em>We need to put the event and the company in context. This was a different time, and SMIC back then was not a Chinese national treasure. </em></p><p><em>SMIC at the time was essentially a foreign-run company that set up in China to take advantage of cheaper labor and favorable government subsidies. Their top management came from abroad - note the Italian Marco Mora below - and their technology was imported. A significant portion of their products were exported abroad, mostly to the US, which gave TSMC grounds to sue them there. </em></p><p><em>The success of the TSMC lawsuit combined with the Taiwanese company&#8217;s continued aggressive push would set SMIC back for a decade. Perhaps permanently. </em></p><div><hr></div><p>It is 2003 and TSMC is grappling with the hot new thing in town: Semiconductor Manufacturing International, the rising startup based out of Shanghai. </p><p>Founded in 2000 by hard charging serial entrepreneur Richard Chang, SMIC was growing fast. Suspiciously fast. They and competitor Grace Semiconductor were stealing away some of TSMC's best people. What TSMC suspected was that SMIC was stealing more than *just* that. </p><p>Thus in 2003, the Taiwanese company launched a landmark legal battle against its mainland rival. The lawsuit would not be resolved for nearly six years, but it would end with a big TSMC victory. In this video, let us look at the time when TSMC sued SMIC ... and won. </p><h2>The Semiconductor Process </h2><p>I want to go over briefly the complexity of developing a new semiconductor making process. This is not a video about how to make semiconductors. So I am going to make a few generalizations in discussing the critical points. </p><p>In previous videos, I talked a lot about several specific methods and techniques like EUV and photolithography. It might leave you with the impression that that&#8217;s all there is to it. But fabricating a chip is more than just lithography. There are thousands of steps with complicated names like etching, ion implantation, and chemical mechanical polishing. </p><p>At a new process node, a company needs to figure out new technologies so that you can lay down the circuits while avoiding issues like cracks, current leakage, and particle contamination. </p><p>You start out with R&amp;D that determines the specifications of the equipment. Then you select and integrate together that equipment. Then you got to determine the "recipes" and "design rules" behind the individual steps of the overall process flow. Recipes can mean like equipment settings - temperature, pressure, materials, and duration of the process. It really is like cooking. </p><p>You make changes and then test the product output for its quality - choosing the ones that make the best trade-offs. The knowledge gained from that trial-and-error process are often not patented but instead kept privately within the company as a trade secret. This is the valuable knowledge that SMIC targeted. </p><h2>Suspicions </h2><p>Richard Chang and his startup team had quite a lot of experience. No denying that. This was Chang's second rodeo. He knew what he was doing. But the speed with which SMIC was getting things up and running rang alarm bells. </p><p>Generally for a China-based foundry, you can expect to take about 21-30 months to go through this entire process and have a new multi-step node ready for customers. That&#8217;s how long Grace semiconductor took in launching their first foundry. SMIC was not taking that long. </p><p>SMIC was founded in April 2000. Four months later in August 2000, they broke ground on their first fab: SMIC Fab 1 in Shanghai. This 12,511 square meter building with all its respective cleanrooms was completed in June 2001. </p><p>It took SMIC just two months to install all of the necessary equipment. Then four months later, a 0.18 micrometer process had passed quality checks and was ready for customers with zero non-conformances. Volume production began January 2002 with around 500 200-millimeter sized wafers a month and scaled up by 2,000 each month with world-leading yields. </p><p>Six months from equipment installation to high volume production is kind of insane. Grace Semiconductor, SMIC's China nemesis, had an aggressive ramp-up schedule of their own for 0.18 micrometers. But they publicly announced that it would take them 18-21 months. </p><p>TSMC's director of brand management Charles Byers would say in a statement: </p><blockquote><p>You begin asking questions when a company ramps a process in six months that took another company two years. That raises eyebrows. </p></blockquote><p>Fab 1 single-handedly narrowed the technology gap between China and the rest of world from 4-5 generations to 1-2 generations. In just a year. And remember, they&#8217;ve never done this before. </p><p>SMIC, for their part, replied that they managed to do this so fast because of the global shift to outsourcing and competitive prices. And also, I suppose, the power of Friendship. </p><p>TSMC suspected that the real reason behind it was SMIC running an operation to obtain critical, proprietary information. Turns out, those suspicions were correct. But more on that later. </p><h2>The First Lawsuit</h2><p>In early 2002, TSMC filed a lawsuit in Taiwan trying to prevent SMIC from hiring away their senior managers. They won an injunction in a Taiwanese court, but they knew that this injunction had no power in the mainland. </p><p>So the company decided to file their December 2003 lawsuit in the United States. You might wonder then, how can a lawsuit in the United States affect a Chinese company? </p><p>The answer is that while SMIC's main operations are in Shanghai in the People's Republic, the actual corporate entity is a Cayman Islands corporation. This is a common structure for the purpose of allowing the company to be IPO'ed in the United States. Which it did in 2004. </p><p>Furthermore, a significant portion of the semiconductors that SMIC fabs make in China are being imported to the United States. The lawsuit sought as a remedy a permanent ban on all semiconductor imports from SMIC to the US. This would be immensely damaging. </p><p>After the legal discovery process was completed, TSMC argued for the existence of a coordinated, sustained effort to obtain proprietary process flow, fab layout and operations information. </p><h2>The Evidence </h2><p>The evidence begins with TSMC doing a forensic analysis of a Broadcom 0.18 micrometer process chip made by SMIC. They discovered that 90% of the logic process had been copied from TSMC. This is confirmed by sworn testimony by SMIC employees. </p><p>Willy Luo, a former TSMC senior process engineer who defected to SMIC, testified:  </p><blockquote><p>I was told that SMIC had a code name for TSMC&#8217;s process recipes called BKM1, which stood for &#8216;Best Known Method One' </p></blockquote><p>Another SMIC employee testifies in a sworn statement: </p><blockquote><p>This was confirmed by my co-workers at SMIC, many of whom had come from TSMC. To my knowledge, SMIC&#8217;s use of TSMC&#8217;s process information was both known by, and encouraged by, senior SMIC managers</p></blockquote><p>One employee explicitly pointed out as having stolen TSMC information was C.Y. Shih. He was a Technical Manager of Technology Transfer Division, Diffusion and Thin Film Section before he resigned in Sept 2001. His job was to manage the records surrounding TSMC's trade secrets. The gatekeeper to the chicken coop, so to say. </p><p>The weekend before he left the company, Shih was observed by coworker Y.L. Wang photocopying private documents from TSMC's Fab 4. He had piles and piles of paper on his desk. Subtle. </p><p>Wang testifies: </p><blockquote><p>"[He] repeatedly asked me and two of my colleagues ... to provide electronic and hard copies of all improvements made during the past quarter for thin-film processes" </p></blockquote><p>Shih jumped ship a week later. Fab 4 in Hsinchu at the time made semiconductors using TSMC's 0.18 micrometer process - the same one that SMIC Shanghai Fab 1 would get going so fast and flawlessly. </p><p>More damningly, there are emails. Yes. Emails. Katy Liu, a high ranking TSMC employee, served as Program Manager of Quality and Reliability until Feb 2001. Unbeknownst to TSMC management, she had actually joined SMIC on July 2000 as a "Founding Project Manager". Between then and her termination, she basically acted as a corporate spy. </p><p>There, she solicited key employees to work for SMIC and sniffed out trade information to steal. She would offer those key employees something in the range of 50,000 to 80,000 shares of startup stock and stock options to leave TSMC for SMIC. </p><p>SMIC also directed her to sniff out specific critical trade secrets. In one email, SMIC COO Marco Mora told Katy: </p><blockquote><p>I need a help from you to pull-out information from WSMC/TSMC. I think you can [unreadable] some help from your people ... </p></blockquote><p>And then there is a long, specific list of exactly the TSMC technologies that SMIC wanted to copy. From the exact fabs. Marco closes the email with a kind apology: </p><blockquote><p>Sorry for the long list, but we need a lot of material to set up the new operation. </p></blockquote><p>How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man? Never put anything down in email that you don't want the world seeing! </p><p>SMIC's response to this in court was that there was no evidence that Katy ever got this information back to Mora. Katy Liu was convicted of corporate espionage on Taiwan but fled to the PRC and I guess permanently lives there now. </p><p>SMIC targets went beyond just those working at TSMC. Charles Chan worked at Broadcom as an account manager to TSMC. His position as a liaison between the two companies meant that he had access to private information like pricing, margin, and technical specifications. He left March 2002 to SMIC and used his knowledge to help SMIC land Broadcom as a client. </p><p>The fact that SMIC was copying TSMC could hardly be said to be a secret at the company. They literally marketed themselves as a replacement for TSMC. SMIC account managers told their prospective foundry customers that SMIC's fabrication processes were "TSMC compatible" and "just like TSMC's". One boasted that the two technologies were so similar that little design work would be needed on the customer's part so to make the switch. </p><h2>Settlement </h2><p>SMIC for their part attempted to fight back. Their senior management strenuously denied the allegations. They issued a statement warning against "artificial or unfair restrictions" on fair competition. </p><p>They emphasized that SMIC has been "consistently investing a significant portion of its annual budget in both R&amp;D activities as well as the acquisition of technologies from its partners in order to develop and build up its own technology and know-how". Their technology and processes are hard-won and their own! </p><p>For all their angry words, the lawsuit presented some pretty damning evidence. Then in 2004, TSMC expanded the lawsuit and added three more patents that SMIC had allegedly infringed on. In February 2005, it seemed clear that SMIC would not be able to get away from this and they settled. </p><p>The settlement agreement between SMIC and TSMC would have SMIC pay TSMC $175 million over six years. $30 million for each of the first five years and $25 million on the sixth. This is a significant chunk considering that the company made $120 million in profit for the 2004 year in total - they turned a $66 million loss in 2003. </p><p>In return, TSMC would allow a six-year cross license patent agreement to their respective portfolios. This is so long that SMIC return the stolen documents. </p><h2>The Second Wave</h2><p>This seemed like a satisfactory resolution, right? Wrong. A year later in August 2006, TSMC filed another lawsuit for another $130 million. </p><p>In it, they alleged that SMIC breached the settlement. They never returned the stolen documents and have continued copying manufacturing process information. As it turns out, SMIC had a lot more documents than at first revealed - 15,000 documents totaling 500,000 pages. </p><p>The complaint read: </p><blockquote><p>SMIC has carried out massive corporate espionage directed by certain [of] SMIC&#8217;s top operating officers ... SMIC lavishly copied the information it stole from TSMC, word for word, line for line, diagram for diagram, and even typographical error for typographical error</p></blockquote><p>SMIC this time decided to fight back. In November 2006, they filed a lawsuit in Beijing arguing that TSMC was essentially badmouthing their mainland rival. </p><p>The saga would last another three years. This was a time of difficulty for the semiconductor industry and as it turned out, TSMC had the resources to hold out. SMIC piled up increasing losses as the court battle and a bad economy distracted it. </p><p>In 2009, a California jury ruled that SMIC had indeed breached the agreement and stolen trade secrets. This would put SMIC on the hook for a billion dollars in damages. Furthermore, SMIC products would be permanently banned from the US.</p><p>SMIC finally caved a year later. The net losses and the jury decision made it clear that a new direction was needed. Chang resigned and the company settled. SMIC would pay TSMC $200 million and grant TSMC shares and options for a 10% stake in the business. </p><p>This new settlement would give TSMC a say in how its biggest mainland rival did things. It would also incentivize TSMC to keep the smaller company alive. Chang's resignation would also herald an era of calmer and friendlier relations. </p><h2>Conclusion </h2><p>Throughout the entire saga, TSMC wanted to protect its secrets. Trade secrets that cost billions of dollars to acquire. That was the foremost goal. </p><p>To the rest of the industry, the company showed that it could and would go to the mat in order to defend those secrets. And in the end, they likely took that stake in SMIC because they knew that if the company folded then its employees would scatter, taking those secrets with them. </p><p>After all of this, one can argue that SMIC&#8217;s shortcuts cost it dearly in the long run for two reasons. The lawsuit hamstrung the company's technological progress. I am reminded of how Microsoft&#8217;s monopoly battle in the 90s hamstrung it and prevented it from dominating the internet like it did in PCs. What customer would want to partner with a convicted plagiarist?</p><p>And finally, my big moral. Stealing someone else&#8217;s IP means that you didn&#8217;t make it yourself. And if you didn&#8217;t make it yourself then you have no idea how to make it better. You end up relying on someone else to do it for you. </p><p>SMIC has been a constant follower for a decade now. That's what happens when you don't own the technology to differentiate you from everyone else. It was only recently they&#8217;ve tried to do it themselves and despite having gotten quite far with it, that decade was indeed precious time lost.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://asianometry.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share The Asianometry Newsletter&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://asianometry.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share The Asianometry Newsletter</span></a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Asianometry in 2021 ]]></title><description><![CDATA[Reflections on a Year]]></description><link>https://asianometry.substack.com/p/asianometry-in-2021</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://asianometry.substack.com/p/asianometry-in-2021</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jon Y]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 08:00:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef186553-c23b-4719-802b-0c4f2e51a10a_750x1624.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello.

Through the year, over 145,000 subscribed to the channel. The channel received over 12 million views and people watched over 1.3 million hours. Most of the channel&#8217;s watchers were from the United States. After that would be India and Singapore. </p><p>It is nutty and I still cannot believe it. I am thankful to everyone. </p><h2>2021 Themes</h2><p>In 2021, Asianometry pivoted away from the Chinese/Taiwanese history/political content that it had been doing for the past 3 years. The Sept 2020 screenshot demonstrates the shift. </p><p>A lot of people know me for being the &#8220;semiconductor guy&#8221;. But not all of the channel&#8217;s top videos that year were semiconductor related. It was a healthy mix of topics. </p><p>In some ways, the channel&#8217;s top videos of the year reflect the predominant themes of the times. We live in interesting times. Changing economic conditions like rising inflation make life harder for society&#8217;s vulnerable classes. At the same time, people at the highest levels are accumulating wealth at accelerating rates. New technologies and science projects make the news all the time, but few turn out to be actual breakthroughs. </p><h3>The Chip Shortage</h3><p>In the tech world, everyone wanted to talk about the chip shortage. I had done a few videos about TSMC back in 2018, but they did just fine. Starting some time in September 2020 however, I started realizing that semiconductor videos got a decent number of views. </p><p>And unlike the political and historical content I used to do, this type of content did not get me screamed at by dozens of really angry pro and anti-Chinese netizens. If you look at the type of content that I did even late in 2020 and compare it to what I am doing now, there is a huge change. </p><p>The top performing chip-related video of 2021 was about India&#8217;s SCL foundry. I had been working on a video overview of India&#8217;s current semiconductor industry - like the one I had done for Malaysia - but stumbled across SCL. I felt that incident made for a better story than what I was working on. So I switched it out. </p><div id="youtube2-isBYV6QWDIo" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;isBYV6QWDIo&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/isBYV6QWDIo?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>This video on semiconductor demand and supply cycles did pretty well too. Very unexpectedly I would have to say. I did not feel like I was actually saying anything all that special. Boom and bust cycles happen. </p><div id="youtube2-Z7QkIECEkVc" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;Z7QkIECEkVc&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z7QkIECEkVc?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>Some other highlights include the video on ASML&#8217;s supply chain. I love the company&#8217;s openness to share what they have learned and how they work. </p><div id="youtube2-jJIO7aRXUCg" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;jJIO7aRXUCg&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jJIO7aRXUCg?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>And this one on semiconductor water usage struck a nerve with a lot of people. Water is one of those universal environmental things that everyone can sympathize with. </p><div id="youtube2-Dq04GpzRZ0g" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;Dq04GpzRZ0g&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Dq04GpzRZ0g?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>Semiconductor topics are difficult, but they are straightforward. I enjoy doing the research, and the advancements people are making in this space are incredible. Not just the latest lithography machines, but also design trends and technologies like MEMS, EDA, and nanosheets. </p><h3>Shipping </h3><p>Another big theme for the channel had been about container shipping. My first video of the type was on Singapore&#8217;s Neptune Orient Lines: </p><div id="youtube2-dBNKgGxpHwY" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;dBNKgGxpHwY&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dBNKgGxpHwY?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>While writing that story, I came across the story of the insolvency of Hanjin Shipping. This led me to the video below. </p><div id="youtube2-gOEU5rVBXRk" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;gOEU5rVBXRk&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gOEU5rVBXRk?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>This video would eventually do over 230,000 views, which surprised me. I honestly thought that video would flop. Perhaps this surge of interest in shipping has to do with the recent supply shortages and inflation pressures going on right now. But there is just something about big ships and containers that really interests me. Maybe it has to do with how well the containers slot together. </p><p>I am working on another shipping video right now. Procrastinating from working on it by doing this newsletter. </p><h3>Energy </h3><p>Several of my top performing videos had been about energy, namely electric vehicles. I did a few videos about China&#8217;s CATL, which seemed to have done well. One of my personal favorites had been on sodium ion battery technology - a video that took a very long time to do. </p><div id="youtube2-TVrlbMrEcCY" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;TVrlbMrEcCY&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TVrlbMrEcCY?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>I wish I can do a follow up on this one. But I haven&#8217;t been able to come up with an angle yet. If you can think of one, let me know. </p><p>Another video that I did had been on Chinese EV battery recycling policies. Somehow, this video picked up 230K views and discussion got particularly heated. I am not sure why. While working on this video, I had not been sure whether it would be worth releasing - a boring, straightforward policy review with a brief discussion of lead acid battery policies at the end. Many of the objections were pulled directly from Chinese sources. </p><div id="youtube2-u-38O6jSyiQ" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;u-38O6jSyiQ&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u-38O6jSyiQ?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><h3>Inequality and Reform </h3><p>The year&#8217;s second biggest video had been about the Zaibatsu of Japan. It has done over half a million views so far. </p><div id="youtube2-5_-Ac68FKG4" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;5_-Ac68FKG4&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5_-Ac68FKG4?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>Much of the video&#8217;s views came from the United States - more than the channel&#8217;s norm. I am not surprised, since the phrase is particularly American. I think it had been shared around a lot on left-leaning sites like Reddit with the notion that economic growth and reform were not mutually exclusive. </p><p>My video on Squid Game did nowhere as many views, but the response I got was surprisingly more forceful. More than a few people were quite upset and disappointed in me for &#8220;falling for a socialist delusion&#8221;. Just a TV show, dudes. </p><div id="youtube2-UyEIviK9gww" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;UyEIviK9gww&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UyEIviK9gww?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>Ideas for future videos in this realm might include elder poverty in South Korea, the Chinese two-child policy, and others. </p><h3>Australia</h3><p>One of my earliest breakout videos came all the way back in April, the Sun Cable which proposed to use High Voltage DC cable to bring power from Australia to Singapore. </p><div id="youtube2-KZBaDle5NbU" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;KZBaDle5NbU&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KZBaDle5NbU?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>I had a few growing pains with that video. Mostly learning about Australia&#8217;s geography and name pronunciations. </p><p>My next video in the area would be about Northern Australia and its economic development issues. I struggled with this video over the span of several weeks, before settling on the economic failure of the Ord River scheme. The video has done over 250K views, a surprise to me. </p><div id="youtube2-mjtj38rc2DI" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;mjtj38rc2DI&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mjtj38rc2DI?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>I have a couple other videos on Australia coming up in the weeks ahead including a big one on their domestic car industry. </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I do not expect the same topics that performed well in 2021 to also do well in 2022. Notably, I do think that the chip shortage will end at some point. If not in reality, then in the popular culture. The crowds will move onto whatever is next - NFTs, cryptos, and the Metaverse. </p><p>Asianometry will have to adapt to these changes too. It means tackling new, challenging topics that I have never covered before. Whatever those topics might be, I&#8217;ll tackle it with the same process and care as I have with everything else that I have worked on thus far. I hope that you, dear reader, will all be there along with me. </p><p>One final note. While 2021 was an amazing year for me professionally, it&#8217;s been a rough year personally. Things haven&#8217;t been so good at home. Lots of personal issues going on. I enjoy working on the videos - it&#8217;s one of the few times I can get away from everything at home - but it&#8217;s hard to keep up a twice-a-week cadence. It is lonely, and I am starting to burn out. </p><p>For 2022, I hope I can have more time for myself and those whom I love. I want to stay healthy so that I can keep doing this special thing. And I wish the same for all of you guys, as well. </p><p>Jon, Asianometry </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hollywood's Coming China Problem]]></title><description><![CDATA[Author&#8217;s Note: If you want to watch the video, you can below: I don&#8217;t think I am writing anything that the current movie industry already knows.

But China is actually turning into a competitor. In this video, I want to talk about the industry&#8217;s coming Chinese competition. </p><h2>China's Movie Market </h2><p>As opposed to the United States, China is adding thousands of theater screens to the market each year. </p><p>As of this writing in 2021, there are nearly 76,000 screens. They have added 5,794 in the past year - a pandemic year. </p><p>For many years, the western movie industry has been searching for way to replace declining DVD revenues. </p><p>At the same time, movies are getting more expensive. Either because of the rising costs of visual effects or because of higher star salaries. Budgets for blockbusters regularly run into the hundreds of millions - including marketing. </p><p>So every time a new film opens in the box office, they have to make back those millions. During the 2010s, the Chinese box office looked to be the way to help win back some of those declining DVD revenues. </p><h2>How the Market Works </h2><p>American movies entering the Chinese market have three major options to choose from. There is a flat-rate option, where a Chinese partner purchases the film distribution rights for a flat sum and gets to keep all the profits. </p><p>The American producer gets less upside here. And the FOMO can be quite great. For instance, in 2016 Leomus Pictures acquired the American film "Resident Evil: the Final Chapter" for something like $5-10 million.</p><p>But the movie ended up making $160 million in China, half of its total global box office. The producer did have a secondary deal lined up but their bottom line definitely missed out. </p><p>The other option is the one most often chosen by the big studios. This is a revenue sharing agreement where a Chinese distribution and exhibition partner takes 75%. The film importer gets about 25% of revenue. </p><p>Most of the big American blockbusters like Venom and the Avengers are released this way. 25% is less than the 40% that American films get elsewhere, but hey it is better than nothing, right? </p><p>The catch is that only a few movies a year get released like this. Right now, that quota is 34. Furthermore, the rules for receiving a quota slot are vague and up to the whims of the government.</p><p>The final type of market entry is a co-production. This is where the American film studio works directly in conjunction with a Chinese partner. This also requires a great deal of Chinese partner involvement and script approval, but the revenue share is much higher. </p><p>For instance, the Meg - a shark movie co-production masterpiece between Warner Brothers and China Media Capital&#8217;s Gravity Pictures. This is the largest grossing US-China co-production of all time with $527 million global gross. </p><h2>Entering the Market </h2><p>Hollywood has been selling films to China for decades. The first 25% revenue sharing film was the Fugitive from Warner Brothers, released in 1994. </p><p>For many years since then, Hollywood treated China as any other international distribution market. That changed as China opened more screens and Chinese people got more used to watching more films. Chinese box offices grew. For some films, China grossed a third or more of the total haul. </p><p>This caught producers' attention. And from there, you start to see a few scattered efforts to localize American films for the China market. This might mean including more Chinese elements into the plot, casting a Chinese person in the film, or modifying the film to please audience tastes. </p><p>For instance, there is a Chinese space station in the film Gravity. In Zootopia, they swapped one of the characters from a moose into a panda. </p><p>There is little evidence that these tweaks really help American blockbusters do better in the China market. And that is why American studios have pursued co-productions, partnerships and even acquisitions. </p><p>For instance, Legendary Pictures - which had been involved in the Dark Knight trilogy, the new Godzilla movies and Dune - selling itself to Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda in 2016. Or the aforementioned co-production Meg. Or the 2017 classic with Matt Damon, Great Wall. </p><p>None of these efforts have really panned out either. Perhaps in time, they could have resulted in better access and more successful product. But then, domestic competition caught up. </p><h2>China&#8217;s Liberalizing Market </h2><p>I think there is a tendency to dismiss Chinese-made movies as being boring propaganda pieces made by the government to stir up anti-Western froth. </p><p>Those do sometimes come out. For instance, the 2009 "Founding of a Republic", 2011 "Founding of a Party", and 2017 "Founding of an Army". So far as I know, these were produced in close collaboration with the Party. </p><p>But those movies did not do particularly well in the market despite boasting star-studded casts and favorable placements. Founding of an Army did just $60 million in the box office. Not a total flop, but not amazing either. </p><p>The reality of the contemporary Chinese movie market is that it is as market driven and dynamic as America&#8217;s. Over the past decade, the Chinese government gradually liberalized its domestic cinema market to the point where even the Party&#8217;s heavily backed films need to compete against other fare. </p><p>If you look at the top grossing movies in the Chinese market, you see the highest spots taken up by products from privately owned studios. </p><p>The way that liberalization happened is not by allowing more foreign movies into the market. But rather, by nurturing a China movie studio industry capable of making movies that are just as or even more popular with audiences as an American Avengers flick. </p><h2>Hong Kong </h2><p>It is hard to develop a domestic industry capable of standing up to existing foreign competition without some foreign technology transfer. But for the most part, as I mentioned, there remains a divide between Hollywood and China. </p><p>With a few rare exceptions, you have not seen American filmmakers go over to China. For instance, Wolf Warrior 2, the 2017 $875 million box office hit, consulted with the Russo Brothers through their Anthem &amp; Song startup studio. </p><p>This divide is in part due to the sheer logistical and cultural challenges involved. For instance, the making of the aforementioned flop Great Wall required 100+ translators, problem-solving conflicts between the two staffs, and the crafting of a story that somehow accommodated both Eastern and Western characters appearing together. </p><p>The Chinese domestic film industry has learned a whole lot more from working with Hong Kong. Hong Kong film has thrived ever since the 1970s, exporting films admired by audiences worldwide. Jackie Chan, Shaw Brothers, etc. The Hong Kong cinema industry is widely respected. I still like Infernal Affairs. </p><p>Starting in 2004, the Chinese government passed new measures to allow Hong Kong film companies greater access to the China market. HK companies can bypass the quota and take more of the box office proceeds. </p><p>Hong Kong-China productions surged to record highs, more than 30 films a year. Major early successes include Stephen Chow's the Mermaid (2016), Operation Red Sea (2018), and Monster Hunt (2015). Chinese companies rapidly gained production skills, a box office track record, and most importantly, talented people. </p><p>For instance, Andrew Lau, co-director of Infernal Affairs. He helmed the aforementioned Founding of an Army. His next project is a movie about Wuhan&#8217;s doctors during the pandemic. </p><h2>The Rise of China</h2><p>The second half of the 2010s has seen some massive domestic blockbuster hits by China-only private studios. Three in particular are indicative of the culture&#8217;s tastes. </p><p>The first is China&#8217;s latest box office hit: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle_at_Lake_Changjin">The Battle at Lake Changjin</a>. This $200 million movie is China's first stab at premium Hollywood blockbuster filmmaking. It is based on the Battle of Chosin Reservoir during the Korean War. </p><div id="youtube2-vtqS2mxDkWw" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;vtqS2mxDkWw&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vtqS2mxDkWw?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>Together with movies like Operation Red Sea and the Eight Hundred <em><strong>(see the video embedded above for that movie&#8217;s story)</strong></em>, this category of action blockbuster is always popular with domestic audiences. That being said, I do not think this type of movie is going to play well abroad. </p><p>The second is China&#8217;s biggest science fiction hit ever: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wandering_Earth">The Wandering Earth</a>. Based on a story by Liu Cixin, who wrote the Three Body Problem, it follows a group of scientists who try to push the Earth to Alpha Centauri with 12,000 rockets. </p><p>It is notable for being picked up by Netflix for streaming - meeting a critical criteria. If third parties start buying and distributing it, that is export discipline at work. </p><p>Side note. Wu Jing starred in this. He was also in the Battle at Lake Changjin and Wolf Warrior 2. Dude must be the biggest movie star that nobody in the West has ever heard of. </p><p><em><strong>Author&#8217;s note:</strong></em><strong> </strong><em><strong>Below is an old Asianometry video review of Wolf Warrior 2</strong></em></p><div id="youtube2-Ap4jY4vvA7c" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;Ap4jY4vvA7c&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ap4jY4vvA7c?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>And finally, China&#8217;s big animation hit film: Ne Zha. The movie features a protection deity from traditional Chinese folk religion and is loosely based on a 16th century novel. Despite not featuring any known actors, the movie made $742 million in the box office. </p><p>Animation is a powerful and lucrative category. Families love them, and they can be made at lower cost than live action flicks. Illumination Entertainment, for instance, made Despicable Me 3 for $80 million and it returned a billion dollars in the global box office. </p><h2>The Five Year Plan </h2><p>Recently, the China Film Administration released its Five Year Plan for the country's domestic film industry. It is worth studying as it gives a glimpse into future policy. </p><p>The Plan notes that China is expected to have 100,000 theater screens by 2025. This is over twice as many as the 44,000 in the United States. Theaters have become a critical part of Chinese culture. </p><p>The first major goal would be to improve the quality of the movie going experience. For theaters, that means promoting better cinema technologies. For instance, IMAX. China is one of IMAX's biggest markets, but there are a few domestic competitors. </p><p>For instance, Poly Pictures in 2011 introduced a competing standard of theater technology called POLYMAX. Another format is China Film Giant Screen. Neither have really caught on. </p><h2>A Strong Film Power </h2><p>With 100,000 theater screens in the coming years, the plan calls for the domestic film industry to provide a supply of content for them to show. And in the process, turn China into a "strong film power" that regularly exports movies that promote Chinese spirit, values, and power. </p><p>Kind of like what South Korea has done with its film and cultural exports. </p><p>Numerically, it calls for fifty domestic movies with a box office of at least $15 million USD (100 million RMB). Domestic films need to maintain 55% box office share of the China market. </p><p>Very achievable considering that local films were taking 60+% share even before the pandemic cut off the flow of Hollywood films. </p><p>When it comes to plots, the Plan calls out movies covering Chinese history, party history, reform and opening. </p><p>A sequel to Battle at Lake Changjin starring Andy Lau and Wu Jing is already being prepped. </p><p>Historical events of note include the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II. So I am really hoping the Party approves that Asianometry spec script I submitted last week.</p><p>Additionally, they called out science-fiction and animation films. Battle at Lake Changjin grossed over $800 million USD, but I think policymakers recognize that those movies won't play well abroad. </p><p>By contrast, movies like the Wandering Earth and Ne Zha have more global appeal and export potential. More chances to display China's strengths and values. </p><h2>Special Effects and VFX </h2><p>The most interesting bit is the plan's focus on special effects. Expensive blockbusters have ambitious set pieces built on advanced visual effects. Only the United States is able to release more than a handful of these CGI-heavy blockbusters each year. </p><p>The Battle of Lake Changjin featured 575 VFX shots and 100+ assets. The Wandering Earth had 216 VFX shots and 100+ assets as well. </p><p>Delivering those effects will cost an immense amount of financial investment. But if the numbers for the Chinese box office are to be believed, there is more than enough money sloshing around to fund that. Though I am really curious what&#8217;s going to happen when these pioneering studios inevitably start producing their first big budget flops. </p><div id="youtube2-3M-7FJe4KFA" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;3M-7FJe4KFA&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3M-7FJe4KFA?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>Side note. Something that really fascinates me is how much of those millions of dollars do the creatives see? Ne Zha made over 35x its budget. We all heard of Hollywood accounting. Is there a Chinese version of that too? Who got rich from this? The studios? The theaters? Just wondering. </p><h2>Conclusion </h2><p>Hollywood is and still will be the dominant entertainment capital. They eventually found a way to replace those declining DVD revenues with direct-to-consumer streaming. And I think streaming will be the money train really feeding all of these production companies going forward. </p><p>Furthermore, I think American films are going to hold strong market share for the foreseeable future. I don&#8217;t think Chinese films will ever get to be as popular in the USA as much as American films are enjoyed in China. </p><p>Overseas, the story is different. It is not hard to imagine a world where a film like Godzilla versus King Kong or the Minions has to compete with a Chinese film like the Wandering Earth 2 or Ne Zha for limited theater slots in Indonesia or Mexico or elsewhere. </p><p>For the longest time, only Hollywood was capable of making Hollywood-scale films. The China film industry is looking to change that.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://asianometry.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share The Asianometry Newsletter&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://asianometry.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share The Asianometry Newsletter</span></a></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How Carl Zeiss Crafted a House of Mirrors for EUV Light ]]></title><description><![CDATA[Merry Christmas, everyone Author&#8217;s Note: If you want to watch the video, you can below I have nothing to add to this video except to complain that I had a huge headache writing it.

It is a disruptive technology using a new ultraviolet wavelength. </p><p>Dutch company ASML is currently the only company shipping these million dollar machines. But ASML in turn relies on Carl Zeiss in Germany for the all-important optics system. The two are intimate strategic partners. </p><p>The key issue that ASML and Carl Zeiss engineers had to overcome is that high-energy UV light gets absorbed by virtually all materials, which means that lenses are not feasible. The lens material will literally just eat up those rays. Thus, Zeiss crafted an optics system entirely out of multi-layer mirrors. </p><p>It is super cool. In my last video I gave a brief overview of Carl Zeiss the company and a few of their products. In this follow up, we are going to go deeper and look at how Zeiss made a EUV optics system.</p><p>## The EUV Optics System, Outrageously Simplified </p><p>Let me start with this. I am not a vision scientist and the technical details behind the EUV Starlith 3000 systems are some of the most mind-bending stuff I have ever read. </p><p>I collected the details for this video from over 30 conference presentations academic theses, and industry papers on the topic. Forgive me for any errors that I will inevitably make here. </p><p>Here are the basics. The Starlith 3000 series is a multi-component optics system consisting of the collector optics, an aperture, illumination optics, reticle, and projection optics. We will go over what those individual components actually do later. </p><p>The light source is where it all begins. I discussed how such EUV light is created in my previous video about ASML's supply chain. So let's skip the heavy details. For now, all you need to know is that they use lasers and tin plasma to generate high energy EUV light. </p><p>Once the light is generated, it needs to be collected. And that's what the collector does. </p><p>## The Collector</p><p>The Collector Optics system is set up to collect as much EUV light as possible from the source and transfer those photons to the next module in the Starlith system. </p><p>In order to do this, it is made in the shape of an ellipsoid, kind of like a car headlight lamp. The only gaps in the mirror would be for the laser and the tin droplets. </p><p>Figuring out the collector's shape was not the only challenge engineers had to overcome. They also had to make sure it stays clean and functional. </p><p>The collector is uniquely difficult in that it is exposed to molten tin plasma from the EUV light source. This leads to its inevitable deterioration. But in order for EUV to be economically viable, ASML customers like TSMC, Intel, or Samsung should only have to replace the collector once each year or every 3000 exposure hours.</p><p>To protect the mirror, Zeiss engineers took a two fold approach. </p><p>First, they attempted to prevent layers of tin from forming on the collector mirrors. They created a buffer zone of inert gas and employed magnetics to discourage ions away from the mirrors. </p><p>But no matter what, tin will get to the collector and form a layer on it. And a tin layer of just 1.2 nanometers thick will cause a 20% decline in collector efficiency and a 10% decline in tool output. </p><p>Thus, Zeiss engineers had to figure out a way to constantly clean it right inside the machine. As often as every 2 hours or less, as according to studies of the alpha demo tool. </p><p>The way they figured out how to do it was to send hydrogen radicals at the tin layers. Radicals, to jog your memory from chemistry class, are atoms or molecules with one unpaired electron. </p><p>Their unpaired electron makes these things quite reactive. Thus, these hydrogen radicals will react with the tin, floating away from the mirror in the form of a gas called tin hydride. </p><p>This cleaning does not stop the collector's deterioration. Merely delays it. It is inevitable. But it did help Zeiss get substantially closer to its one replacement a year goal and overcome one of EUV&#8217;s major obstacles. </p><p>## The Illuminator</p><p>After the UV light is collected, it is sent into the optics system through an aperture at intermediate focus. Then it enters the illuminator system.</p><p>The illuminator has two big jobs. Its first job is to evenly spread out the EUV light so that it remains uniform across the entire field of focus. </p><p>Second, it ensures that the image of the EUV light source does not affect the rest of the optics system. </p><p>Zeiss drew on their extensive experience building similar products for optical microscopes to deliver this very special component. </p><h2>The Reticle </h2><p>After that, the light hits the mask or reticle, which contains the IC chip's patterns. Uniquely, this reticle is itself a mirror. </p><p>When you get to these sizes, the information on the reticle is extremely dense. The ASML NXE:3400B, an EUV machine, has a field size of 33 millimeters by 26 millimeters. This is quite large. </p><p>To put it into perspective. Let us call a single 13 nanometer by 13 nanometer square a pixel. Now if that pixel was to be blown up to the size of a pixel in a regular full HD TV, then the television would be 17,622 meters high. </p><p>That would be 50% taller than Taipei 101. And that entire television screen would be filled edge to edge with the chip designs of something like a Intel Core i7.</p><p>Conceptually at a high level, this mirror reticle is made up of two things: The first is a highly reflective multi-layer mirror substrate called a reticle blank. </p><p>The second is an absorbing layer applied on top of it containing the chip design pattern. The light bounces off the mirror and makes an EUV shadow. </p><p>With the reticle, Carl Zeiss focused on two big fundamental challenges. The first is making sure that the reticle blank is as clean and reflective as possible. ASML asked that the blank should have only 0.003 defects per square centimeter. </p><p>The second major challenge was how to detect and repair the reticle when defects do arise. Blank or absorber-related defects will happen no matter what. These have to be detected and repaired.</p><p>In the optics system for the 193nm DUV lithography generation, defects are detected with a scanning electron microscope. Easy. </p><p>For EUV, they needed to do more as some types of reticle defects are invisible to an electron microscope. So Zeiss took that machine and added to it an atomic force microscope, a probe device that scans by sort of running its "finger probes" across the surface of a sample. That is the best way I can put it. </p><p>This new machine is now capable of dynamically switching between electron microscope and atomic force microscope to find defects the other cannot.</p><p>Once a defect is detected, repairs are done using electron beam processing. It is kind of like welding at an atomic level, where a precursor is laid on the sample and then struck with a beam of electrons from an electron gun. Depending on the type of defect, you can either add more absorber or etch away absorber. </p><p>And oh yeah, the repair has to be entirely done autonomously in a vacuum to prevent any contamination. The Zeiss MeRiT system is able to meet all of these requirements and helped overcome one of the more daunting challenges in EUV commercialization. That being said, the costs of entry for producing an EUV reticle are expected to be prohibitive for all but the richest of companies. </p><h2>The Projector </h2><p>Don't these titles all sound like really poorly named professional wrestlers?</p><p>Anyhow. The Projector optic system is a multi-mirror system designed to expand out the reticle image and project it onto the wafer. </p><p>It is crucial that aberrations on the projector optics are reduced as much as possible. At first, the mirrors that Zeiss created for the ASML alpha demo tool's projector back in 2010 had very slight, but significant defects. </p><p>These defects are measured in a unit called surface-rms, or the root mean square average of the profile height deviations from the line. Too much of a surface-rms leads to what is essentially the microlithography version of lens flare. </p><p>Most of us just know lens flare as that thing that J.J. Abrams really likes to put into his movies. But what it actually is is an image artifact that comes as a result of scattered light in a lens system. </p><p>Unlike with the esteemed work of J.J. Abrams, flare causes defects on the wafer and thus, is unwanted. </p><p>The 2010 alpha demo tool had a surface rms of 0.25 nanometers, leading to a 25% flare, which was unacceptable. In order to get the flare down, the mirror aberrations had to be substantially reduced. Something they managed to achieve over the multiple generations of the Starlith EUV system. </p><p>So let us talk about the mirrors then. </p><h2>The Mirrors </h2><p>As you might expect for a system made of mirrors, Carl Zeiss paid very close attention to how those mirrors were made. The mirrors are so important that they were the reason why the whole enterprise chose to work with the 13.5nm spectrum of EUV light.  </p><p>It was a decision between the 11.3 to 11.6 nm wavelength using molybdenum and beryllium mirrors or the 13.5nm wavelength with molybdenum and silicon mirrors. In the end they chose the latter.</p><p>And as you might expect, these are not your ordinary bedroom mirrors. These are multi-layer mirrors. Sometimes also called Bragg Reflectors. </p><p>Your traditional mirror is usually made by applying a layer of silver or aluminum onto glass. </p><p>An EUV mirror on the other hand is made up of over 50 pairs of molybdenum and silicon layers deposited on top of a single silicon wafer. Each of those layers within the pair is about 6.75 to 7 nanometers thick. 2.7 nm of molybdenum and 4.1 nanometers of silicon.</p><p>You want to have all of these layers because the EUV light is still going to pass through some of them. So you have more layers, with the hope of reflecting as much EUV as possible. </p><p>The silicon and molybdenum atomic layers are applied using a technique called Direct Current Magnetron sputtering. This is a type of thin film physical vapor deposition, something I talked about in my video about Tokyo Electron. </p><div id="youtube2-8FK_wV3x9WY" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;8FK_wV3x9WY&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8FK_wV3x9WY?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>So to make these EUV mirrors, each 2 to 4 nanometer layer of molybdenum and silicon has to be deposited one by one. Fifty times, without fatal defects. </p><p>After that, each mirror has to be painstakingly polished. The acceptable surface deviation metric is 50 picometers, or 50 trillionths of a meter. That is a staggering number. </p><p>To put that into perspective. 50 picometers on a mirror that is 450 millimeters wide. If that 450 millimeter mirror was blown up to the size of the United States, 4,500 kilometers or 2,800 miles wide, then 50 picometers would be just 0.5 mm tall. </p><p>In DC Magnetron sputtering, you want to layer a coating onto a surface. You bombard the coating with ionized gas molecules. Those molecules "sputter" off atoms which then condense as a thin film onto the surface.</p><p>Even with all that, each mirror can theoretically reflect just around 70% of the EUV light that hits it. The rest is absorbed by the multilayer. And it can only achieve that number at a very specific angle, requiring exquisite equipment to position it just right. </p><p>Considering there are so many mirrors across the entire optics system, you can appreciate the challenge that ASML engineers face in getting enough power through to the wafer. </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The thing about this EUV optics system that I keep marveling at is just how radically different it is from its predecessor. It is much like the shift from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles. </p><p>The vapor deposition techniques behind multi-layer mirror alone took over 20 years of research. It required close collaboration between ASML, Carl Zeiss, Philips, and various universities and institutes across Europe. </p><p>To have been able to deliver something like this is a stunning achievement, the culmination of thousands of years of man-hours. Throughout this video, I hope that I have impressed upon you that notion, that understanding of just how difficult it was.</p><div><hr></div><p>Feel free to share the newsletter if you are interested. </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://asianometry.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share The Asianometry Newsletter&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://asianometry.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share The Asianometry Newsletter</span></a></p><p>And follow the <a href="https://twitter.com/asianometry">Twitter too</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Peek into Southern Taiwan’s Tech Scene ]]></title><description><![CDATA[Visiting the Meet Greater South Show]]></description><link>https://asianometry.substack.com/p/a-peek-into-southern-taiwans-tech</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://asianometry.substack.com/p/a-peek-into-southern-taiwans-tech</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jon Y]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 07:00:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/JV2gof9E8jY" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>If you want to see the video first, it is below: </em></p><div id="youtube2-JV2gof9E8jY" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;JV2gof9E8jY&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JV2gof9E8jY?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>Recently, I had the opportunity to attend the Meet Global South exhibition in the southern city of Kaohsiung. </p><p>This show is for showcasing tech opportunities and companies relating to Taiwan's southern regions. </p><p>In this vlog, I want to report on my experiences at the show, a few highlights, and some of the challenges southern Taiwan&#8217;s tech scene faces in the future. </p><h2>About the Show </h2><p>The show took place at the Kaohsiung Exhibition Center. While the Meet Taipei exhibition had been done for several years, this is the first time they did a show in Taiwan's south. </p><p>The show's overarching themes focused on 5G, AIOT and data intelligence. AIOT standing for "artificial intelligence of things". </p><p>The idea is that you use AI technology to achieve smoother human-machine interactions between people and their gadgets. </p><p>For instance, something like a sweeper robot that using various sensors and a data connection to find spots to clean - I guess would be an example of AIOT. </p><p>I have to admit however, it seems like only a few of these companies followed this overarching theme. In other booths you saw companies talking about the metaverse, augmented reality, and other random tech trending stuff. </p><p>On the left side of the exhibition floor, you had the larger booths. Big companies like AWS and Chunghwa Telecom rented out large spaces. </p><p>And like with the Taipei event, some organizations like the Taiwan Tech Arena rented out a large space and invited startups in their portfolio to take a slot. </p><p>On the right, you had various startups operating in various categories. Blockchain, Entertainment, Digital Content, and Regional Revitalization. </p><p>I want to go through some of my personal favorites in the exhibition - starting with those large companies. </p><h2>Big Companies</h2><p>China Steel (CSC Group, as it is called) was Taiwan's state-owned steel company, now publicly traded. It is still the world's 28th largest steel maker. The 11th outside of China. </p><p>They exhibited some of their robotics technology, which I think was pretty impressive. The company is a heavy user of automation, with FANUC robots a common sight at their facilities. </p><p>Two other large companies - Chunghwa Telecom and Taipower - came to the show. Chunghwa is another former state-owned company and they brought all the keywords. </p><p>The latter is the state utility. I will be frank in saying that I didn&#8217;t much understand what their booths were talking about or how they fit in the show&#8217;s themes since everything was in Chinese. </p><p>However, the big company everyone at the show was talking about did not attend at all. A few months ago, TSMC announced that they would be building their first facility in Kaohsiung at the site of a former refinery once owned by Taiwan's oil company CPC. </p><p>TSMC already has a sizable southern presence with its titanic facility in my hometown of Tainan. This would be the first time they are going to build anything in Kaohsiung, and naturally it was the talk of the town. </p><p>It was mentioned in all the keynotes given by the various government officials at the opening ceremony. And in fact I constantly overheard the company&#8217;s name in everyday conversation throughout my time in Kaohsiung. </p><h2>Research and Government</h2><p>The government had a sizable presence at the show. For instance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs caught my attention with a cool looking light box tech demo thing meant for virtual in-person conferencing. I watched the lady demonstrate it for a while. </p><p>However, my favorite booth to visit belonged to the <a href="https://www.itri.org.tw/english/">Industrial Technology Research Institute</a> or ITRI. They are most famous for spinning off TSMC and UMC. But after visiting their booth, I felt that the institution had a lot more to offer than that legacy. </p><p>For instance, they showed me this interesting oven. It is kind of like an improved air fryer capable of heating up food a variety of different ways so to create the best tasting result. </p><p>I tried their fried chicken example and it tasted great. I mean, fried food always tastes great. But anyway, I asked them what they were going to do with it. And the project manager told me that the team was going to try to transfer the technology to some Taiwanese companies. Those companies can then commercialize it and start selling it. </p><p>Another ITRI project I spoke to was <a href="https://aidea-web.tw/">AIdea</a>, a startup that is kind of like a Taiwanese version of Kaggle. They help Taiwan's companies incorporate AI into their business by connecting them with data scientists in Taiwanese universities. </p><p>Management told me that their future business model would be to help provide more comprehensive AI services to Taiwan companies. The students doing the data science work would benefit by getting royalties from their top-performing models. </p><p>ITRI's role as an R&amp;D factory that straddles both industry and pure science is pretty unique to me as an American. Can you imagine an American government institution that goes around spinning off startups and acquiring technology for transferring to private companies? Yeah, me neither. </p><h2>Startups</h2><p>About half of the show's floor was dedicated to booths for smaller startups. Much of the show though was driven by the big corporations. And I think that's because this is the first show of the type and word has not really gotten out to the city's smaller companies as of yet. </p><p>The area was rather short on tech startups in the traditional, Silicon Valley, venture funded definition. Most of the companies I had the opportunity to speak to in the startups section of the show were actually from Taipei, looking for sales opportunities in Kaohsiung. </p><p>That being said, there were a few highlights. I was surprised to learn about <a href="https://www.kdanmobile.com/">Kdan Mobile</a>, based in Tainan. This company has a portfolio of mobile productivity apps like Kdan PDF Reader, NoteLedge, and others. They have 200 million downloads and 10 million active users globally. </p><p>This <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/kdan-mobile-gets-16m-series-b-for-its-cloud-based-content-and-productivity-tools/">company recently closed a Series B round</a> and was featured in TechCrunch. I have never heard of this company before, but it makes a lot of sense to me that they make mobile apps. It is an easy way for a company to go global. </p><p>And personally, I enjoyed speaking with two members of a company called <a href="https://www.earthgen.com.tw/">Earthgen Technology</a>. They are a team of 10 people also based in Tainan. They make a flying drone capable of autonomously applying pesticides and seeds to crop fields. </p><p>The two guys are graduates from NCKU, the local prestigious university. And the drone they build in their Tainan warehouse is quite large. It can be controlled by remote or run itself autonomously. </p><p>The small battery inside the drone runs for about 10 minutes, which does not feel all that long but they assured me was enough time considering the payload. The drone is currently being sold to farmers and the local government agency. </p><p>I have been thinking a lot about robotics technology lately and its applications in agriculture and other industrial sectors. Hopefully I can do a bigger video in the future. </p><h2>Conclusion </h2><p>Overall, the show was fun to visit and a good first start. It's a good thing that southern tech startups in Kaohsiung, Chiayi, and Tainan are getting their chance to gain more media prominence. </p><p>However, it is definitely a different type of show - more regional and difficult to understand. For instance, many of the people at the Meet Taipei show spoke English. At the Greater South show, everything was in Chinese. And sometimes even in the Taiwanese dialect, which to me might as well be Arabic. </p><p>In light of this, I think the focus on startups that can "go global" might be a bit too much of a jump. Ironically enough in a city with Taiwan's largest port, Kaohsiung is no gateway for technology companies. And unlike Tainan, the city doesn't host a university of national renown. </p><p>TSMC arriving might change that to some extent. The company is the pride of Taiwan. But there are already a lot of really big companies based in Kaohsiung. </p><p>Like the aforementioned CSC Group and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASE_Group">ASE Group</a>, the world's largest provider of semiconductor assembly services. Names alone won&#8217;t help establish a new industrial cluster to help the city move beyond its rust belt reputation. </p><p>More policy work needs to be done to help upgrade the area's technological and entrepreneurial profile. But this is a good start.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Asianometry Reacts to a Trash Article]]></title><description><![CDATA["Taiwan's intent to decouple from us?"]]></description><link>https://asianometry.substack.com/p/taiwans-intent-to-decouple-from-us</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://asianometry.substack.com/p/taiwans-intent-to-decouple-from-us</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jon Y]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 13 Dec 2021 17:00:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F247a2695-93e7-4603-9077-95c3453f5822_1932x1174.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few people have sent this one article to me, asking about whether it is a huge deal or not.

But I want to break down exactly why it is terrible, so that you know what tactics writers use to get you. I know, because I have to think about this stuff when writing titles for videos. </p><p>I have some problems with this terrible title: &#8220;Taiwan chipmakers <strong>hint</strong> at decoupling from the US&#8221;. The use of the word &#8220;<strong>hint</strong>&#8221; is an informational <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern">dark pattern</a>. It adds a bit of insidiousness to the whole topic, a silent threat. It motivates the user to click because it implies that there is something happening behind their back. </p><h2>Lies From the Start</h2><p>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence to back it up. If it is not provided, then you should dismiss it outright. Just utter trash. </p><p>This is the first line from the Trash Article: </p><blockquote><p>Taiwan&#8217;s chip fabricators signed an agreement on December 3 to create their own semiconductor equipment industry, opening an &#8220;option to decouple from the West,&#8221; in the view of a prominent US research firm.</p></blockquote><p>Let&#8217;s go look at the actual source article from Taipei Times. It says: </p><blockquote><p>Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International Taiwan president Terry Tsao, Taiwan Machine Tool &amp; Accessory Builders&#8217; Association chairman Habor Hsu and Taiwan Electronic Equipment Industry Association chairman Laurie Wang, as well as Vice Premier Shen Jong-chin, second row second left, and Deputy Legislative Speaker Tsai Chi-chang, second row second right, attend the signing of a memorandum of understanding in Taipei yesterday to promote the localization of semiconductor equipment production.</p></blockquote><p>Note the actual organizations. Taiwan&#8217;s big two chipmakers are TSMC and UMC. I don&#8217;t see TSMC and UMC in the above. <strong>That is because the writer lied about that.</strong> </p><p>They are positioning this as &#8220;TSMC and UMC are developing their own semiconductor equipment to cut off the US&#8221;. The reality is: &#8220;Some nonprofit industrial groups in Taiwan focused on selling <strong>hardware and tools</strong> are interested in getting a piece of the semiconductor tools pie&#8221;  </p><p>Why on earth would TSMC want to decouple from the United States? </p><ul><li><p>Their stock is dual-listed in the United States. </p></li><li><p>Many of their top <a href="https://www.chu.berkeley.edu/">researchers</a> live in the United States right now. </p></li><li><p>They are literally building their second American fab - in Arizona. </p></li><li><p>Morris Chang is an American citizen. </p><ul><li><p>I recall that one of their current CEO or Chairman - don&#8217;t recall which - is an American citizen</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Just utter trash. </p></li></ul><p>The writer has two basic sources . The first, I already spoke about. The second is below: </p><blockquote><p>Industry analyst Dan Hutchison of the semiconductor research group VSLI wrote on December 8 that a home-grown chip equipment industry &#8220;would make it possible for Taiwan to decouple from the West.

And sloppy too. </p><h2>Targeting America </h2><p>Normally, that would be enough for me but I am feeling particularly bitter today. The article specifically targets America and ignores that Taiwan is buying the majority of their equipment from Europe and Japan: </p><blockquote><p>The two top providers of chip-making equipment, Applied Materials and LAM, both are American. Tokyo Electron, Japan&#8217;s largest equipment maker, increased its China sales from 50 billion yen ($441 million) in 2015 to 400 billion yen this year. </p></blockquote><p>It is funny that they would call Applied Materials and LAM Research the two top providers of chip-making equipment and forget that ASML, Nikon or Canon exist. Lithography makes up to 70% of the value of the equipment sitting inside those TSMC clean rooms. None of the companies making that are American. </p><p>America hasn&#8217;t done lithography equipment since the first Indiana Jones movie. If Taiwan&#8217;s chipmakers are decoupling from anyone when they go and develop their own chip equipment, they are decoupling from Europe or Japan. Which they are not. Great video about this down there. </p><div id="youtube2-rjQMcWqLJug" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;rjQMcWqLJug&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rjQMcWqLJug?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>As for the second part of the paragraph, the sentence notes that Tokyo Electron sells so much stuff to China.

In this video, we will talk about the company, an interesting glimpse into China&#8217;s plans for its renewables industry. </p><h2>Intro to Three Gorges New Energy </h2><p>The name is a little deceiving. The business unit does not actually own or operate the Three Gorges dam. More like branding, I think. </p><p>The operations associated with the company's eponymous dam belong to a sibling company - China Yangtze Power. </p><p>Rather, Three Gorges New Energy builds and operates wind and solar farms. It had once been a state-owned corporation within the Ministry of Water Resources working on water conservation methods. </p><p>Three Gorges Corporation then bought it and for whatever reason turned it into their renewable energy resources vehicle. The company still has some very small hydropower projects left. </p><p>Wind provides about 55% of revenue. Onshore about 47%, and offshore about 8%. Solar provides most of the rest - about 44%. </p><h2>About Three Gorges Corporation, the Majority Owner</h2><p>Three Gorges New Energy is 74.9% directly and indirectly owned by China Three Gorges Corporation. I am going to call it CTG for the sake of brevity. </p><p>CTG is a power industry development company. When the Party decided that it was going to build a dam across the Three Gorges, they established CTG to do the construction. </p><p>After the dam was completed, CTG then founded another subsidiary, China Yangtze Power, to operate and receive the cash flows from the Three Gorges dam. </p><p>Yangtze also operates other dams on the Yangtze River, including the Xiluodu and Xiangjiaba dam. </p><p>Yangtze Power now publicly trades on the Shanghai stock market, under the ticker symbol 600900. As of this writing, the company's market cap is 449 billion RMB or $69 billion USD. It yields an annual dividend of 3.57%. </p><p>When I first read about this structure, I had thought it a little weird. Why two subsidiaries? Why didn't CTG simply roll its solar and wind energy plays into Yangtze Energy? Yangtze is already a large, well-established public company, after all. </p><p>I cannot pretend to know what they are thinking, but I reckon that it has to do with policy and growth. The Chinese government is pushing the development of "new energy" sources. It classifies "new energy" as wind, solar, tidal, and "water power without regulation capability", whatever that means.</p><p>Hydropower is not included, and so does not receive the same feed-in tariffs. So it's not a growth stock. It makes sense. China is the most dammed country in the world. They have been damming since the days of Mao. Not that many more dams to build. </p><p>The two companies' PE ratios as of this writing reflect this. Three Gorges New Energy has a 38.8 ratio, while Yangtze has 16. </p><h2>Expansion </h2><p>Anyway, back to Three Gorges New Energy. The utility has been expanding its portfolio quite rapidly. </p><p>In 2008, the company had about 143 megawatts of installed capacity. At the end of Sept 2020, that number has grown 12x over to 11,900 megawatts. An annual growth rate of 45.7%. </p><p>This trend is expected to continue as China's 14th Five-Year Plan dictates the quadrupling of total installed renewable energy capacity from 2021 to 2025. </p><p>Currently, the company has projects in 30 provinces, autonomous areas, and municipalities across the country. </p><p>The majority of its revenue derives from China's north, northwest, and east. </p><h2>Offshore Wind and Solar </h2><p>The Party has set a path for China to be a leader in offshore wind energy. Thus, this is a special focus for the company. Three Gorges New Energy is in the midst of "unswervingly implementing the strategy" as they so often like to say in Chinese media. </p><p>The company estimates that by the end of 2020, total installed and in-production capacity of offshore wind power will reach 4,270 megawatts. </p><p>Which, assuming they hit that number, would be as much as what Japan has in total overall installed wind capacity. </p><p>Offshore wind projects are more complicated than their onshore counterparts. They require engineers to deal with confounding factors like sudden severe weather, icing issues, deep waters, and complex sea floor topography. </p><p>This is the company's chosen core competency, so they are doing the end-to-end installation all by themselves. It has required them to build, amongst other things, China's first indigenous submarine cables and sea booster stations, a kind of dredging machine. </p><p>The company has also been doing some interesting things to best make use of old coal mine infrastructure. </p><p>In the city of Huainan in the Anhui Province, the company has set up a 150 megawatt floating solar installation in the Panyi Coal Mine. </p><p>China's policy goals for offshore wind - a clear cutting edge renewable technology - and how they are achieving them are worth reviewing in a future video. Remind me to do that one later. </p><h2>Industry Dynamics: Costs and Margins</h2><p>We can boil down the renewable energy industry into three large sections: the upstream components makers, the mid-stream manufacturers, and the downstream end users. </p><p>As I wrote about in my video about China's solar efforts, the renewable energy industry's value chain between these three sectors kind of looks like a horseshoe. </p><div id="youtube2-QoCoPmtNRJo" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;QoCoPmtNRJo&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QoCoPmtNRJo?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>Upstream component makers often hold very specialized knowledge and thus can charge high margins for their work. Downstream providers hold the critical customer relationship. </p><p>Mid-stream makers are worst off between the three - they are first in line to eat price cuts when things go bad. </p><p>Three Gorges New Energy used to manufacture and sell their own wind turbines, but in 2017 they withdrew from this business and fully committed to developing power generation plants. A great decision. </p><p>The company has gross margins approaching 60%. Furthermore, these margins are rising year after year, a trend that roughly begins after the 2017 decision to withdraw from turbine manufacturing. </p><p>We can also tie these rising gross margins to cheaper wind turbines. The company procures them from two major suppliers - Xinjiang Goldwind and Mingyang Smart Energy - and Three Gorges appears to be holding their feet to the fire. </p><p>This trend can't last forever. At some point, we are going to hit some red line where turbine and solar costs cannot decline any further. Until then, it looks like the utility gets to reap the benefits of the improving economies. </p><h2>Industry Dynamics: Revenue</h2><p>On the revenue side, electricity prices are regulated by their local government. The exact dynamics are quite complicated and differ from province to province.</p><p>For instance, in Sichuan from November to May, there is a regulated government price. From June to October, electricity is sold at market. </p><p>In Yunnan, electricity is always sold at market price, unregulated it appears. I guess Yunnan is like the Texas of China. </p><p>I reckon that the utility is losing money when the government sets the price. </p><div id="youtube2-HS7fdG925UA" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;HS7fdG925UA&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HS7fdG925UA?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>Probably the best way Three Gorges New Energy can deal with this uncertainty is to diversify into as many provinces as possible. And this seems to be the case thus far. </p><p>However, the number of areas with ideal solar and wind properties is limited. As more of these get built out, the marginal benefit of the next site declines, hurting their overall profitability. </p><p>Furthermore, the Chinese government has started to work in additional competition into the market. Policy-makers are starting to reduce feed-in tariffs for wind and solar, which shrinks the whole pie for everyone in the industry. Three Gorges is well positioned here, being a state-owned enterprise, to develop on the best sites, but being an SOE is no golden ticket in China. </p><h2>Comparisons </h2><p>Other companies in this space include Jingke Technology, Jiaze New Energy, and Jiangsu New Energy. Their gross margins are in the same neighborhood or better, but none have the same size or scale. Nor are they backed by a state-owned entity. </p><p>Out in the United States, it is tough to pin down a close comparison for Three Gorges New Energy. People invest in utilities all the time. But these massive companies - Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, and such - are quite old school and are not pure New Energy plays anyway. </p><p>Renewable energy sources might be a significant part of their power generation portfolio, but they still rely on non-renewable or hydroelectric power for a big chunk of their revenue. </p><p>The closest analogue that I can find is NextEra Energy Partners, which is a publicly traded limited partnership subsidiary of NextEra Energy. NextEra is one of the largest electric utilities in the United States and was formerly known as Florida Power &amp; Light. </p><p>But you cannot compare this one with Three Gorges because 1) NextEra is a limited partnership and there are investor tax implications associated with that clouding the stock&#8217;s true value, and 2) NextEra derives a significant portion of revenue from natural gas pipelines. It's not a pure play renewables stock. </p><h2>Conclusion </h2><p>IPO'ing this subsidiary was an interesting play by Three Gorges Corporation. </p><p>Fundamentally, Three Gorges New Energy is a utility company operating in a favorable macro-space. It has a few key advantages in this space. These are capital-intensive projects, and this company is suited for deploying lots of safe capital thanks to its state ties. </p><p>The company is focusing on a core competency of developing and operating renewable power plants. They are trying to build up a special competitive edge in offshore wind - and possibly offshore solar? But let's see about that. So from an operations standpoint, they have their differentiation. </p><p>CTG, the parent company, now has two publicly-traded subsidiaries with strong value for their investor audiences. Yangtze for those wanting income, and now New Energy for those looking for growth. Pretty savvy, I have to say. Now the hard part is for New Energy to deliver on its investors' hopes and dreams.</p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://asianometry.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share The Asianometry Newsletter&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://asianometry.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share The Asianometry Newsletter</span></a></p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
