The writing below summarizes my current perspective based on the research I&#8217;ve performed.</p><h4><em><strong>Section 1 - Investment Thesis</strong></em></h4><p>What are the driving factors behind a potential investment in Olaplex?</p><h4><em><strong>Section 2 - Business Model</strong></em></h4><p>How does Olaplex make money? What is its strategy to grow? Where will future revenue come from?</p><h4><em><strong>Section 3 - Sustainable Competitive Advantages</strong></em></h4><p>What protects Olaplex from incumbents and future competitors?</p><h4><em><strong>Section 4 - Management</strong></em></h4><p>Who decides Olaplex&#8217;s capital allocation strategy? What&#8217;s their background? What are their motivations?</p><h4><em><strong>Section 5 - Valuation and Financials</strong></em></h4><p>Is the market missing anything? Why might there be a disconnect between intrinsic value and Olaplex&#8217;s current price?</p><h4><em><strong>Section 6 - Risks</strong></em></h4><p>What are the major risk items that investors should be aware of?</p><div><hr></div><h4><em><strong>Section 1 - Investment Thesis</strong></em></h4><p>At first glance, Olaplex seems to be a simple DTC business selling haircare products. Under the hood, Olaplex has patents ranging from haircare to skincare and extreme brand loyalty that is still growing. This brand loyalty is being underappreciated by the rest of the market. Olaplex boasts high margins, fast revenue growth, and the potential to continue to grow at an above-average rate.</p><p><strong>Key Thesis Points</strong></p><ul><li><p>Strong, growing, and underappreciated brand</p></li><li><p>Long runway of growth through numerous channels </p></li><li><p>Asset light business with impressive margins</p></li></ul><h4><em><strong>Section 2 - Business Model</strong></em></h4><p>Olaplex sells haircare products through three channels:</p><ul><li><p>Professional</p><ul><li><p>ex. through salon channels</p></li><li><p>46.4% of net sales in Q3</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Specialty Retail</p><ul><li><p>ex. selling through retail stores such as Ulta or Sephora</p></li><li><p>28.7% of net sales in Q3</p></li></ul></li><li><p>DTC</p><ul><li><p>ex. direct to consumer through e-commerce</p></li><li><p>24.9% of net sales in Q3</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>Olaplex has a top-down approach to building its brand. Olaplex focuses on salons and hairstylists in order to get them comfortable with using Olaplex products. Once hairstylists are comfortable with these products, they will start to use them on clients and eventually recommend them to clients. </p><p>In Olaplex&#8217;s investor presentation on page 9 (<a href="https://ir.olaplex.com/static-files/a4748716-29b4-4ba3-afb5-64520b8404cc">link here</a>), recommendations from hairstylists are the leading source for choosing what hair products to use. This is logical and isn&#8217;t just Olaplex promoting their go-to-market strategy. These salon clients then shop for Olaplex products either in brick and mortar retail locations (specialty retail) or order Olaplex products online (DTC). </p><p>The professional channel is the most important to establish Olaplex&#8217;s brand and offering for future customers. Olaplex uses salons to build up the Olaplex brand. Hairdressers help &#8220;distribute&#8221; Olaplex products through their recommendations and hair treatments in salons.</p><p>Olaplex has partnerships with Sephora and Ulta that will grow brand loyalty, revenue, and profits. Olaplex was set to roll out into Ulta stores starting at the beginning of the year.</p><p><strong>Avenues for Growth</strong></p><p>Olaplex CFO, Eric Tiziani, stated that growth will come evenly across three different drivers. These drivers are innovation (new products), new distribution opportunities (new countries/partnerships), and just the core and increased velocity (more penetration into existing customer base).</p><p>I think the growth avenues can also be split up among the following, starting with most likely to least likely:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Increase penetration into salons and hairstylists.</strong></p><p>Olaplex&#8217;s penetration into salons and hairstylists is still relatively small. In Olaplex&#8217;s Q3 2021 earnings call, JuE Wong highlighted that Olaplex&#8217;s Facebook group has around 250,000 hairstylists, but there are more than 800,000 hairstylists in the US. Olaplex needs to continue to grow its hairstylist customer base and also increase the number of products these hairstylists sell to their clients. Olaplex can expand the number of salons using Olaplex products as well as the volume of products that the average salon sells to clients.</p></li><li><p><strong>Expansion in international countries.</strong></p><p>Olaplex has room to grow in other countries despite international already accounting for 42% of revenue in Q3 2021. Management has called out Asia (more specifically China), Latin America (Mexico and Chile), Europe (UK, Spain, and Italy) as key segments for Olaplex&#8217;s future. Although it isn&#8217;t a sure thing, Olaplex has already had success in international countries and its playbook will continue to work. On top of this, management believes international revenue will grow at a slightly faster rate than US revenue.</p></li><li><p><strong>Expansion into adjacent categories like skincare.</strong></p><p>Management has said &#8220;we have patent applications that really have skincare and nailcare application&#8221; which shows their interest in expanding beyond haircare and into other segments of the beauty market. For example, Olaplex has job openings for Chemists focused on skincare. Skincare and haircare are two massive markets with incredible customer loyalty if the products work for the customers. While haircare remains the main focus, Olaplex will continue to look for ways to innovate outside of its core revenue channel of haircare products.</p></li></ul><h4><em><strong>Section 3 - Sustainable Competitive Advantages</strong></em> </h4><p>Olaplex is similar to many consumer companies such as Lululemon, Aritzia, Yeti, and other companies with strong brand loyalty. Research shows that many women are extremely loyal to Olaplex and wouldn&#8217;t consider switching to other products after their experience with Olaplex. </p><p>The additional advantage that Olaplex has is its portfolio of patents that prevent companies from copying their science and technology. Olaplex has sued L'Or&#233;al already for &#8220;trade secret misappropriation, breach of a non-disclosure agreement and patent infringement.&#8221; While Olaplex won the initial ruling, an appeal overturned this victory in December 2021. Olaplex is appealing this decision. While patents are often hard to enforce, Olaplex&#8217;s combination of brand loyalty and portfolio of patents provides a strong moat to competitors.</p><h4><em><strong>Section 4 - Management and Capital Allocation</strong></em></h4><p>Management and capital allocation are the two criteria that need more time to develop for investors to get comfortable with investing in Olaplex. While yes, the management team has done an outstanding job growing Olaplex into a public company with strong revenue growth and outstanding margins, investors will need more time to develop an opinion of Olaplex&#8217;s management team.</p><p>While Olaplex&#8217;s management team may need to prove themselves in the public markets, they have great backgrounds. According to her <a href="https://juewong888.wixsite.com/juewong/resume">resume</a>, CEO JuE Wong has been recruited by numerous private equity firms to lead various companies. While this might be a biased source of information, when combined with the rest of the mosaic, it does add another data point on management.</p><p>CFO Eric Tiziani was CFO of Unilever North America according to his LinkedIn page. This is a good signal. A young executive from an established company wants to jump to a more important role at a younger and faster-growing company. He joined Olaplex in June 2021 and helped Olaplex go public.</p><p>One other thing I&#8217;d like to note is that Olaplex is a private equity-backed company. Advent International owns more than 75% of Olaplex. The lock-up period expires in March so this will likely force downward pressure on Olaplex&#8217;s share price as such a large block of shares will likely be offloaded onto the rest of the market. This will also provide more liquidity for larger investors to own some of Olaplex&#8217;s business.</p><h4><em><strong>Section 5 - Valuation and Financials</strong></em></h4><p>Olaplex trades for a premium multiple because of its historical revenue growth, margin profile, and business characteristics. I think that a premium multiple is warranted though.   </p><p><strong>Multiples based on consensus estimates:</strong></p><ul><li><p>NTM EV/Sales = 19.3x</p></li><li><p>NTM EV/EBITDA = 31.1x</p></li><li><p>NTM P/FCF = 33.1x</p></li></ul><p>Consensus estimates have Olaplex growing revenue to ~$1.45bn in revenue and ~800mm in EBIT in 2025. From 2021 through 2025, consensus has Olaplex growing revenue at a CAGR of 25.2% and EBIT at a CAGR of 23.8%. From 2019 through 2021, Olaplex grew revenue at a CAGR of 99.5% and EBIT at a CAGR of 85.0%. I think consensus estimates are underappreciating Olaplex&#8217;s future revenue growth. Advent International&#8217;s lockup should bring more liquidity and attention to Olaplex&#8217;s stock.</p><p>The market seems to believe that Olaplex&#8217;s revenue growth will fall off and drop from ~100% to around 25%. While yes, management did highlight 25% revenue growth, this guidance was likely conservative because it is Olaplex&#8217;s first handful of quarters as a public company.   </p><h4><em><strong>Section 6 - Risks</strong></em></h4><p>One of the major risks that I came across in my research was this quote from Olaplex&#8217;s prospectus:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Cosway Company Inc. manufactures products that accounted for more than 70% of our net sales in 2020 and we continue to rely upon Cosway to manufacture a majority of our current product offerings.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>I think this is a major risk to Olaplex and Olaplex should look to diversify its supplier relationship to not be dependent on one supplier. While investors do not know how much of Cosway Company&#8217;s revenue comes from Olaplex, this is not a good data point for Olaplex.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Next High Quality Canadian Company?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Aritzia is a high-quality company, led by a dedicated and smart management team that is incentivized alongside shareholders.]]></description><link>https://monthly10k.substack.com/p/aritzia</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://monthly10k.substack.com/p/aritzia</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Stratus Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 17:00:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/04df66e0-f727-4fb1-a99c-eb82ef4c33b5_3000x2000.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4><em><strong>Preface</strong></em></h4><p>My goal in 2022 is to become a better writer and investor.

What do peers trade at?</p><h4><em><strong>Section 6 - Risks</strong></em></h4><p>What are some of the risks with Aritzia?</p><div><hr></div><h4><em><strong>Section 1 - Investment Thesis</strong></em></h4><p>Aritzia has all the tenets of a quality company with a great management team. Aritzia has strong growth, a properly incentivized and aligned management team, the ability to pivot and make tough decisions, and a long runway of growth.</p><p><strong>Key Thesis Points:</strong></p><ul><li><p>A strong brand reputation that leads to pricing power</p></li><li><p>A proven and trustworthy management team</p></li><li><p>Long and diverse runway of growth opportunities</p></li></ul><p><strong>Key KPIs:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Store location growth</p></li><li><p>E-commerce growth</p></li><li><p>USA expansion</p></li></ul><h4><em><strong>Section 2 - Business Model</strong></em></h4><p>Aritzia is an omnichannel retailer, meaning it sells clothes both in-person and online. Aritzia had a small e-commerce segment before the coronavirus pandemic. Since March 2020, Aritzia&#8217;s management team has built out its e-commerce capabilities. I think the retail locations and online shopping option complements each part of the business. Aritzia focuses primarily on women&#8217;s clothing but recently acquired Reigning Champ which likely indicates their interest in selling men&#8217;s clothing sometime in the future.</p><p><strong>Retail Segment</strong></p><p>Aritzia&#8217;s retail segment focuses on high-end store locations that have the desired type of foot traffic and demographic. You won&#8217;t find Aritzia in small-town Iowa with a population of 1,000 people. Aritzia has stores in most major cities and even multiple stores if the city dynamics support multiple locations.</p><p> According to <a href="https://retail-insider.com/retail-insider/2016/04/aritzia-brand/">Retail-Insider</a>, Aritzia&#8217;s target customer base is &#8220;women aged 14 to 30.&#8221; More broadly, the core customer base is women who want to buy high-quality clothing and aren&#8217;t afraid to pay a premium for brand and for quality.</p><p>As other retailers struggle to keep their doors open, Aritzia continues to expand its store locations, get better deals on rent, and prove doubters wrong by putting up impressive results from its store locations. There are concerns around the number of locations that will support an Aritzia store, but I discuss more of that in the risks section below.</p><p><strong>E-Commerce Segment</strong></p><p>While retail locations have always been Aritzia&#8217;s main source of revenue, Aritzia&#8217;s management team quickly pivoted to growing its e-commerce capabilities when the pandemic first started. E-commerce revenues accounted for 37% of revenue in Q2 back in October, 42% of revenue in Q1, and was just 20% of revenue back in Q1 of 2020 (the quarter after the pandemic started).</p><p>Aritzia&#8217;s management team had already planned on building out more e-commerce capabilities but this process quickly sped up as the pandemic took place. One of the major benefits of its e-commerce segment is higher margins. Other companies like Lululemon, Nike, and Canada Goose have higher margins through their respective direct-to-consumer or e-commerce segments than traditional retail locations.</p><h4><em><strong>Section 3 - Sustainable Competitive Advantages</strong></em></h4><p>Aritzia&#8217;s strongest sustainable competitive advantage is its brand. </p><p>While fashion choices come and go, Aritzia sells timeless clothing that can be worn across fashion trends, different time periods, and settings. </p><p>Aritzia accomplishes this through neutral colors and through high-quality pieces that customers will use for multiple purchases.</p><p>Just like other retail companies such as Nike, Lululemon, Apple, and Starbucks have a strong brand that customers love and trust, Aritzia has a loyal customer base. Aritzia&#8217;s brand has been building since 1984 when the business was first founded. Aritzia&#8217;s brand will not be replicated overnight nor can enough VC funding replicate what Aritzia has built.</p><h4><em><strong>Section 4 - Management and Capital Allocation</strong></em></h4><p>Brian Hill and Jennifer Wong run Aritzia. </p><p>Brian is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Aritzia and runs the creative side of the business such as clothing choices and fashion trends. He comes from a family involved in retail and opened the first Aritzia boutique in 1984 and has grown the business to where it is today. Brian runs the creative side of the business with the help of many departments.</p><p>Jennifer Wong is the President and Chief Operating Officer of Aritzia. She joined Aritzia in 1987 originally as a style advisor. After spending years learning the business through various roles, she was promoted to COO in 2007. Jennifer runs the operations of Aritzia.</p><p>Both Brian and Jennifer have spent decades with the business and know the business better than anyone else. They&#8217;ve built this business from a regular retail store into a public company that&#8217;s worth more than $5bn. </p><p>Just this year, Aritzia acquired 75% of Reigning Champ for $63 million and is set to acquire the rest over the next few years. Reigning is expected to make $25 million in revenue and $5 million in adjusted EBITDA for the full 2021 calendar year. I like this acquisition by Aritzia&#8217;s management team. Acquiring a strong men&#8217;s clothing brand at ~12.6x EBITDA for a strong brand and opening the door to expand into men&#8217;s clothing is a smart decision and one that I am comfortable with as a shareholder. Aritzia likely paid a lower multiple considering the synergies by integrating Reigning Champ with its existing product line and e-commerce capabilities.</p><p>While most acquisitions do not go smoothly, this is Aritzia&#8217;s first acquisition in over 5 years. I trust that this was a worthwhile use of capital and it could show signs of Aritzia&#8217;s intentions to enter men&#8217;s fashion.</p><h4><em><strong>Section 5 - Valuation and Financials</strong></em></h4><p>Aritzia currently trades at a higher multiple than I would like for this business, but not terrible considering the runway of growth and the quality of this business.</p><p><strong>Multiples based on consensus estimates:</strong></p><ul><li><p>NTM EV/Sales = 4.38x</p></li><li><p>NTM EV/EBITDA = 18.67x</p></li><li><p>NTM EV/EBIT = 29.21x</p></li></ul><p>While these multiples might be considered high for a retail company, I believe that consensus is underappreciating Aritzia&#8217;s potential revenue growth and therefore make Aritzia more expensive than it actually trades for.</p><p><strong>Lululemon&#8217;s multiples based on consensus estimates:</strong></p><ul><li><p>NTM EV/Sales = 7.35x</p></li><li><p>NTM EV/EBITDA = 29.98x</p></li><li><p>NTM EV/EBIT = 33.80x</p></li></ul><p>These are 67.8%, 60.6%, and 15.7% higher multiples than what Aritzia trades for. While yes, Lululemon is a more mature and larger company, Aritzia has all the same qualities that Lululemon does such as a dedicated customer base, brand loyalty, and pricing power. Aritzia has a larger runway for growth through men&#8217;s clothing, swimwear, store expansion, and e-commerce.</p><h4><em><strong>Section 6 - Risks</strong></em></h4><p>The major risk for Aritzia is the number of store locations that support the branding and unit economics of the business. Management aims for A+ locations that have both the desired foot traffic as well as the right location suitable for an Aritzia store. You&#8217;re likely to find an Aritzia in cities such as New York City, Washington DC, Chicago, and in more wealthy suburbs.</p><p>Therefore I worry about the number of store locations that Aritzia might be able to open. While big cities mentioned above might support numerous stores, how many stores can a city fit before cannibalizing sales? If Aritzia were to expand into A- or even B+ locations, would this hurt Aritzia&#8217;s brand and bring down important metrics like sales/sqft.</p><p>Since I don&#8217;t follow fashion trends that closely, the other risk I worry about is Aritzia&#8217;s exposure to a certain fashion trend or fad. Aritzia might have inventory that goes stale when a fashion trend turns the other direction. I think Brian Hill has a good sense of what clothing items will work and I&#8217;m glad he&#8217;s at the helm running this business, but what happens when he decides to retire? Is there a replacement that has the right combination of the business and fashion sense to run this business successfully?</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Transitioning to Monthly Deep Dives]]></title><description><![CDATA[Starting in August, I will be transitioning to monthly deep dives.]]></description><link>https://monthly10k.substack.com/p/monthlydeepdives</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://monthly10k.substack.com/p/monthlydeepdives</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Stratus Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jul 2021 13:00:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0009a80b-7542-4f67-aa43-fdf4652d58f3_400x400.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Transitioning to Monthly Deep Dives</h3><p>Starting in August I will be transitioning to publishing one premium deep dive a month (and will change the name to &#8220;Monthly 10-K.&#8221; I&#8217;ve enjoyed the past six months of doing weekly shallow dives, but I know that deep research is something I will enjoy more.

First, ThredUp is a managed resale marketplace that operates a consignment model similar to <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/therealreal">TheRealReal</a>. In 2019, ThredUp made the decision to focus more on consignment revenue than product revenue. Consignment revenue comes with higher gross margins and ThredUp doesn&#8217;t face as much inventory risk since customers get paid only if the clothing sells. This explains why product revenue has been decreasing since 2018. Consignment revenue accounts for 80.3% of total revenue as of Q1 2021.</p><p>The second business offering is ThredUp&#8217;s Resale-as-a-Service (RaaS) which helps brands and retailers control the reselling of their products. Companies such as eBay, Walmart, Everlane, Gap, and Athleta all work with ThredUp. While this is a small part of the business today, only working with ~21 partners, I think this could be a large opportunity if execution is successful. I talk about this more below.</p><h3>Total Addressable Market</h3><p>Historically I don&#8217;t think resale has been a large market but I think there are some tailwinds driving more dollars into this industry. I think more people are shedding some clothes in their closet and only looking to keep what they wear. These are just my thoughts and I don&#8217;t have data on this. </p><p>I think people are also becoming more aware of how often products are made and then thrown away and just sit in landfills or dumps. People are becoming more mindful of the environment and they understand why not buy or sell used clothes instead of spending more money on new clothes and also this activity likely helps the environment.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F440ced9d-afd5-40ea-b1d7-4012bc41a610_540x414.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F440ced9d-afd5-40ea-b1d7-4012bc41a610_540x414.png" width="540" height="414" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/440ced9d-afd5-40ea-b1d7-4012bc41a610_540x414.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:414,&quot;width&quot;:540,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:92665,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F440ced9d-afd5-40ea-b1d7-4012bc41a610_540x414.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F440ced9d-afd5-40ea-b1d7-4012bc41a610_540x414.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F440ced9d-afd5-40ea-b1d7-4012bc41a610_540x414.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F440ced9d-afd5-40ea-b1d7-4012bc41a610_540x414.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The graph above is directly from ThredUp&#8217;s investor presentation so it will be biased. </p><h3>Competitive Advantages</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Marketplace</strong></p><p>There seems to be a lot of competition in some new online marketplaces whether it be social marketplaces like Poshmark or managed marketplaces like TheRealReal, Farfetch and a handful of others. Once again, if ThredUp can become the largest resale marketplace, it can likely keep competitors away.</p></li><li><p><strong>Barriers to Entry</strong></p><p>ThredUp&#8217;s infrastructure may be tough to replicate. In a nutshell, ThredUp sends empty bags to customers. These customers pick the clothes they want to sell and put these clothes in the bags and ship it back to ThredUp. ThredUp then sorts what clothing is good enough to be sold and what&#8217;s not.</p><p>From an initial glance, this seems like a hard business model to scale and is certainly not a business I&#8217;d want to start. This might give it an advantage over its peers. ThredUp does have 75%+ gross margins on its consignment revenue which shows this business has properly scaled and overcome some of the fixed costs embedded in its infrastructure.</p></li></ul><h3>Financials</h3><p>The image below is a quick screenshot of the important KPIs for ThredUp. One thing I&#8217;d like to note is that the line item, &#8220;Orders per active buyer&#8221; for both Q1 2020 and Q1 2021 are annualized. The formula is therefore:</p><p>(4 x Orders) / active buyers.</p><p>This shows how this line item is trending throughout the year.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a5d447f-ff08-43da-8e81-2726b0cb9c83_1512x1036.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a5d447f-ff08-43da-8e81-2726b0cb9c83_1512x1036.png" width="1456" height="998" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4a5d447f-ff08-43da-8e81-2726b0cb9c83_1512x1036.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:998,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:648826,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a5d447f-ff08-43da-8e81-2726b0cb9c83_1512x1036.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a5d447f-ff08-43da-8e81-2726b0cb9c83_1512x1036.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a5d447f-ff08-43da-8e81-2726b0cb9c83_1512x1036.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a5d447f-ff08-43da-8e81-2726b0cb9c83_1512x1036.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>A quick look above shows tremendous growth in consignment revenue. From a very shallow look people might be disappointed with total revenue growth, but consignment growth is rather strong both before and during the pandemic. </p><h3>What&#8217;s Interesting</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Resale-as-a-Service</strong></p><p>I think this is an interesting idea that&#8217;s kinda out there in terms of being accepted or not. For example, what if ThredUp was able to create a solution that enabled all merchants to have a resale process instead of buying a new product? Think of all the merchants on Shopify that sell a product that could be reused or be sold resale? Furniture, clothing, and other areas are likely good verticals for ThredUp to go after. RaaS basically gives brands and retailers the ability to own both new and used inventory.</p></li></ul><h3>Future Questions</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Resale market</strong></p><p>While I think the resale market is likely to grow over the next handful of years, I would like to see more unbiased data showing this to be the case. I think the current size of this market could also be larger than is currently reported because some of the buying and selling of clothes seems to be done through friendships, DMs, garage sales, or through other channels offline.</p></li><li><p><strong>Learning more about the supply chain process</strong></p><p>While I think the process of picking out and taking pictures of clothing is hard to replicate, I&#8217;d want to dive more into this process and exactly how tough it may be for competitors to copy this process. ThredUp was founded in 2019 which likely gives it some head start versus competitors but a head start can only be so much if billions of dollars are thrown at this problem. </p></li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>ThredUp is another interesting company. I&#8217;m interested to see how ThredUp does post-COVID and whether it&#8217;ll enjoy any permanent benefits from the pandemic.</p><div><hr></div><p>If you&#8217;ve enjoyed this edition of Weekly 10-K please consider&nbsp;<a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/subscribe">becoming a paid subscriber</a>, sharing it with friends and colleagues, and following me on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/StratusYoung">Twitter</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[#33 - Mercari]]></title><description><![CDATA[C2C used goods marketplace.]]></description><link>https://monthly10k.substack.com/p/mercari</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://monthly10k.substack.com/p/mercari</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Stratus Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 13:00:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ccefdd2d-db1f-44e8-9106-1e433ec658ad_400x400.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Mercari - (TYO: 4385)</h3><p>Mercari is a used goods marketplace with operations in Japan and the United States.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e6e1f42-b05b-4f4b-beca-6d03d99c0ed9_1200x628.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e6e1f42-b05b-4f4b-beca-6d03d99c0ed9_1200x628.jpeg" width="1200" height="628" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7e6e1f42-b05b-4f4b-beca-6d03d99c0ed9_1200x628.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:628,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:26070,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e6e1f42-b05b-4f4b-beca-6d03d99c0ed9_1200x628.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e6e1f42-b05b-4f4b-beca-6d03d99c0ed9_1200x628.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e6e1f42-b05b-4f4b-beca-6d03d99c0ed9_1200x628.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e6e1f42-b05b-4f4b-beca-6d03d99c0ed9_1200x628.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h3>If you want to become a paid subscriber sign up below!</h3><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://monthly10k.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://monthly10k.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><p><em>Please note that this article does not constitute investment advice in any form.

There&#8217;s two categories I&#8217;d put these competitors in. Either these companies are broad marketplaces focused on everything ranging from vehicles to fashion or are a marketplace focused on a specific niche such as clothing, fashion, jewelry, or luxury.</p><p>Listed below are some of the more broad marketplaces that I&#8217;ve come across. I&#8217;m sure there are many others.</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://offerup.com/">OfferUp</a> (acquired <a href="https://we.letgo.com/">Letgo</a>)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.craigslist.org/about/sites">Craigslist</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/marketplace">Facebook Marketplace</a></p></li></ul><p>There are other substitutes besides these online marketplaces. There are neighborhood garage sales, flea markets, or simply selling things on eBay (I guess eBay is the original C2C marketplace).</p><h3>Business Overview</h3><p><a href="https://www.mercari.com/">Mercari</a> is a C2C marketplace where consumers can buy and sell used goods. Mercari is akin to Facebook marketplace but the marketplace is Mercari&#8217;s main business whereas for Facebook, it&#8217;s not. Mercari has a handful of business lines, but the two major business lines are the C2C marketplace and Merpay. Merpay is a mobile payment service that can be used on Mercari or at more than 2 million stores nationwide. I think this is similar to other businesses that have a payments revenue line like Shop Pay, Apple Pay, etc.</p><p>Mercari&#8217;s two primary markets are Japan and the United States. Mercari might not be a familiar name because its listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Of course, if successful, Mercari will likely look to expand internationally into Europe or the rest of Asia, but there are likely even more regional competitors now and definitely by then.</p><p>Mercari&#8217;s business model is straightforward. Mercari takes a 10% fee from the buyer on top of the purchase price. If the buyer purchases something worth $100, Mercari will collect an additional $10 on top of the $100 purchase. Merpay seems to be a way to pay on the Mercari marketplace and through other vendors.</p><h3>Total Addressable Market</h3><p>I don&#8217;t think companies in this industry run the risk of running out of room to expand within the core business line of being a C2C marketplace. Where companies may feel pressure is running into other marketplaces that run specific verticals. For example, TheRealReal might expand into other areas of fashion and might compete more closely with other C2C fashion marketplaces like Poshmark or Depop.</p><p>Mercari runs this risk but it seems to be a greater risk. Mercari might struggle to make a dent in fashion (probably the largest resale market) if there are so many fashion focused C2C marketplaces. Therefore Mercari will always be competing with some marketplace that has a specific niche focus. If all of the large resale categories have a winning and scaled competitor, what right does Mercari have to win eyeballs on both the supply and demand side?</p><p>The definition and scope of Mercari&#8217;s total addressable market is the resale market which potentially has tens if not hundreds of billions of GMV across all categories. The risk isn&#8217;t runway, it&#8217;s execution.</p><h3>Competitive Advantages</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Marketplace</strong></p><p>If Mercari is able to become the dominant C2C marketplace for used goods, then it&#8217;ll have a strong sustainable competitive advantage because that&#8217;s where both supply and demand will accrue and Mercari can continue to monetize its business model.</p><p>The downside is that of course there are larger companies like eBay, Facebook, and Amazon that could become serious about competing with Mercari and other marketplaces. </p></li><li><p><strong>Brand / Trust</strong></p><p>There&#8217;s a lot of issues with trust surrounding these used goods marketplaces. I&#8217;ve used some of these websites before and there are some sketchy people who don&#8217;t seem to be super trustworthy. Mercari seems to have a strong emphasis on safety at least from reading its investor presentations and looking through its website.</p><p>I think if Mercari truly believes in trust and safety for both buyers and sellers, that it could be a differentiating factor relative to other competitors. If both buyers and sellers are most comfortable using Mercari, then that&#8217;s where buyers and sellers will meet which will lead to network effects and more emphasis on safety and security.</p><p>I&#8217;m thinking Mercari could be the &#8220;Zappos for used goods&#8221; meaning Zappos is the most trusted platform and therefore will win in this space.</p></li></ul><h3>Financials</h3><p>I decided not to break out a full financial picture for Mercari. Mercari doesn&#8217;t list out all of its important metrics like GMV, MAU, or other relevant financial figures in an easy to use template or chart.</p><p>If you want to get a sense of the growth of this business, check out this <a href="https://pdf.irpocket.com/C4385/M6bm/HJmM/WQbU.pdf">presentation</a> from Mercari&#8217;s Q3 2021 earnings call.</p><h3>What&#8217;s Interesting</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Attractive business model</strong></p><p>I think marketplaces are a great business model. These businesses often have the best and most sustainable competitive advantages. Can&#8217;t really go wrong investing in a basket of marketplace business models in my opinion.</p><p>I think Mercari might be a company to keep an eye on for the future to see if competition is not a threat and if Mercari can really prove out its value proposition and its winning position over current and future competitors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Overlooked international business?</strong></p><p>Mercari isn&#8217;t the most popular business on Twitter or in the news, but it&#8217;s also not unheard of. If Mercari were to be listed in the US it&#8217;d be a much more popular business I think.</p><p>Anyway, why is this interesting? Well I think if investors can find international companies with a proven business model, strong competitive advantages, and strong growth before others, then obviously they&#8217;ll do well assuming all those points are in place.</p></li></ul><h3>Future Questions</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Facebook marketplace?</strong></p><p>I don&#8217;t understand why or how Facebook marketplace doesn&#8217;t crush some of these competitors. If you&#8217;re a marketplace that just focuses on being a broad general marketplace, what&#8217;s your advantage over Facebook marketplace?</p><p>One reason I could see is that people want their social graph and them selling their possessions being separate. Similar to Facebook&#8217;s attempt at launching a dating product and competing with Match Group. Not sure though.</p><p>I do see more vertical focused marketplaces like TheRealReal being successful (not TheRealReal specifically) but that business model of being a vertical focused used goods marketplace being successful.</p><p>If you&#8217;re a bull on Mercari or other general C2C marketplaces, I&#8217;d love to hear the thesis on why Facebook doesn&#8217;t win this space.</p></li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>I think Mercari is a good business to continue to study. I&#8217;m more interested in learning and talking with others about why Mercari might win over Facebook marketplace or if Facebook marketplace completely crushes any competitors.</p><div><hr></div><p>If you&#8217;ve enjoyed this edition of Weekly 10-K please consider&nbsp;<a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/subscribe">becoming a paid subscriber</a>, sharing it with friends and colleagues, and following me on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/StratusYoung">Twitter</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[#32 - Poshmark]]></title><description><![CDATA[Social marketplace focused on apparel goods.]]></description><link>https://monthly10k.substack.com/p/poshmark</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://monthly10k.substack.com/p/poshmark</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Stratus Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2021 13:00:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f3c1f106-87ef-4e53-812d-cbee38d204d2_714x440.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Poshmark - (NASDAQ: POSH)</h3><p>Poshmark is a &#8220;social marketplace&#8221; focused on secondhand apparel goods.  </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd45bcbf5-da89-45ff-b6e9-c0f017b0e5d4_1500x850.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd45bcbf5-da89-45ff-b6e9-c0f017b0e5d4_1500x850.jpeg" width="1456" height="825" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d45bcbf5-da89-45ff-b6e9-c0f017b0e5d4_1500x850.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:825,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:42277,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd45bcbf5-da89-45ff-b6e9-c0f017b0e5d4_1500x850.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd45bcbf5-da89-45ff-b6e9-c0f017b0e5d4_1500x850.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd45bcbf5-da89-45ff-b6e9-c0f017b0e5d4_1500x850.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd45bcbf5-da89-45ff-b6e9-c0f017b0e5d4_1500x850.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h3>If you want to become a paid subscriber sign up below!</h3><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://monthly10k.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://monthly10k.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><p><em>Please note that this article does not constitute investment advice in any form.

There are two types of competitors for Poshmark. The closest and most formidable competitors are other secondhand apparel marketplaces (those mentioned above). The other set of competitors are other secondhand marketplaces that compete in other categories like furniture, home goods, or just compete broadly in the secondhand good industry (Facebook marketplace comes to mind here). </p><p>Poshmark or the second group of competitors may encroach on each other&#8217;s turf one day. Poshmark may look to expand to other verticals. </p><p>Of course, the broader secondhand good marketplace competes with other options such as used items on Amazon, eBay, and some retail stores too.</p><h3>Business Overview</h3><p>Poshmark is a &#8220;social marketplace&#8221; which combines shopping with other features like being able to like and comment on different items for sale. People probably use these features to either save an item to look at later or comment and ask questions about a specific item like &#8220;Is this jacket too thick for the fall?&#8221; or &#8220;Is the color closer to a white or a cream?&#8221;</p><p>While some of the other businesses mentioned above are also apparel marketplaces, Poshmark seems to have more of a focus on the social aspect. As opposed to buying from Poshmark, you are buying from a seller using Poshmark&#8217;s platform. Although other marketplaces have third-party sellers, the seller&#8217;s profile isn&#8217;t shown so up front and center.</p><p>The image below is directly from Poshmark&#8217;s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001825480/000119312521007531/d66583ds1a.htm#toc66583_1">S-1</a>:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb22f7f3-6ebc-4527-8af3-0e2f7c2a6490_605x334.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb22f7f3-6ebc-4527-8af3-0e2f7c2a6490_605x334.jpeg" width="605" height="334" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/db22f7f3-6ebc-4527-8af3-0e2f7c2a6490_605x334.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:334,&quot;width&quot;:605,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:99867,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb22f7f3-6ebc-4527-8af3-0e2f7c2a6490_605x334.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb22f7f3-6ebc-4527-8af3-0e2f7c2a6490_605x334.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb22f7f3-6ebc-4527-8af3-0e2f7c2a6490_605x334.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb22f7f3-6ebc-4527-8af3-0e2f7c2a6490_605x334.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>I think most of this is fluff and doesn&#8217;t really give me a differentiated perspective, but I thought it was worth including.</p><p>Poshmark takes a 20% cut (or $2.95 if goods are less than $15) of the final price from sellers.

Some of these industries are likely complimentary for the core Poshmark consumer though so that&#8217;s also a good sign.</p><h3>Competitive Advantages</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Largest marketplace?</strong></p><p>Poshmark is a marketplace and marketplaces do have strong competitive advantages if the business can successfully connect supply and demand in one place. There are other competitors so it&#8217;s not a done deal that Poshmark is the winner in this industry.</p></li><li><p><strong>Switching costs for sellers?</strong></p><p>While it&#8217;s easy for a buyer to be onboarded to Poshmark&#8217;s platform (I signed up in 3 seconds), I wonder how hard it is for sellers to be onboarded onto Poshmark&#8217;s platform, connect bank account information, and set up a seller profile?</p><p>The other benefit to these platforms is that sellers may have high switching costs between platforms. Sellers are likely discouraged from switching platforms because sellers develop a following because of the social aspect of this marketplace. Sellers who try to move platforms likely lose their followers and have to start all over again.</p><p>The other aspect that might lead to high switching costs is simply starting your reputation over again as a seller. Buyers want to trust sellers and starting with no reviews may be a hard pill to swallow if the competitor&#8217;s platform is only a little better.   </p></li></ul><h3>Financials</h3><p>Poshmark had perfect timing for its IPO and raised a bunch of money but got swept up in the growth outflow beginning earlier this year and also didn&#8217;t provide guidance for 2021 which took down the stock price even more.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27422409-fb27-42d4-a0e1-459c96b3d6f8_1016x946.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27422409-fb27-42d4-a0e1-459c96b3d6f8_1016x946.png" width="598" height="556.7992125984252" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/27422409-fb27-42d4-a0e1-459c96b3d6f8_1016x946.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:946,&quot;width&quot;:1016,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:598,&quot;bytes&quot;:413085,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27422409-fb27-42d4-a0e1-459c96b3d6f8_1016x946.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27422409-fb27-42d4-a0e1-459c96b3d6f8_1016x946.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27422409-fb27-42d4-a0e1-459c96b3d6f8_1016x946.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27422409-fb27-42d4-a0e1-459c96b3d6f8_1016x946.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>I wish the growth rate was a little bit higher, but this market is also quite large and I believe it could continue growing 15%+ for a number of years if Poshmark&#8217;s management team is able to successfully execute its strategy.</p><p>Net revenue / GMV takes into account returns and order cancellations which is why the take rate will likely stay below 20% unless Poshmark increases its fees. </p><h3>What&#8217;s Interesting</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Social marketplace</strong></p><p>I think the social marketplace and just social commerce in general will be a trend for the foreseeable future. I think this social commerce trend will benefit many companies and not just marketplaces. There will be companies built that are the &#8220;picks and shovels&#8221; for businesses that want to have more of a social graph with their buyers and sellers.</p><p>There are other businesses that are blending social graphs in with commerce and I think it leads to more trust between buyers and sellers and could also lead to higher switching costs as I mentioned above.</p></li><li><p><strong>Valuation?</strong></p><p>Quick napkin math here, but if you assume Poshmark does $332 million in revenue for 2021 (y/y growth of ~26.7%) at 80% gross margins (median gross profit margin past 3 years has been 83.4%), it is trading for 10x 2021 P/S or 12.5x 2021 P/gross profit.</p><p>While these numbers are just a quick estimate of valuation and I haven&#8217;t dug too much into the possibility of Poshmark achieving that revenue amount, even if Poshmark only hits $300 million in revenue, it still looks cheap relative to other online marketplaces with above average revenue growth.</p><p>Poshmark is done more than 55% from its 52 week high back in January. This might be an opportunity to dig into this business or industry and understand what the rest of the market may be missing. </p></li></ul><h3>Future Questions</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Expansion outside of apparel?</strong></p><p>Poshmark has already expanded out of its core apparel industry into other verticals like home and pets.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Women&#8217;s was our first category, followed by our launch of Men&#8217;s and Kid&#8217;s in 2016. Plus and Petite Sizes were added in 2018 and 2019, respectively. In 2019, we added the Home category, in 2020, we added the Beauty and Toys categories, and in 2021, we added the Pets category. We anticipate adding new categories to expand our product offering and continue to serve demand from our diverse community.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>While Poshmark continues to expand out from its initial category, it will likely run into more competitors and these competitors might be more established or have a better reputation in its respective vertical. What makes Poshmark win in other categories where other competitors have already been operating for a number of years and have built up more supply and demand on those platforms? What gives Poshmark the tipping point to take over other verticals?</p></li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>I think these secondhand marketplaces are an interesting business to study. I&#8217;ve bought some goods from Craigslist, Facebook marketplace, and other websites, but I still have some questions about the business model. I still think it&#8217;s pretty easy to go around the platform considering it&#8217;s focused on regular consumers instead of businesses.</p><div><hr></div><p>If you&#8217;ve enjoyed this edition of Weekly 10-K please consider&nbsp;<a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/subscribe">becoming a paid subscriber</a>, sharing it with friends and colleagues, and following me on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/StratusYoung">Twitter</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[#31 - Farfetch]]></title><description><![CDATA[Online luxury marketplace.]]></description><link>https://monthly10k.substack.com/p/farfetch</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://monthly10k.substack.com/p/farfetch</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Stratus Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2021 13:00:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8edd0f01-07fa-40cd-a4bd-bd75dd715316_180x180.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Farfetch - (NYSE: FTCH)</h3><p>Farfetch is an online luxury marketplace connecting brands with consumers.

First comes the brands that manufacture products, then comes either a retailer which the brands sell wholesale to, or the brands go direct to consumer (either through their own websites, retail stores, Farfetch, or other channels). Farfetch and luxury brands also compete with consumers or companies that sell used luxury products such as TheRealReal. To an extent, Farfetch likely also competes with other marketplaces (Amazon?) and retail stores (Neiman Marcus if it&#8217;s still around).</p><p>Farfetch has a valuable position as the marketplace connecting the supply and demand for the luxury industry. Farfetch has expanded from this primary business to offering more services for luxury brands such as fulfillment and an e-commerce solution. Shopify for luxury brands basically. </p><h3>Business Overview</h3><p>Farfetch is an online platform that helps luxury brands sell clothing and other items for consumers. Farfetch has a number of different business lines.</p><ul><li><p>Farfetch Marketplace</p></li><li><p>Farfetch Platform Solutions</p></li><li><p>Farfetch Store of the Future</p></li><li><p>Browns</p></li><li><p>Stadium Goods</p></li><li><p>New Guards</p></li></ul><p>Farfetch separates these businesses into three distinct segments, Digital Platform, Brand Platform, and In-Store. </p><p>Digital Platform includes the marketplace, platform solutions, Browns, Stadium Goods, store of the future, and any other online sales. Platform solutions is like a Shopify offering specifically for luxury companies. </p><p>Brand Platform is comprised of design, production, brand development and wholesale distribution of brands owned and licensed by New Guards and includes franchised store operations. In-Store includes stores that Farfetch operates. </p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F039e03cf-68de-4fb1-ac30-4d45ca9a0124_1858x596.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F039e03cf-68de-4fb1-ac30-4d45ca9a0124_1858x596.png" width="1456" height="467" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/039e03cf-68de-4fb1-ac30-4d45ca9a0124_1858x596.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:467,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:444706,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F039e03cf-68de-4fb1-ac30-4d45ca9a0124_1858x596.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F039e03cf-68de-4fb1-ac30-4d45ca9a0124_1858x596.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F039e03cf-68de-4fb1-ac30-4d45ca9a0124_1858x596.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F039e03cf-68de-4fb1-ac30-4d45ca9a0124_1858x596.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The image above gives a tremendous overview of Farfetch&#8217;s various lines of businesses and the take rates associated with the first-party marketplace model.</p><h3>Total Addressable Market</h3><p>The global luxury market is a massive market. China and the US are the two major markets for luxury products. China has seen tremendous growth over the past couple of years and this can help explain why JD, Alibaba, and Tencent have all been invested in Farfetch at one point or another.</p><p>Most estimates have the total addressable market above $400 billion and growing low single digits. The market for buying luxury products online is growing much faster, double digits. Farfetch processed ~$3.1 billion in gross merchandise value in 2020 and has been growing by a CAGR of ~51.9% even through a pandemic which bodes well for Farfetch. </p><h3>Competitive Advantages</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Largest luxury marketplace</strong></p><p>Farfetch seems to be the leading marketplace dedicated to finding luxury products across the world. Brands and consumers (supply and demand) are connected on this platform and Farfetch helps to arrange this as its position as the middleman.</p></li><li><p><strong>Brand and consumer trust</strong></p><p>With scale, continued execution, and years of building a brand as the go to luxury platform, Farfetch&#8217;s reputation is likely able to put the minds of brands and consumers at ease knowing that Farfetch is a trustworthy platform and has the interests of its stakeholders in mind.</p><p>Over time, consumers will trust Farfetch&#8217;s platform as the one and only luxury marketplace and will have comfort knowing that the items for sale are true luxury products.</p><p>Brands will likely continue to gain comfort over time as Farfetch becomes a more trusted partner to sell luxury goods. Brands likely don&#8217;t want to sell on Amazon, Target, Walmart, or other more normal websites and shops.</p></li></ul><h3>Financials</h3><p>Below is a snapshot of just the basic financial results for Farfetch. Obviously Farfetch is losing a ton of money but bulls would likely argue that Farfetch is trying to reach scale and be the winner in a winner take all market (marketplaces work that way).</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c559e55-40e9-43ce-a2e8-cc324faa2183_1134x1066.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c559e55-40e9-43ce-a2e8-cc324faa2183_1134x1066.png" width="1134" height="1066" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1c559e55-40e9-43ce-a2e8-cc324faa2183_1134x1066.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1066,&quot;width&quot;:1134,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:499457,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c559e55-40e9-43ce-a2e8-cc324faa2183_1134x1066.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c559e55-40e9-43ce-a2e8-cc324faa2183_1134x1066.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c559e55-40e9-43ce-a2e8-cc324faa2183_1134x1066.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c559e55-40e9-43ce-a2e8-cc324faa2183_1134x1066.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>One thing I&#8217;d caution is that the total revenue divided by GMV is a flawed and lazy assumption of Farfetch&#8217;s take rate. In the image above from an investor presentation, Farfetch&#8217;s actual take rate is under 30%.</p><h3>What&#8217;s Interesting</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Leading marketplace</strong></p><p>Marketplaces are one of the most attractive businesses. While Farfetch isn&#8217;t a pure-play marketplace, the majority of its business is the marketplace and there are always additional revenue sources for the leading marketplace.</p><p>I try to invest in companies that are the leading companies within its industry. Farfetch seems to be the winning company in this industry and has done phenomenal through the pandemic. I think this says a lot about the management team and their ability to execute during tough times.</p></li><li><p><strong>JD, Alibaba, and Tencent</strong></p><p>One of the more interesting headlines I&#8217;ve noticed since following Farfetch for a couple of months is that at one point in time, JD, Alibaba, and Tencent have all been invested in Farfetch.</p><p>Because China is such an important market for luxury demand, it makes sense that these three companies wanted to have a piece of the winning luxury marketplace as it expands into China and the rest of Asia.</p><p>Having the support and backing of these three companies will likely carry Farfetch throughout China and hopefully into the rest of Asia as it expands.</p></li></ul><h3>Future Questions</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Amazon, Etsy, and other marketplaces?</strong></p><p>What makes the luxury industry need its own marketplace? I haven&#8217;t studied Etsy too in depth, but one of the earlier bear cases was that Amazon would just take over Etsy&#8217;s niche and dominant it as the largest marketplace in the world. While Amazon can&#8217;t win everything, investors have to have an answer for why Amazon can&#8217;t move into this industry and crush its competitors. That&#8217;s my question for why the luxury industry will be independent of Amazon.</p><p>I believe that consumers shopping for luxury goods likely don&#8217;t want to buy a luxury purse and some toilet paper in purchase. That&#8217;s probably a lazy answer, but what about other larger marketplaces? Can that answer be applied for the marketplaces in China? </p></li><li><p><strong>Why do luxury brands work with Farfetch?</strong></p><p>Luxury brands already have a source of consumer demand because of their brand. Why do these companies need to and want to work with Farfetch to sell more luxury products? Does working with Farfetch help these luxury brands reach more consumers? Farfetch also takes a hefty take rate north of 25% so why are these brands so willing to work with a luxury marketplace?</p></li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>I think Farfetch is likely a great business. I know lots of retail investors seem to love it on Twitter and even other notable hedge funds have large positions in Farfetch and there have been so great write-ups on the company so far.</p><p>Farfetch has an attractive business model, is led by its founder, and operates in an industry with large tailwinds. While this isn&#8217;t a full deep dive on the company, I think it is one that should be noteworthy and warrant further investigation.</p><div><hr></div><p>If you&#8217;ve enjoyed this edition of Weekly 10-K please consider&nbsp;<a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/subscribe">becoming a paid subscriber</a>, sharing it with friends and colleagues, and following me on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/StratusYoung">Twitter</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[#30 - TheRealReal]]></title><description><![CDATA[Luxury consigned marketplace.]]></description><link>https://monthly10k.substack.com/p/therealreal</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://monthly10k.substack.com/p/therealreal</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Stratus Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jun 2021 13:00:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ac33ffd4-02e9-4fb6-bec5-a3349b32eee6_320x320.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The RealReal - (NASDAQ: REAL)</h3><p>The RealReal is a pre-owned luxury marketplace focused on working with sellers via a consignment model to sell luxury goods to buyers.

Competitors could be other luxury companies like Cartier, Chanel, other marketplaces like eBay, Farfetch, and Amazon, or other sources of luxury goods such as Craigslist, garage sales, or wherever else buyers find luxury products.</p><p>One of the major differentiators between The RealReal and other competitors is the focus on being a marketplace for consigned luxury inventory instead of being just a luxury marketplace (my understanding of Farfetch). Farfetch and The RealReal might encroach on each other&#8217;s turf in a few years which wouldn&#8217;t surprise me.  </p><h3>Business Overview</h3><p>The RealReal is an online marketplace for consigned luxury goods. The RealReal works with vendors and consigners to sell goods to buyers. The RealReal takes a cut of the transaction and recognizes it as revenue.</p><p>The RealReal buys used luxury clothing from consumers and sells it online through its marketplace or sells it through its retail stores. The RealReal acquires luxury goods through consigners at their homes, through virtual appointments, and direct shipping. The RealReal also uses its stores and vendors as another way to buy supply of luxury goods. Consigners achieved a commission rate of ~64% in 2020 and can earn up to 85% in commissions.</p><p>The RealReal has a couple of other revenue generating segments such as direct revenue which is when it takes ownership of inventory without paying commission fees to consigners. It also recognizes revenue from shipping fees and &#8220;First Look&#8221; which is a program where buyers get early access to items. </p><p>The RealReal operates retail stores which improve unit economics by acquiring higher value buyers and consigners, increasing lifetime value, increasing AOV, and lowering return rates. The RealReal has a number of these stores with locations in Los Angeles, San Francisco, SoHo and Upper East Side in NYC, and in Chicago.</p><h3>Total Addressable Market</h3><p>The global luxury market is of course another massive market. One <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201117005990/en/Global-Luxury-Goods-Market-Report-2020-Market-to-Reach-403.2-Billion-by-2027---ResearchAndMarkets.com">source</a> has estimated the global luxury market to be worth ~$400 billion by 2027. The US and China are estimated to be the largest markets for luxury products.</p><p>Another <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2020/secondhand-opportunity-hard-luxury">source</a> has estimated the second hand luxury market to be worth $25 billion. The RealReal processed ~$1 billion in GMV in 2020. Before the pandemic, The RealReal had strong revenue growth rates (seen below) and I wonder if these growth rates will pick up again post-COVID. </p><h3>Competitive Advantages</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Network effects</strong></p><p>Just like other marketplace business models, if The RealReal can connect supply and demand in a fragmented market with high transaction costs, then this will be a hard business to replicate. As more buyers and sellers come onto the platform, then The RealReal&#8217;s competitive position will strengthen.</p><p>There are other large luxury marketplaces (most notably Farfetch) which may turn out to be competitors but this industry is likely large enough to support a handful of winners with a winner take all business model.</p></li><li><p><strong>Branding / Authentication</strong></p><p>The RealReal authenticates consigned luxury goods. Buyers might not trust buying an expensive purse or watch from eBay or from other websites that do not authenticate its items. </p><blockquote><p>&#8220;We have highly trained gemologists, horologists, brand experts and art curators who collectively inspect thousands of items each day.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>The RealReal has invested in its operations to authenticate its luxury products. This might lead to a high barrier to entry for competitors. Not having trained staff on hand to authenticate items might turn away would be buyers from online luxury platforms. </p><p>The RealReal focuses a lot on the authentication of its goods and making sure that it stays true to its word of being a pre-owned luxury goods marketplace. </p><blockquote><p>&#8220;We build trust in our buyer base by thoroughly inspecting the quality and condition of every item and putting every item through our authentication process. This trust drives repeat purchases from our buyer base and instills confidence in first-time buyers to purchase pre-owned luxury goods.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;We believe we have the most rigorous authentication process in the marketplace.&#8221;</p></blockquote></li></ul><h3>Financials</h3><p>Decided it&#8217;s easier to just input a screenshot of the financials instead of just listing it via bullet points. I&#8217;ve gotten some questions about putting it into a chart and I think Substack is working on it but don&#8217;t know when it&#8217;ll come out. For now, enjoy.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc19fcdc4-4a47-4a72-8133-a19833fb6d44_985x759.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc19fcdc4-4a47-4a72-8133-a19833fb6d44_985x759.png" width="985" height="759" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c19fcdc4-4a47-4a72-8133-a19833fb6d44_985x759.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:759,&quot;width&quot;:985,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:125119,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc19fcdc4-4a47-4a72-8133-a19833fb6d44_985x759.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc19fcdc4-4a47-4a72-8133-a19833fb6d44_985x759.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc19fcdc4-4a47-4a72-8133-a19833fb6d44_985x759.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc19fcdc4-4a47-4a72-8133-a19833fb6d44_985x759.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>One of the impressive things that I wouldn&#8217;t have expected is the high growth rates up until 2020. Obviously the business was losing money but it was also trying to win market share and prevent competitors from becoming a huge threat. In a business with network effects, companies will invest in capturing market share until there are no real threats. </p><p>Some notes:</p><ul><li><p>NMV = net merchandise volume, which is the value of sales from consigned goods and our inventory net of platform-wide discounts less product returns and order cancellations</p></li><li><p>Take rate = net consignment sales / (net consignment sales + consignor commissions)</p></li></ul><h3>What&#8217;s Interesting</h3><ul><li><p><strong>High take-rate</strong></p><p>The RealReal is able to command a very high take-rate from its consigner. From 2017 through 2020, The RealReal has had an average take rate of ~35.3. I think this high take rate shows how many steps are involved in the process of buying pre-owned luxury goods, to authenticating them, and finally shipping them to buyers. The number and complexity of these steps shows that it has pricing power with its consigners because where else are the consigners going to sell their goods? Consigners can&#8217;t authenticate these goods with ease (you likely can but how much would this cost? Is it worth the hassle?).</p></li><li><p><strong>Strong revenue growth pre-pandemic</strong></p><p>The RealReal grew revenue ~52% between 2017 and 2019 and then declined by ~5% in 2020. Maybe The RealReal will continue to grow at high rates again post-pandemic? From before the market drop in February/March of 2020, The RealReal is up ~25% which isn&#8217;t too shocking considering it seems like every business is up 50%+ since then.</p></li></ul><h3>Future Questions</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Buying pre-owned luxury goods?</strong></p><p>While one of the sources I posted about shows that the market for pre-owned luxury goods is quite large, I&#8217;m not a huge luxury user nor am I the likely demographic for The RealReal.</p><p>I wonder if there is such a large difference in demand between buying new luxury goods and pre-owned luxury goods. Do people worry about buying second-hand luxury goods? Do they not care?</p></li><li><p><strong>Reopening beneficiary?</strong></p><p>Does The RealReal benefit from the economy reopening and people spending more money on luxury goods? It seems as though if it does benefit from the reopening, its stock price hasn&#8217;t moved accordingly. If The RealReal can return to high rates of revenue growth, the stock price might make a move. </p></li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>This is an interesting company. I thought it was more along the lines of just a regular online retail marketplace focused on used clothes or something. I like the luxury angle and think having to authenticate items leads to a high barrier to entry for competition. I think there are some risks such as the non-existent revenue growth through COVID meanwhile other luxury companies like Farfetch have been killing it through COVID.</p><div><hr></div><p>If you&#8217;ve enjoyed this edition of Weekly 10-K please considering&nbsp;<a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/subscribe">becoming a paid subscriber</a>, sharing it with friends and colleagues, and following me on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/StratusYoung">Twitter</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[#029 - Klarna]]></title><description><![CDATA[European BNPL competitor.]]></description><link>https://monthly10k.substack.com/p/klarna</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://monthly10k.substack.com/p/klarna</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Stratus Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jun 2021 13:00:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ec89b08-2fe7-4f71-ac1a-3fb458829557_500x500.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Klarna - Private</h3><p>Klarna is a European based BNPL competitor.

Much of my original thoughts on the BNPL industry can be found via my shallow dives on&nbsp;<a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/affirm">Affirm</a> and <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/afterpay">Afterpay</a>.</p><p>Klarna is the last BNPL company that I will be covering in this newsletter. There are a number of other companies, but these companies aren&#8217;t a true BNPL company and do much more than just BNPL. Researching Affirm, Afterpay, and now Klarna has given me a good starting point on this industry and hopefully it has also given you a good starting point. Of course, my research isn&#8217;t meant to be a full deep dive on companies, but more of an introduction and you can decide where to go from here.</p><p>One important point I want to note is that I believe this industry will eventually turn into an oligopoly with only a handful of competitors. This will likely make this an attractive industry to search for opportunities among the handful of scaled competitors. I believe there are high barriers to entry and these companies will have strong competitive advantages which will prevent this industry from becoming commoditized with little to no profit pool. </p><h3>Business Overview</h3><p>Klarna is a BNPL competitor based in Europe and headquartered in Sweden. Klarna was founded by Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Niklas Adalberth, and Victor Jacobsson in Stockholm back in&nbsp;2005. Affirm and Afterpay were founded in 2012 and 2014, respectively. This has given Klarna a head start on its competitors.</p><p>Klarna&#8217;s business model is more similar to Affirm than Afterpay. Klarna makes revenue three ways. Klarna receives a commission from merchants, receives late fees from consumers, or receives interest from customers. Afterpay doesn&#8217;t charge interest but also doesn&#8217;t finance more expensive purchases like a new Peloton bike. Affirm and Klarna allow consumers to finance larger purchases but these purchases come with interest payments.</p><p>Klarna has historically focused on Europe and has been expanding into other regions like the US, China, and other regions. So far Klarna has done a good job of expanding into the US and abroad. For example, I&#8217;ll list a number of screenshots below that help give a better description of Klarna&#8217;s expansion. The first screenshot represents Klarna&#8217;s global app installs in 2020 compared to 2019 and also compared to other competitors in 2020.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c03efad-68d8-49dc-b084-9642a71ebca0_500x336.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c03efad-68d8-49dc-b084-9642a71ebca0_500x336.png" width="500" height="336" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5c03efad-68d8-49dc-b084-9642a71ebca0_500x336.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:336,&quot;width&quot;:500,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:23365,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c03efad-68d8-49dc-b084-9642a71ebca0_500x336.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c03efad-68d8-49dc-b084-9642a71ebca0_500x336.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c03efad-68d8-49dc-b084-9642a71ebca0_500x336.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c03efad-68d8-49dc-b084-9642a71ebca0_500x336.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The next screenshot below represents Klarna&#8217;s US app installs in both 2019 and 2020 and compared to its closest competitor (likely <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/afterpay">Afterpay</a>?).

Klarna processed ~$53 billion in GMV in 2020. Afterpay processed ~$9.8 billion and Affirm processed ~$4.6 billion.

BNPL companies typically take up to 6% in commissions from merchants for helping merchants sell products and services. For simple math, we&#8217;ll say the total addressable market for US alone is worth ~$250 billion (5% of $5 trillion). While this number is split between cash, credit cards, debit cards, and now BNPL services, this is a massive market for Affirm, Klarna, and Afterpay.</p><p>There is room for expansion in international markets as well. The $5 trillion market is only US retail and does not include international opportunities like Europe, Asia, South America, or elsewhere. </p><p>There was a quote in <a href="https://www.klarna.com/assets/2021/03/30041759/Annual-Report-Klarna-Bank-AB-2020-210329.pdf">Klarna&#8217;s annual report</a> that I thought was interesting and spoke to the potential for Klarna and this market:</p><blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;Global retailers want global partners&#8221;</strong></p></blockquote><p>While there might be local winners such as Afterpay in Australia or Klarna in Europe, large retailers (like Nike, Lululemon, and others) want to work with 1 or 2 companies, not 100s. Of course, to play devil&#8217;s advocate, a consumer will be local not global. Consumers will use whatever the traditional BNPL offering is in a specific region.</p><h3>Competitive Advantages</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Scale</strong></p><p>One aspect of this industry that will lead to high barriers to entry is the amount of data needed to minimize credit losses while still having customers. By the time competitors might try and displace the top BNPL companies, Klarna, Affirm, and Afterpay will likely have years worth of data and consumer behavior to minimize risk and maximize profits. </p><p>Smaller competitors will likely stand no chance against these incumbents without millions of dollars to market to customers (not impossible with VC money) or a better product for both merchants and consumers. </p></li><li><p><strong>Small but powerful network effects</strong></p><p>I&#8217;ve touched on this before but will repeat again. Consumers will use BNPL solutions that are taken by the majority of retailers. Retailers want to work with BNPL companies that have a large user base. This creates a network effect. More consumers leads to more retailers. More retailers lead to more consumers. And the cycle repeats itself.</p><p>While the top competitors have built this network of merchants and consumers (and might be commoditized among the top competitors), smaller competitors and any future competitors will have to replicate this network effect in order to be competitive. That will likely be tricky to replicate because consumers and merchants don&#8217;t want to adopt another solution if it&#8217;s only marginally better than their current solution.  </p></li><li><p><strong>Switching costs</strong></p><p>As consumers&#8217; habits grow and become stable, these users won&#8217;t switch to other solutions for a 10% improvement. These BNPL companies want to do more than just finance purchases for consumers. Afterpay wants to be a quasi marketplace, Affirm wants to get into banking, and Klarna likely wants to get into banking, lending, become a quasi marketplace, a mix of all three, or more! </p><p>As these top companies grow and expand into other financial service offerings consumers are going to become more trapped in this ecosystem and competitors won&#8217;t be able to target these consumers.</p></li></ul><h3>Financials</h3><p>All figures below are in USD and are roughly accurate. I used average exchange rates provided in Klarna&#8217;s annual report. Klarna is still a private company, so there is only so much information provided in its annual reports. Klarna was recently in some headlines because it raised ~$639 million at a valuation north of $45 billion. </p><h4>2020</h4><ul><li><p>GMV = 53 billion</p></li><li><p>Net interest revenue = 289.5 million</p></li><li><p>Net commission revenue = 771.6 million</p></li><li><p>Total revenue = 1,087.0 million</p></li><li><p>Gross profit = 690.5 million</p></li><li><p><em>Total revenue as a % of GMV = 2.1%</em></p></li><li><p><em>GMV growth = 45.8%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Net interest revenue growth = 9.8%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Net commission revenue growth = 49.2% </em></p></li><li><p><em>Total revenue growth = 39.8%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Gross profit margin = 63.5%</em></p></li></ul><h4>2019</h4><ul><li><p>GMV = 35 billion</p></li><li><p>Net interest revenue = 255.4 million</p></li><li><p>Net commission revenue = 500.6 million</p></li><li><p>Total revenue = 753.1 million</p></li><li><p>Gross profit = 511.1 million</p></li><li><p><em>Total revenue as a % of GMV = 2.2%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Net interest revenue growth = 36.6%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Net commission revenue growth = 70.3%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Total revenue growth = 40.5%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Gross profit margin = 67.9%</em></p></li></ul><p>It&#8217;s quite impressive that Klarna had north of $1 billion in revenue and is growing total revenue by close to 40% y/y.  </p><h3>What&#8217;s Interesting</h3><ul><li><p><strong>BNPL = customer acquisition tool</strong></p><p>One interesting idea that I&#8217;ve been thinking about with this industry is that BNPL services seems like a pretty compelling customer acquisition tool especially if these companies are moving into higher value services like banking, lending, or building a marketplace.</p><p>While BNPL companies will likely have strong operating margins at maturity, there is also the ability to cheaply acquire customers and then offer them higher value services in order to grow profit and have even better margins.</p></li><li><p><strong>Largest competitor</strong></p><p>Klarna just dwarfs other competitors in this industry. As Klarna grows, it continues to benefit from scale. Klarna can build out more financial offerings, invest in more brand marketing, and continue to grow its network of consumers and merchants. One characteristic I also look for is investing in the winners of an industry and Klarna seems to be a winner based on its large GMV and quick success in the US. </p></li></ul><h3>Future Questions</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Paypal and other competitors?</strong></p><p>While this will be my last shallow dive on the companies in the BNPL space, there are still a handful of other companies that are competitors. Paypal is a big incumbent. Paypal is just a big company that can&#8217;t be written about within a week. While BNPL might not be Paypal&#8217;s biggest priority, Paypal can throw its weight around to crush smaller startups. </p><p>There are still a number of smaller competitors like Quadpay (acquired by Zip co) and Sezzle (traded as ASX:SZL). These competitors might make it into the top handful of competitors if this industry turns into an oligopoly. More research will likely tell you this answer.</p></li><li><p><strong>Optionality within Klarna?</strong></p><p>One aspect of companies that I like to invest in are whether or not there is any optionality within the businesses and whether that optionality is priced in. While Klarna is yet to be public, the size of the business will likely be north of $50 billion when it does go public. <a href="https://fintechmagazine.com/financial-services-finserv/klarna-raises-usdollar639m-dollar456bn-valuation">Klarna recently raised ~$639 million at a post-money valuation of $45.6 billion</a>. This makes it the second most valuable fintech startup in the world (only behind Stripe).</p><p>At the price of $45.6 billion, the chance of a 4x, 5x, or even 10x seems quite small, but this market is also quite large and Klarna has had great success thus far. The financial services industry is a big market with high customer lifetime value. If Klarna can expand into other services, the price might not be terrible.  </p></li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>I&#8217;ve enjoyed learning about this industry. I came into industry quite skeptical and wasn&#8217;t really sure how these were good companies or even would be good investments, but this is a good industry and I&#8217;m looking to learning more as these companies grow into the spotlight and become more ingrained in our society.</p><p>I&#8217;m mostly looking forward to Klarna going public, reading some more public filings, and seeing what revenue multiple they command. </p><div><hr></div><p>If you&#8217;ve enjoyed this edition of Weekly 10-K please considering becoming a <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/subscribe">paid subscriber</a>, sharing it with friends and colleagues, and following me on <a href="https://twitter.com/StratusYoung">Twitter</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[#028 - Afterpay]]></title><description><![CDATA[Australian based BNPL competitor.]]></description><link>https://monthly10k.substack.com/p/afterpay</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://monthly10k.substack.com/p/afterpay</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Stratus Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jun 2021 13:00:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1075b439-339f-462d-bc64-085f966a2f3b_866x650.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Afterpay - (ASX: APT)</h3><p>Afterpay is a leading BNPL provider based in Australia but rapidly expanding in the US and other international markets.

There is always the risk of losing parts or all of your money when you invest in securities or other financial products.</em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Industry Overview</strong></h3><p>Afterpay competes in the BNPL space with other competitors like <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/affirm">Affirm</a>, Klarna, Quadpay (<a href="https://www.quadpay.com/quadpay-zip-join-forces/">recently acquired by Zip</a>), and PayPal. Much of my original thoughts on the BNPL industry can be found via my shallow dive on <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/affirm">Affirm</a>.</p><h4>Why BNPL?</h4><p>BNPL gives consumers more flexibility to make purchases on their terms and not the terms of credit card companies. Critics of this industry are quick to say that &#8220;consumers don&#8217;t have the cash needed to complete these transactions&#8221; and therefore BNPL companies provide sources of funding to consumers who may not be able to repay this debt. Providing funding to consumers who cannot repay debt is not a good business model. Critics believe these companies have too much credit risk and therefore are not quality investments. </p><p>While this may be partially true as some percentage of the customer base will always be unable to pay back debt, I think the amount of consumers that aren&#8217;t able to repay or don&#8217;t have the sources of funds is likely lower than critics believe. Understanding the loss ratio is critical to understanding the credit risk of these companies. For example, Afterpay has loss rates less than 1% of GMV. These loss rates are declining over time as consumer frequency grows and &#8220;delinquent&#8221; customers are weeded out.</p><p>BNPL offerings allow consumers to space out payments. Just as businesses want to space out payments of liabilities, consumers want to do the same. If consumers can delay the full payment by a couple weeks or more than a month, consumers can budget better and potentially reinvest this cash elsewhere before paying back their purchase.</p><p>There are also numerous benefits to merchants. Merchants like offering BNPL products because it increases conversion rate, average order value (AoV), and reduces friction in the transaction process. Consumers are likely to make more and larger purchases if given a more flexible payment option. Therefore consumers will buy and spend more often.</p><h4><strong>Competition</strong></h4><p>There are numerous competitors in this industry as I&#8217;ve mentioned above. I think this industry will slim down to a handful of competitors. I believe there are network effects embedded with the BNPL business model so its all about capturing the largest number of merchants and customers today and creating a sticky platform so these users don&#8217;t switch to competitors. Merchants and customers will gravitate towards the BNPL companies with the largest and broadest scale.</p><h3>Business Overview</h3><p>Afterpay is an Australian based BNPL competitor, and is focused on Australia, New Zealand, US, Canada, and the UK (called Clearpay in the UK). Afterpay has a mature Australian market and is looking to expand in the US, Europe and Asia.</p><p>Afterpay&#8217;s business model is similar to the rest of the BNPL competitors. Afterpay allows customers to pay for a purchase and split it via 4 equal payments over 6 weeks (time of purchase, time of purchase + 2 weeks, time of purchase + 4 weeks, time of purchase + 6 weeks).</p><p>One primary difference between Afterpay and Affirm is that Afterpay never charges interest to consumers which is a major difference between Afterpay and Affirm.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Customers are never entrapped in revolving debt and never incur interest.&#8221; </p><p><em>- Afterpay&#8217;s 2021 Half Year Report</em></p></blockquote><p>Affirm charges interest depending on the purchase price as well as how many payments consumers need to pay for a purchase. While Affirm&#8217;s customers only accumulate simple interest (interest does not compound over time), I believe this is still a noteworthy difference because these BNPL companies are competing with credit cards. Credit card companies typically charge interest on both the principal balance as well as the interest balance. Instead of charging interest, Afterpay charges a late fee (which is fixed, capped, and does not accumulate over time). Customers who miss a payment can&#8217;t use Afterpay until payments are up-to-date.</p><p>Afterpay has three primary revenue sources, merchant fees (the majority of revenue), late fees (a small and decreasing portion of revenues), and a &#8220;Pay Now&#8221; business line which provides various services to other businesses such as compliance, fraud protection, and more. The &#8220;Pay Now&#8221; business is a small (1.9% of total sales and declining y/y) and unimportant revenue line so we&#8217;ll be focusing on merchant and late fee revenue.   </p><h3>Total Addressable Market</h3><p>The retail market is likely one of if not the largest market in the world. Affirm&#8217;s management team highlighted more than $5 trillion in global retail spending. While BNPL companies typically take between 3% and 6% of a transaction, this is still a massive opportunity for these companies. 5% of $5 trillion is still a massive market to go after. Even after accounting for other costs, the profit pool is likely in the tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars for this industry. While not all of this will accrue to the top competitor or even the top handful of competitors, investors can gain comfort knowing that there seems to be a long runway of growth for this industry.</p><h3>Competitive Advantages</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Scale + network effects</strong></p><p>Similar to Affirm and other competitors, the BNPL space is in the land grab phase where companies are trying to invest in marketing and sales to capture both merchants and consumers. As more customers adopt Afterpay, more merchants are likely to adopt Afterpay. As acceptance grows, more customers will adopt Afterpay and the cycle continues.</p><p>While I don&#8217;t think this will be a winner take all market, this industry will slim down to the top handful of competitors as merchants only want to work with the top handful of BNPL providers.</p><p>Only the top competitors will be able to branch out into other business lines such as banking, advertising, or other business lines accretive to a BNPL offering. </p></li><li><p><strong>Sticky and loyal customer base (both consumers and merchants)</strong></p><p>Consumers may start to develop habits that make Afterpay the preferred payment option at checkout (both online and offline). More consumers are also starting their shopping journey on Afterpay&#8217;s Shop Directory.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;And on average, we sent 27 million leads to our retail partners each month for the half or 45 million in the month of December.&#8221;</p><p><em>- Afterpay&#8217;s 2021 Half Year Report</em></p></blockquote><p>This is just another example of how Afterpay helps merchants. As customers become more accustomed to not only using Afterpay as the preferred payment option but also as the starting point for their shopping journey, these habits will become long lasting and create a sticky customer base.</p></li></ul><h3>Financials</h3><p>First, all financial figures below are represented in dollars. Second, I want to point out that the customer count is in millions whereas the merchant count is in thousands. Third, Afterpay Net Transaction Margin (NTM) is calculated by taking the gross profit and subtracting receivables impairment expense, NTM finance cost, and chargebacks &amp; debt recovery costs.</p><p>Afterpay has seen some tremendous growth, but so has the rest of the industry. There is still a long runway of growth left and Afterpay has demonstrated its ability to make a profit in its mature Australian market.</p><h4>H1 2021</h4><ul><li><p>Afterpay revenue = 374.2 million</p></li><li><p>Other revenue (late fees) = 35.1 million</p></li><li><p>Total revenue = 417.1 million</p></li><li><p>Gross profit = 306.8 million</p></li><li><p>Afterpay NTM = 213.9 million</p></li><li><p>GMV = 9.8 billion</p></li><li><p>Total merchants = 74.8 thousand </p></li><li><p>Total customers = 13.1 million</p></li><li><p><em>Afterpay revenue as a % of GMV = 3.8%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Afterpay revenue growth = 108.4%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Other revenue (late fees) growth = 7.7%</em></p></li><li><p><em>GMV growth = 106.3%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Merchant growth = 72.7%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Customer growth = 79.5%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Gross profit margin = 73.6%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Afterpay NTM margin = 51.3%</em></p></li></ul><h4>2020</h4><ul><li><p>Afterpay revenue = 433.8 million</p></li><li><p>Other revenue (late fees) = 68.8 million</p></li><li><p>Total revenue = 519.1 million</p></li><li><p>Gross profit = 384.8 million</p></li><li><p>Afterpay NTM = 250.2 million</p></li><li><p>GMV = 11.1 billion</p></li><li><p>Total merchants = 55.4 thousand </p></li><li><p>Total customers = 9.9 million</p></li><li><p><em>Afterpay revenue as a % of GMV = 3.9%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Afterpay revenue growth = 115.9%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Other revenue (late fees) growth = 49.2%</em></p></li><li><p><em>GMV growth = 111.8%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Merchant growth = 72.0%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Customer growth = 115.2%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Gross profit margin = 74.1%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Afterpay NTM margin = 48.2%</em></p></li></ul><h4>2019</h4><ul><li><p>Afterpay revenue = 200.9 million</p></li><li><p>Other revenue (late fees) = 46.1 million</p></li><li><p>Total revenue = 264.1 million</p></li><li><p>Gross profit = 204.5 million</p></li><li><p>Afterpay NTM = 119.3 million</p></li><li><p>GMV = 5.2 billion</p></li><li><p>Total merchants = 32.2 thousand  </p></li><li><p>Total customers = 4.6 million</p></li><li><p><em>Afterpay revenue growth = 127.5%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Other revenue (late fees) growth = 62.3%</em></p></li><li><p><em>GMV growth = 140.0%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Merchant growth = 101.3%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Customer growth = 130.0%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Gross profit margin = 77.4%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Afterpay NTM margin = 45.2%</em></p></li></ul><h4>What&#8217;s Interesting</h4><ul><li><p><strong>Demonstrated success and profitability</strong></p><p>Afterpay has demonstrated success and profitability of this business model in its Asia Pacific segment (a more mature market). Based off the 2021 half year report, Afterpay&#8217;s Asia Pacific segment had an adjusted EBITDA margin of ~54.3% and when accounting for corporate expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was more than 39%. Afterpay is likely reinvesting these profits to capture more international markets the US and other Asian countries. Similar to other winner take all or winner take most industries, Afterpay is investing now for the potential to be a major winner in this industry.</p></li><li><p><strong>Optionality</strong></p><p> From reading about Affirm and Afterpay, it seems as though these companies want to expand into other product offerings and become more ingrained in the financial lives of its consumer base and potentially merchant base as well.</p><p>There are likely numerous future business segments that Afterpay could build and offer that would be accretive to its main BNPL business segment. Afterpay and other BNPL competitors could collect revenue from all the leads its giving away free to merchants. It could build out an advertising revenue stream from its Shop Directory.</p><p>Other companies like Affirm are even looking to get into banking and become more integrated with the rest of consumer financial habits. Ultimately, it depends on the probability and magnitude of the success of these extra projects and what investors are paying (if paying at all) for this upside potential. </p></li></ul><h3>Future Questions</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Existing markets pays for future markets?</strong></p><p>Since Afterpay already has an existing market in Australia and this segment is profitable, can Afterpay reinvest these profits into nascent like the United States or other markets and therefore beat competitors by being the first to reach a sufficient enough scale? Not sure if I&#8217;m stretching here, but this feels similar to Sea Limited investing the profits from its gaming business to build out the marketplace and payments business lines and ultimately win those markets and beat competition.</p></li><li><p><strong>Offline expansion?</strong></p><p>While e-commerce has been a large tailwind for more than two decades now, the majority of retail spending still occurs offline.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Offline retail still does represent the vast majority of retail.&#8221;</p><p><em>- Afterpay&#8217;s 2021 Half Year Report</em></p></blockquote><p>One of key questions I have moving forward is whether or not Afterpay will be able to have success in expanding towards offline purchases. While Afterpay&#8217;s management team has had success in its more mature Australian market, do these habits continue in other markets?</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;And as we accelerate into the physical world, we hope to prove that the product can work both online and off-line, similar to what we have seen in the early days in the Australian region.&#8221;</p><p><em>- Afterpay&#8217;s 2021 Half Year Report</em></p></blockquote><p>If Afterpay becomes a habit for consumers when spending online, then it likely continues to be a habit when spending offline.</p></li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>I&#8217;ve enjoyed studying Afterpay and am interested in studying it more closely in the future. I got the feeling that Afterpay cared more about its customer base and making sure their customers were treated fairly than I did for Affirm. I think this is noteworthy because these companies are trying to build trust and attack the credit card industry. </p><div><hr></div><p>If you&#8217;ve enjoyed this edition of Weekly 10-K please considering <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/subscribe">becoming a paid subscriber</a>, sharing it with friends and colleagues, and following me on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/StratusYoung">Twitter</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Consider Supporting My Research!]]></title><description><![CDATA[Thanks for the support!]]></description><link>https://monthly10k.substack.com/p/consider-supporting-my-research</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://monthly10k.substack.com/p/consider-supporting-my-research</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Stratus Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jun 2021 13:00:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/77b5d98f-f81a-4719-9457-267b9b3462b2_400x400.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>TLDR</h3><p>I&#8217;m starting a paid subscription offering for subscribers who value my research and want to further support this project.

Over the past six months, this format has changed a little bit. I continue to write weekly, but I found a new format that works for me and my investing style. I originally started off researching different companies that no other investors knew of. I realized that since I had no background on the broader industry (and didn&#8217;t have time to learn a new industry each week) that I offered no value (to myself and my subscribers). If I didn&#8217;t understand the background of an industry and its competitors, how would I know whether or not the company I was researching was actually a good business? </p><p>This led to a small change. Instead of researching specific companies, I&#8217;ve switched to researching particular industries. Since then, I&#8217;ve researched a number of industries such as the used car retailing industry, different web development competitors, and currently companies in the growing BNPL space.</p><p>My goal isn&#8217;t to offer investment advice or pitch you on the next &#8220;hot stock.&#8221; I enjoy learning about new businesses and industries and I want to share my research with others. I hope my writing has a long shelf life and that I can look back and see how companies and industries have changed over time.</p><h3>Become a Paid Supporter</h3><p>Like I mentioned above, I enjoy sharing my research with others and getting feedback from other investors. Therefore, I don&#8217;t want to hide my writing behind a paywall. I&#8217;m keeping everything free and open, but allowing subscribers who enjoy my research to subscribe if they believe I offer more value than the cost of a subscription (<strong>$7</strong>).</p><p>An additional value of being a paid subscriber is that you can vote on the next industry I&#8217;ll be covering. I&#8217;ll list out a couple of industries (and also take suggestions through the use of &#8220;Other?&#8221;) such as project management software (Smartsheet, Asana, Monday.com), gaming, or other industries that people might be looking to learn about.</p><p>The cost of a paid subscription is $7 a month or $70 for a full year. While I&#8217;m hopeful that many of you will subscribe and be able to make a difference in my budget, I understand that many people may not be comfortable paying $7 a month for a weekly newsletter that doesn&#8217;t offer immediate stock tips or actionable investment ideas. I still hope that my research has a long shelf life (instead of focusing on quarterly earnings or the next hot stock whose price will grow 100% in two weeks) and might one day be valuable for an investment idea.</p><p>Therefore, if you have the ability, you like my writing, and want to support this project of mine, please consider subscribing.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://monthly10k.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://monthly10k.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[#027 - Affirm]]></title><description><![CDATA[Affirm helps reduce the friction in purchasing products.]]></description><link>https://monthly10k.substack.com/p/affirm</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://monthly10k.substack.com/p/affirm</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Stratus Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 31 May 2021 13:00:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F521f4fce-57c9-4588-b272-52a63b2233fe_840x469.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Affirm - (NASDAQ: AFRM)</h3><p>Affirm is one of the major BNPL companies and is led by Max Levchin (one of the co-founders of Paypal).

The name is self-explanatory, but BNPL helps consumers split up purchases over various periods of time. The most common length of time is 4 payments in six weeks (&#8220;Pay in 4&#8221;):</p><ul><li><p>At purchase</p></li><li><p>2 weeks after initial purchase </p></li><li><p>4 weeks after initial purchase</p></li><li><p>6 weeks after initial purchase</p></li></ul><h4><strong>Why BNPL?</strong></h4><p>Consumers don&#8217;t like opaque credit card fees and high rates of interest. Consumers want to be able to split up expensive purchases over a number of periods without accruing interest on their credit card. These BNPL competitors offer consumers a clear value proposition. Split up and delay payments, know exactly what you owe, and pay less fees because some costs are paid by merchants. Merchants like offering BNPL products because it increases conversion rate, average order value (AoV), and reduces friction in the transaction process.</p><p>Many of these BNPL competitors are taking on the credit card industry. They want to make the industry more transparent and improve how consumers see these types of companies.</p><h4><strong>Competitors</strong></h4><p>There are a number of competitors in this market. Affirm is the first company I&#8217;m doing a shallow dive on, but some other notable companies are <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/for-you/pay-in-4">Paypal</a>, <a href="https://www.klarna.com/">Klarna</a>, and <a href="https://www.afterpay.com">Afterpay</a>.</p><p>One of the main factors that Affirm&#8217;s management touts as being different from competitors is that Affirm offers more flexible payment plans. Affirm&#8217;s competitors mainly seem to offer &#8220;Pay in 4&#8221; which splits payments into four equal payments (highlighted above). While the majority of Affirm&#8217;s payment plans span from 3 through 12 months, Affirm&#8217;s plans range from 6 weeks to 48 months. Why does this matter? Well if you have an expensive purchase, you don&#8217;t want the full amount sitting on your credit card, accruing interest, and affecting your credit score, so you choose to use a BNPL provider and split up those payments over a certain period of time.  </p><h3>Business Overview</h3><p>Affirm is one of the major buy now, pay later (<strong>BNPL</strong>) companies, alongside Klarna and Afterpay. I addressed some of the key industry points above.</p><p>Affirm was founded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Levchin">Max Levchin</a> in 2012. Max Levchin was a co-founder of Paypal and is part of the &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal_Mafia">Paypal Mafia</a>.&#8221; From an initial glance, Max seems like an incredible founder and his background seems to be well-suited to lead Affirm moving forward and building out more fintech products.  </p><p>The graphic below gives a quick overview of an average transaction for Affirm and other parties: </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff1f1f51b-1719-4c57-92e4-914ebff216d8_1746x1194.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff1f1f51b-1719-4c57-92e4-914ebff216d8_1746x1194.png" width="650" height="444.64285714285717" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f1f1f51b-1719-4c57-92e4-914ebff216d8_1746x1194.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:996,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:650,&quot;bytes&quot;:1103280,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff1f1f51b-1719-4c57-92e4-914ebff216d8_1746x1194.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff1f1f51b-1719-4c57-92e4-914ebff216d8_1746x1194.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff1f1f51b-1719-4c57-92e4-914ebff216d8_1746x1194.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff1f1f51b-1719-4c57-92e4-914ebff216d8_1746x1194.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Affirm wants to build out a more robust offering for its consumers. Affirm initially started with a typical BNPL offering, but has expanded into offering a virtual card (like a credit card essentially), a marketplace personalized for your interests with your data where you can shop and find new products, and finally a savings account. Affirm might be using its BNPL product solely as a customer acquisition tool which will feed the other products and services built on top of that offering such as a savings account.</p><h3>Total Addressable Market</h3><p><strong>How large is this market?</strong></p><p>Affirm competes in the massive e-commerce market and is even looking to expand both globally and into the broader retail commerce market with its debit card. The size of the market isn&#8217;t a big concern for me. Just think of the size of the e-commerce industry + regular commerce both in the United States and abroad.  </p><p>Affirm pegs the total U.S. retail market at more than $5.0 trillion, Affirm&#8217;s take rate (merchant network revenue/GMV) is ~5.0%. 5% of $5 trillion is more than $250 billion. Then there&#8217;s also additional upside through other revenue lines like interest income or other products that Affirm currently offers or will offer in the future. All in all, the market size isn&#8217;t a concern, rather how much of this accrues to BNPL competitors and more specifically Affirm.</p><p><strong>How much can Affirm capture?</strong></p><p>The question isn&#8217;t how big this market opportunity is, but rather how much can Affirm capture. This is still a competitive market and not a winner take all market. This question depends on a couple of factors. First, how many consumers will use a BNPL product and how much will they spend with a BNPL product?</p><h3>Competitive Advantages</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Network effects?</strong></p><p>I think there might be a small network effect within this industry. For example, the more consumers that use Affirm, the more like merchants will take Affirm as the main BNPL offering. I don&#8217;t think this is a complete winner take all market, but I do think the top players in this industry will have competitive advantages over smaller competitors looking to disrupt the space. </p><p>If anything, I think this space will end up being quite similar to credit card payment rails (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, and Discover). There will likely be a handful of companies that provide the biggest value proposition to consumers and merchants. Right now, the four appear to be Klarna, Afterpay, Affirm, and Paypal.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sticky platform?</strong></p><p>Affirm is building products that go beyond the BNPL space. Most interesting to me is that Affirm has launched a quasi-marketplace and savings account. What if one day, consumers first place to look for deals is the website&#8217;s of these major BNPL businesses? As of Q3 2021, 30% of Affirm transactions were&nbsp;initiated on through Affirm&#8217;s mobile app and website channels. Affirm has also launched a savings account which is likely a sticky service for consumers.  </p></li></ul><h3>Financials</h3><p>Affirm has two major revenue lines, merchant network revenue and interest income. Merchant network revenue is the revenue collected from fees paid by merchants. Interest income is self-explanatory. Affirm pays a lot in transaction costs (which is to be expected) and is not GAAP profitable. Transaction costs include the following:</p><ul><li><p>loss on loan purchase commitment</p></li><li><p>provision for credit losses</p></li><li><p>funding costs</p></li><li><p>processing and servicing</p></li></ul><p>Roughly 43% of Affirm&#8217;s GMV is non-interest bearing and the rest is interest-bearing loans. </p><h4>Through Q3 2021</h4><ul><li><p>Merchant network revenue = $290,894</p></li><li><p>Interest income = $222,624</p></li><li><p>Total other revenue = $95,166</p></li><li><p>Total revenue = $608,684</p></li><li><p>Revenue less transaction costs = $283,893</p></li><li><p>GAAP EBIT = ($229,522)</p></li><li><p>GMV = $5,808,415</p></li><li><p>Active customers = 5,364</p></li><li><p>Transactions per active customer = 2.3</p></li><li><p><em>Merchant network revenue / GMV = 5.0%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Merchant network revenue growth = 69.6%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Interest income growth = 61.8%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Other revenue growth = 102.1%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Revenue less transactions / total revenue = 46.6%</em></p></li><li><p><em>GAAP EBIT margin = (37.7%)</em></p></li></ul><h4>2020</h4><ul><li><p>Merchant network revenue = $256,752</p></li><li><p>Interest income = $186,730</p></li><li><p>Total other revenue = $66,046</p></li><li><p>Total revenue = $509,528</p></li><li><p>Revenue less transaction costs = $160,862</p></li><li><p>GAAP EBIT = ($107,790)</p></li><li><p>GMV = $4,637,220</p></li><li><p>Active customers = 3,618</p></li><li><p>Transactions per active customer = 2.1</p></li><li><p><em>Merchant network revenue / GMV = 5.5%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Merchant network revenue growth = 94.0%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Interest income growth = 56.4%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Other revenue growth = 424.2%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Revenue less transactions / total revenue = 31.6%</em></p></li><li><p><em>GAAP EBIT margin = (21.2%)</em></p></li></ul><h4>2019</h4><ul><li><p>Merchant network revenue = $132,363</p></li><li><p>Interest income = $119,404</p></li><li><p>Total other revenue = $12,600</p></li><li><p>Total revenue = $264,367</p></li><li><p>Revenue less transaction costs = $54,395</p></li><li><p>GAAP EBIT = ($127,441)</p></li><li><p>GMV = $2,620,059</p></li><li><p>Active customers = 2,045</p></li><li><p>Transactions per active customer = 2.0</p></li><li><p><em>Merchant network revenue / GMV = 5.1%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Revenue less transactions / total revenue = 20.6% </em></p></li><li><p><em>GAAP EBIT margin = (48.2%)</em></p></li></ul><h3>What&#8217;s Interesting</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Shopify Partnership</strong></p><p>I think the exclusive partnership with Shopify and its merchants is fantastic for Affirm. Shopify has hundreds of thousands of merchants and being able to be the exclusive BNPL provider is a great sign for Affirm.</p><p>While some might argue that Affirm had to buy this partnership by offering Shopify equity in Affirm, I do think that Shopify also wants to pick the best company and won&#8217;t sacrifice quality for its merchants. While Affirm might collect lower margins from transactions with Shopify merchants, the overall profit pool is likely much higher being on Shopify. </p><p>Bezos has a great quote about profit margins and dollars:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Percentage margins don&#8217;t matter. What matters always is dollar margins: the actual dollar amount. Companies are valued not on their percentage margins, but on how many dollars they actually make, and a multiple of that.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>While Affirm&#8217;s margins might decrease as a result of this partnership with Shopify and its merchant base, the amount of profit dollars collected will likely be much higher which will give Affirm a higher potential profit pool and lead to more shareholder value (hopefully). </p></li><li><p><strong>Beyond BNPL</strong></p><p>Affirm wants to do much more than just offer consumers and merchants a BNPL product. Affirm (alongside the rest of the fintech industry) wants to be the primary destination for consumers to shop, save, and process other financial transactions. If Affirm can continue to expand its financial products and build an increasingly sticky platform for consumers and merchants, then Affirm&#8217;s competitive advantage looks a lot more attractive to me.</p><p>One of the caveats to this is that there are a lot of fintech companies that want to be the primary home for your financial transactions (saving, spending, investing, etc.). This is likely a competitive and saturated strategy, but the rewards might be worth it.</p></li></ul><h3>Future Questions</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Stronger competitive advantages</strong></p><p>I like my companies to have a strong sustainable and growing competitive advantage either currently or in the near-term. I don&#8217;t see what Affirm&#8217;s sustainable competitive advantage is currently or how strong this competitive advantage truly is. I think the Shopify partnership is a major advantage, but there are also merchants off the Shopify platform which Affirm still needs to win. I&#8217;ll likely learn more about some of the major differentiations between Affirm, Afterpay, and Klarna as I do more research on this space, but I don&#8217;t see any major green flags that make Affirm stand out for me.</p></li><li><p><strong>Competition from incumbents</strong></p><p>There&#8217;s lots of talk about incumbent companies in this space. Besides competition with Klarna and Afterpay, Affirm also faces risks from Paypal, traditional banks and credit card companies.</p><p>I think the biggest risk is both other BNPL competitors and Paypal. Paypal has a massive distribution with consumers and merchants and easily make BNPL a feature rather than a whole other company. Other BNPL competitors are also a concern.</p><p>The downside for incumbents is that they&#8217;d be cannibalizing their own business if they offer a BNPL product. Many of the incumbents&#8217; business models revolve around collecting interest, charging late fees, and other fees that BNPL companies do not charge. BNPL companies are likely more aligned with consumers because these costs are subsidized by merchant fees.</p></li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>I think the BNPL space is rather interesting, I&#8217;m looking forward to learning more. I still have some questions about the industry and some of the competitive factors, but I like what I&#8217;m reading from my initial research.</p><div><hr></div><p>If you&#8217;ve enjoyed this edition of Weekly 10-K please considering subscribing, sharing it with friends and colleagues, and following me on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/StratusYoung">Twitter</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[#026 - Squarespace]]></title><description><![CDATA[Squarespace helps people and businesses make websites.]]></description><link>https://monthly10k.substack.com/p/squarespace</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://monthly10k.substack.com/p/squarespace</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Stratus Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 17 May 2021 13:00:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f7c23c95-7d11-4cb5-a69c-602f15941690_242x209.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Squarespace - (NASDAQ: SQSP)</h3><p>Squarespace helps people and businesses make a professional looking website without having to rely on a digital agency or designers.

These tasks include building a website, buying a domain name, and setting up a professional email. Many of the companies competing in this industry all offer similar if not identical services. My goal is to try and find out what are the primary differentiating factors that aren&#8217;t easily replicable by competitors and whether this leads to a sustainable competitive advantage. </p><p>Squarespace&#8217;s most notable competitors are Wix, Wordpress, and Weebly (owned by Square), and other competitors like GoDaddy, Shopify, Webflow, and others.</p><p>Nowadays having a website or an online presence is crucial to having success as a business and potentially even as an employee (showcasing your portfolio, resume, or a background about who you are). The internet is the first place people turn to find new restaurants, find a nearby company, or find out more information. Having a website is a fundamental need for all companies.</p><p>Squarespace makes it easy to build a website, but also offers the flexibility to build a more professional looking website. Many other competitors have a similar offering, making it easy to build an initial simple website while also giving you the flexibility to hire a designer to build a more professional website. Everyone needs a website, but there are so many businesses that help you create a website, so why would a company in this industry be a good investment?</p><h3>Business Overview</h3><p>Squarespace is a company that helps anyone make a website or an online presence as the company likes to call it. Squarespace has three primary business lines: </p><ul><li><p>Presence </p></li><li><p>Commerce </p></li><li><p>Marketing</p></li></ul><p>Squarespace only breaks out presence and commerce in its operating results. Presence is Squarespace&#8217;s traditional business line. Presence allows consumers to build a website, buy a domain, and build a social media following. Commerce enables consumers to sell physical products, subscriptions, content, and services online. Marketing gives customers marketing features like email campaigns, CRM functionality, SEO, and analytics tools.</p><p>Squarespace is led by its founder and CEO, Anthony Casalena, who founded this business in college and has grown it since. Anthony owns a huge stake in Squarespace and is likely well aligned with the future shareholder base.</p><p>Squarespace&#8217;s future potential probably lies within its commerce offering which has seen tremendous growth. Through commerce, Squarespace can also capture more revenue through subscription revenue but also collecting a take rate on the GMV processed through its platform.</p><h3>Total Addressable Market</h3><p>Squarespace competes in a large market. This is readily apparent with all the competitors in this industry like <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/shopify">Shopify</a>, <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/wix">Wix</a>, <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/godaddy">GoDaddy</a>, Wordpress, Webflow, and many others. There are even more companies that I haven&#8217;t heard of that help consumers and businesses make a website.</p><p>I think the concern for this industry is how much market share these companies can capture. There is plenty of room for these companies to grow. For example, the following is a quote from Squarespace&#8217;s S-1:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;We believe we have a significant existing and growing market opportunity with over 800&nbsp;million small businesses and self-employed ventures globally.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>At the end of 2020, Squarespace had ~3.6 million unique subscriptions (its term for subscribers) which shows a penetration rate of 0.45%. I don&#8217;t think Squarespace (or any competitor for that matter) to capture a large market share in this industry, but it does show that there is plenty of room for reinvesting into this business.</p><h3>Competitive Advantages</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Switching costs</strong></p><p>If you&#8217;re using Squarespace or any of its competitors for a personal site or for a business website, chances are you&#8217;d be very hesitant to switch sites and redo the whole process of building a website and learning the tools from another website creator. If you&#8217;re a business owner, you want to focus on running your business, not fixing your website. </p><p>To play devil&#8217;s advocate, business owners may be willing to pay a designer or someone else to redesign your website (do-it-for-me or &#8220;DIFM&#8221;) if the website is important for your business. What that leads me to believe is that what matters is what platform designers are most comfortable with. Designers face a learning curve with these platforms. They want to stick with the one or two tools they&#8217;re most comfortable and confident using. </p><p>If these designers are more comfortable working with Squarespace, then they&#8217;d try to convince clients to switch to Squarespace. That leads me to the question, what platform has the most skilled designers?</p></li><li><p><strong>Platform/Designer Marketplace</strong></p><p>Oftentimes these companies have a &#8220;marketplace&#8221; for various apps or services. Wix has an app market and a marketplace to connect designers, marketers, and web developers with website owners. Shopify has something similar via &#8220;Shopify App Store&#8221; and other competitors have very similar features to help consumers create their website. While I think this is an important feature, I worry that now that all of these companies offer a similar feature, that this isn&#8217;t a differentiating factor.</p></li></ul><h3>Financials</h3><p>Squarespace only recently filed its S-1 and is not a publicly traded company. The company doesn&#8217;t disclose much financial info, but I wrote what I thought was some of the important metrics below. Squarespace has some strong growth in the commerce segment of its business (more than 77% growth in 2020, albeit on a relatively small base compared to the rest of the business and in a transformational year for online spending). </p><p>ARPUS = average total revenue per unique subscription. Management calculates this figure by taking the total revenue dividing it by the average number of subscriptions over the past two years. Management&#8217;s forecast for 2021 are to do $764 - $776 million in revenue with a unlevered cash flow of $100 - $115 million. </p><h4>2020</h4><ul><li><p>Presence revenue = 477,831</p></li><li><p>Commerce revenue = 143,318</p></li><li><p>Total gross profit = 522,812</p></li><li><p>Unique subscriptions = 3,656</p></li><li><p>ARPUS = 170</p></li><li><p>GMV = 3,897,241</p></li><li><p><em>Gross profit margin = 84.2%</em></p></li><li><p><em>GAAP EBIT margin = 6.5%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Adjusted EBITDA margin = 18.8%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Unlevered free cash flow margin = 24.5%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Presence revenue growth = 18.2%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Commerce revenue growth = 77.8%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Commerce revenue / GMV = 3.7%</em></p></li></ul><h4>2019</h4><ul><li><p>Presence revenue = 404,156</p></li><li><p>Commerce revenue = 80,595</p></li><li><p>Total gross profit = 402,841</p></li><li><p>Unique subscriptions = 2,984</p></li><li><p>ARPUS = 162</p></li><li><p>GMV = 2,043,195</p></li><li><p><em>Gross profit margin = 83.1%</em></p></li><li><p><em>GAAP EBIT margin = 12.7%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Adjusted EBITDA margin = 20.1%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Unlevered free cash flow margin = 19.5%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Commerce revenue / GMV = 3.9%</em></p></li></ul><h3>What&#8217;s Interesting</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Founder-led</strong></p><p>I love a founder-led business. Anthony Casalena founded this business from his college dorm and has built it into a multibillion dollar business. Just like plenty of other successful companies (Facebook, Amazon, Shopify, and many others) having a founder at the helm of the company allows many investors to sleep well at night, myself included. He&#8217;s only 38 and will likely continue to run this business for a number of years.</p><p>While I still like to see a company with a strong sustainable competitive advantage, from this initial overview, I think the management team is less of a worry than other aspects of this business.</p></li><li><p><strong>Commerce</strong></p><p>While I doubt that Squarespace will be able to compete with Shopify for physical products, maybe Squarespace can have more success with digital products and services. There are plenty of other digital products and services that people pay for, such as being part of a community, building a membership or content paywall website, building a paid newsletter, or buying an online course. Squarespace may aim to serve as the backbone and necessary infrastructure for this type of commerce.</p></li></ul><h3>Future Questions</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Competition?</strong></p><p>I still am trying to figure out if there is really anything that sets companies in this industry apart from one another. I think the designer learning curve could be a potential competitive advantage, but then again I&#8217;m not sure how truly sustainable that competitive advantage will be.</p><p>I&#8217;m also bullish on Shopify and I don&#8217;t see how Squarespace or any of its competitors will be able to compete with Shopify. I don&#8217;t see how competitors will be able to compete with Shopify considering the level of investment and the brand recognition that Shopify already has among entrepreneurs and small business owners especially after the transformational year of 2020. I doubt that Squarespace or any other company will have much success in competing head on with Shopify for a number of reasons. Shopify went head-to-head with Amazon and won.</p></li><li><p><strong>What do website designers prefer?</strong> </p><p>If the competitive advantage among these companies truly stems from where website designers prefer to work, I should probably figure out the answer to that question. Squarespace needs to appeal to consumers but likely needs to appeal to designers even more than consumers since these designers will likely influence where the website is ultimately built. </p></li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>I always say whatever company I&#8217;m writing about is a good company. Describing a company as &#8220;good&#8221; probably means I&#8217;m neutral on the business. So I think Squarespace is a good business, but nothing that really blows me away and makes me want to invest within 15 minutes of reading about the company. That&#8217;s my filter for whenever I think a company is truly special. If the opportunity becomes obvious to me within 15 minutes, then I get pretty excited.</p><div><hr></div><p>If you&#8217;ve enjoyed this edition of Weekly 10-K please considering subscribing below, sharing it with friends and colleagues, or following me on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/StratusYoung">Twitter</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[#025 - Cazoo]]></title><description><![CDATA[Upcoming European online used car retailer.]]></description><link>https://monthly10k.substack.com/p/cazoo</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://monthly10k.substack.com/p/cazoo</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Stratus Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 10 May 2021 13:00:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdab37ba6-6352-4e2d-99fc-f70d89d140d7_672x448.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Cazoo - (NYSE: CZOO)</h3><p>Cazoo is an online used car retailer that operates primarily in the UK and is looking to expand to the rest of Europe.

I&#8217;ve covered the main ones (<a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/carvana">Carvana</a>, <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/vroom">Vroom</a>, <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/carmax">CarMax</a>, <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/shifttechnologies">Shift</a>, <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/carlotz">CarLotz</a>, <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/auto1group">Auto1 Group</a>, and now Cazoo). I&#8217;ve thought about writing an overall summary of the industry and what I&#8217;ve learned over the past number of weeks. This would be premium content so you&#8217;d have to pay for it sadly (I&#8217;ve got to make a profit somehow). If there&#8217;s enough interest, I&#8217;ll consider doing this so please let me know if you&#8217;d be interested in this.</p><p>Next week, I&#8217;ll cover Squarespace since I&#8217;ve covered <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/wix">Wix</a>, <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/godaddy">GoDaddy</a>, <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/bigcommerce">BigCommerce</a>, and <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/shopify">Shopify</a> already. After that, I&#8217;m open to suggestions on different industries to cover. I&#8217;m interested in looking at the BNPL space (Affirm, Klarna, Afterpay) but also have some other ideas. If there&#8217;s anything you&#8217;d want to hear/read about please let me know!</p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Industry Overview</strong></h3><p>I&#8217;ve been profiling the online used car market for a number of weeks now. I think this industry is interesting, but I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s very attractive at current prices. I think just like the rest of the market there might be pockets of opportunity, but I don&#8217;t know where they are today.</p><p>Cazoo competes with other online used car retailers such as Auto1 Group&#8217;s <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/auto1group">Autohero</a>, which is looking to expand and grow from being more than a wholesale platform for buyers and sellers. Cazoo also competes with traditional physical used car retailers.</p><p>I think the shift from buying cars in person and negotiating with a salesman is changing and more people will be comfortable buying a car online and having the opportunity to test out the car for a number of days or weeks before deciding on a purchase. Buying a car online reduces friction and with the environment of the past year, I think people are comfortable doing many more things remote and sight unseen. </p><h3>Business Overview</h3><p>Cazoo is a European online used retailer that is <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210328005028/en/Cazoo-to-Become-Listed-on-NYSE-through-7.0-Billion-Business-Combination-with-AJAX-I">going public through a SPAC with AJAX 1</a>. Cazoo has established itself in the UK and is looking to expand across the rest of Europe. Cazoo expects to use the proceeds from this transaction to accomplish this goal of basically being the &#8220;Carvana of Europe.&#8221;</p><p>Cazoo is another vertically integrated online used car retailer with in-house logistics and reconditioning. Cazoo has delivered more than 20,000 cars to consumers since its founding in 2018.</p><p>Like I&#8217;ve touched on before, I think having a vertically integrated process is important fort these online used car retailers. I think the infrastructure needed to succeed in this business is quite high. The density of reconditioning centers and logistics infrastructure helps to improve the economics of these businesses. Having higher infrastructure density leads to better turns of inventory, which reduces depreciation and lowers working capital commitments, and cheaper logistics costs. This strategy might differ between less dense and more dense areas of the world. For American competitors like <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/carvana">Carvana</a>, <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/shifttechnologies">Shift</a>, <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/vroom">Vroom</a>, <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/carlotz">CarLotz</a>, and <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/carmax">CarMax</a>, these companies need to invest in their infrastructure to build out a fixed cost business that will hopefully turn into operating leverage one day.</p><p>This seems to be the same story for Cazoo. I think the story just depends on how likely it is that Cazoo can achieve its goals with competition (mainly Auto1 Group) existing and looking to compete in this space combined with a fair valuation.</p><p>Since Cazoo isn&#8217;t even publicly trading yet, it&#8217;s hard to find more materials discussing earnings on strategy for example.</p><h3>Total Addressable Market</h3><p>Europe&#8217;s used car industry is also a massive industry just like the United States. I touched on this last week in <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/auto1group">Auto1 Group&#8217;s shallow dive</a>, but the used car industry in most countries is likely to be massive given how prevalent cars are in most parts of the world. The European used car market is valued at more than &#8364;600 billion. This is in line with the American used car market. One additional factor that likely brings up the total addressable market size is financing, which is estimated to bring in an additional &#8364;100 billion.</p><h3>Competitive Advantages</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Scale</strong></p><p>Like I alluded to above, I think scale is the best source of competitive advantage for many of these companies. Scale leads to economies of scale which leads to less costs and higher profits. If Cazoo or other competitors can build out a larger scale before any competitors can replicate it, then this might lead to a sustainable competitive advantage.</p><p>On the flip side, if traditional used car retailers already have this scale in place yet are losing ground to online competitors than maybe scale doesn&#8217;t lead to a competitive advantage. I think as an answer to this question I&#8217;d say that traditional used car retailers still have lots of friction in their business model and I want to say it&#8217;d be nearly impossible for these companies to basically reinvent themselves in order to reduce friction for customers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Brand</strong></p><p>I&#8217;ve also been saying that branding is important. Over your lifetime, the average consumer will probably buy a number of cars. If you&#8217;ve had a good experience with a certain retailer or you&#8217;ve heard your friends have had good experiences with a certain online retailer, then you&#8217;re likely to visit that website instead of others. You&#8217;ll know you&#8217;re likely to have a good experience and not have to start from scratch and find out what companies offer the best combination of prices, selection, and convenience for you.</p></li></ul><h3>Management</h3><p>There aren&#8217;t many available (or trustworthy) financials for this business, so instead of doing a financials overview, I&#8217;m going to do a management overview. If this is something you&#8217;d like to see in the future, let me know!</p><p>The main connection between the four executives profiled below is that 3/4 worked at Zoopla in very senior roles. Zoopla had a great exit and maybe Cazoo can do the same? </p><h4>Alex Chesterman</h4><p>Alex Chesterman founded Cazoo in 2018. His goal was to make buying a car just as easy and seamless as buying any other product online. Alex previously founded Zoopla (Zillow of UK?) in 2007, took it public in 2014, and sold it to Silver Lake in 2018 for &#8364;2.2 billion.</p><p>Alex also co-founded LoveFilm (DVD-by-mail, basically early day Netflix for the UK) in 2002. LoveFilm was eventually bought by Amazon for ~$200 million. Alex seems to be a very experienced executive and founder. He has some great experiences in the tech industry and I wonder what his motivation is for founding and running Cazoo (a much different business than before). Alex is likely already quite wealthy and doesn&#8217;t need to start, manage, and grow another business to have financial freedom.</p><h4><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-morana-53439bb/">Stephen Morana</a></h4><p>Stephen is the Chief Financial Officer at Cazoo. Stephen previously worked at Zoopla Property Group (the company founded by Chesterman. Stephen has worked in various roles before this position, such as CFO of <a href="https://www.zoopla.co.uk/">Zoopla</a>, various venture capital investing positions, CFO of <a href="https://www.betfair.com/">Betfair</a>, and other positions.</p><h4><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanhowell/">Jonathan Howell</a></h4><p>Jonathan is the Chief Technology Officer at Cazoo. Jonathan previously worked at <a href="https://www.made.com/">MADE.com</a>, a furniture retail company. Jonathan has been working at Cazoo since June 2019.</p><h4>Paul Whitehead</h4><p>Paul is the Chief Operating Officer at Cazoo. Paul has been working at Cazoo since December 2018 and previously worked as the Chief Strategy Officer at <a href="https://www.zoopla.co.uk/">Zoopla</a>. </p><h3>What&#8217;s Interesting</h3><ul><li><p><strong>&#8220;Carvana of Europe&#8221;</strong></p><p>The idea of being the &#8220;Carvana of Europe&#8221; without some of the concerns of Carvana is quite attractive. I worry that there are already more formidable competitors such as Auto1 Group, but I think there is likely an opportunity for this industry to support a number of companies. This is a massive fragmented market with a massive potential for many of these transactions to occur online as more people look to reduce the friction of buying a used car in-person and negotiating with a salesperson.</p><p>I think this idea is interesting enough. Carvana is a large business (whether or not you are concerned about some of the risks is a different story. There are other large online used car retailers and if Cazoo can be the winner in the European market, then this could likely be a big business. </p></li></ul><h3>Future Questions</h3><ul><li><p><strong>More about the business</strong></p><p>I&#8217;m looking forward to learning more about the business once the stock is trading and the management team has a couple of earnings call. I&#8217;m just curious about what are some of the similarities and differences with the rest of the American competitors. There&#8217;s just not enough information for me to make an informed decision where I can sleep peacefully at night knowing I own part of this business.</p></li><li><p><strong>Does density of infrastructure matter as much in Europe?</strong></p><p>I&#8217;m curious how important infrastructure or the density of infrastructure really is in Europe since cities are closer, population density is higher, and people use public transportation more often. Maybe having a handful of massive reconditioning centers instead of more reconditioning centers spread out is a better use of capital. What if the density of infrastructure isn&#8217;t as important as American peers, then the competitive advantage from scale isn&#8217;t truly sustainable since competitors can buildout the same infrastructure, make less costly mistakes, and all of a sudden are competing with Cazoo?      </p></li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>I think Cazoo is an interesting company and there&#8217;s likely potential for it to be a successful company. I&#8217;d like to see more information and think about the company though before investing in this business. I&#8217;m pretty selective about my holdings so I doubt this business will make it into my portfolio.</p><div><hr></div><p>If you&#8217;ve enjoyed this edition of Weekly 10-K please considering subscribing below, sharing it with friends and colleagues, or following me on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/StratusYoung">Twitter</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[#024 - Auto1 Group]]></title><description><![CDATA[Leading European online used car retailer.]]></description><link>https://monthly10k.substack.com/p/auto1group</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://monthly10k.substack.com/p/auto1group</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Stratus Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 03 May 2021 13:00:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d5eb4fc-84a5-4c03-8451-86e8863b1b5a_400x400.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Auto1 Group - (ETR: AG1)</h3><p>Auto1 Group is a leading European online used car retailer.

While there are some differences between the United States and European markets, I think the core idea that people will always buy and sell used cars is true.</p><p>It&#8217;s also unlikely that an American competitor would be able to compete in Europe. The same factors that give Carvana and CarMax an advantage in the United States are the reasons these companies can&#8217;t and likely won&#8217;t compete in Europe. Sure, CarMax, Carvana, and others might try to expand into Canada or Mexico, but moving across the Atlantic Ocean is an unlikely endeavor. Entering Europe would require extensive infrastructure and a large supply of cars which would be expensive and likely not worth it for those companies currently. </p><p>While there are other European online used car retailers, Auto1 Group seems to be the leading company. It does have competition which I will likely cover in the future. The most notable competitor is Cazoo which will list in the US via a SPAC. </p><h3>Business Overview</h3><p>Auto1 Group is a European online used car retailer. The companies I&#8217;ve previously written about all operate primarily in the United States. Auto1 Group seems to be the leading online used car retailer in Europe. </p><p>Auto1 Group has two distinct business lines, &#8220;AUTO1&#8221; which is Europe&#8217;s largest wholesale platform for used cars. More recently, Auto1 Group has launched &#8220;Autohero&#8221; which is a retail brand for regular consumers to buy used cars. The image below gives a small depiction of Auto1 Group&#8217;s business model.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8f4088c-7c1b-42a3-9e41-086698869d74_2076x658.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8f4088c-7c1b-42a3-9e41-086698869d74_2076x658.png" width="1456" height="461" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d8f4088c-7c1b-42a3-9e41-086698869d74_2076x658.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:461,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:511540,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8f4088c-7c1b-42a3-9e41-086698869d74_2076x658.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8f4088c-7c1b-42a3-9e41-086698869d74_2076x658.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8f4088c-7c1b-42a3-9e41-086698869d74_2076x658.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8f4088c-7c1b-42a3-9e41-086698869d74_2076x658.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Auto1 Group is able to choose whether or not a car should be sold wholesale or through retail. While most competitors have this option, Auto1 Group benefits even more because of the number of cars it sells through its wholesale platform. For example, in 2020 Auto1 Group sold more than 1.8x the number of cars via its wholesale platform than Carvana&#8217;s total retail unit sales in 2020. The image below is just a rough comparison of units sold between <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/carvana">Carvana</a> and Auto1 Group.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08d206f2-ef71-445f-8838-fc2ebf222ad3_1168x488.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08d206f2-ef71-445f-8838-fc2ebf222ad3_1168x488.png" width="1168" height="488" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/08d206f2-ef71-445f-8838-fc2ebf222ad3_1168x488.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:488,&quot;width&quot;:1168,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:198409,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08d206f2-ef71-445f-8838-fc2ebf222ad3_1168x488.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08d206f2-ef71-445f-8838-fc2ebf222ad3_1168x488.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08d206f2-ef71-445f-8838-fc2ebf222ad3_1168x488.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08d206f2-ef71-445f-8838-fc2ebf222ad3_1168x488.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The other interesting part of Auto1 Group&#8217;s wholesale platform is that it had a gross profit margin of more than 10.0% in 2020, whereas Carvana&#8217;s used vehicle gross profit margin was 7.6%! If Auto1 Group has better profit margins than Carvana&#8217;s used retail car business, does that mean Auto1 Group will have a higher profit margin on its retail business line in a number of years? While the wholesale business likely does not involve the same number of costs as selling a vehicle through a retail sales channel, it is impressive that Auto1 Group has consistently high gross margins on the wholesale business. </p><p>How does Auto1 Group make a better profit margin on selling wholesale cars than Carvana makes on selling its own inventory of cars? </p><p>Most American competitors don&#8217;t have a positive profit margin for the wholesale side of the business. From reading about other companies, most competitors use the wholesale side of the business to control inventory and be able to offload vehicles for a chance of making a small profit. Wholesale for other companies is a cost center, not a profit center. This is a key question that I will likely focus on through the rest of this shallow dive.</p><p>Auto1 Group also intends to invest in its Autohero platform which is relatively new and only sold 6,000 cars in 2019 and 10,000 cars in 2020 through the COVID-19 pandemic. This business is relatively immaterial for Auto1 Group today, but the potential is there. I think the potential for Auto1 Group is having both a leadership position as the main wholesale vehicle platform for Europe and being the main online used car retailer of Europe. Auto1 Group might have a better chance of being the leading online used car retailer for a specific geography than Carvana or any of its peers.</p><h3>Total Addressable Market</h3><p>Europe&#8217;s used car industry is also a massive industry just like the United States. Most estimates have the European used car market valued at more than &#8364;600 billion. This is in line with the American used car market. This isn&#8217;t a surprise to me and seems to make sense. There are also additional factors such as used car financing that bring this industry size up even more.</p><p>Auto1 Group boasts a total addressable market of more than &#8364;700 billion when including the financing associated with buying a used vehicle. I think the used car market is massive no matter what country or region you&#8217;re looking at. Cars are a necessity in many parts of the world.</p><h3>Competitive Advantages</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Scale</strong></p><p>I&#8217;ve been including this in seemingly every shallow dive I&#8217;ve done in this industry, but I do think it&#8217;s likely the most important. I think scale affords companies the ability to offer more competitive prices to consumers, reach more consumers, and have better profit margins. Having scale includes having the ability to deliver vehicles to consumers, to pick up vehicles from dealers or consumers, being able to source the best inventory, and many other important factors. Scale also allows companies to potentially have pricing power over suppliers and other stakeholders in an industry value chain.</p><p>Auto1 Group seems to be the leading online used car retailer operating in Europe.  </p></li><li><p><strong>Brand</strong></p><p>I&#8217;ve touched on this in a number of the shallow dives I&#8217;ve completed on various competitors, but I think consumers want a trustworthy and recognizable brand when buying a used car. Used cars are an expensive and important purchase for consumers. If Auto1 Group is the leading destination to both buy and sell a car, it seems as though it likely has advantages over incumbents and other peers.</p><p>I don&#8217;t think brand alone would give Auto1 Group a competitive advantage, but I do think that it&#8217;s an important factor that would be hard to overcome when Auto1 Group likely also benefits from scale. Hard to be known by all consumers when you don&#8217;t have the scale necessary to serve all countries or all parts of a continent. </p></li></ul><h3>Financials</h3><p>All of the following figures are in millions and euros (unless otherwise stated).</p><h4>2020</h4><p><strong>Merchant business line (Auto1)</strong></p><ul><li><p>C2B revenue = 2,349</p></li><li><p>Remarketing revenue = 348</p></li><li><p>Gross profit = 283</p></li><li><p>Cars sold through C2B (in thousands) = 397</p></li><li><p>Cars sold through remarketing (in thousands) = 50</p></li><li><p>Gross profit per unit = 633</p></li><li><p><em>C2B revenue growth = -24.4%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Remarketing revenue growth = 20.7%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Gross profit margin = 10.5%</em></p></li></ul><p><strong>Retail business line (Autohero)</strong></p><ul><li><p>Retail revenue = 133</p></li><li><p>Gross profit = 3</p></li><li><p>Cars sold (in thousands) = 10</p></li><li><p>Gross profit per unit = 285</p></li><li><p><em>Revenue growth = 62.9%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Gross profit margin = 2.2%</em></p></li></ul><h4>2019</h4><p><strong>Merchant business line (Auto1)</strong></p><ul><li><p>C2B revenue = 3,106</p></li><li><p>Remarketing revenue = 289</p></li><li><p>Gross profit = 341</p></li><li><p>Cars sold through C2B (in thousands) = 571</p></li><li><p>Cars sold through remarketing (in thousands) = 39</p></li><li><p>Gross profit per unit = 559</p></li><li><p><em>C2B revenue growth = 17.0%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Remarketing revenue growth = 73.5%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Gross profit margin = 10.0%</em></p></li></ul><p><strong>Retail business line (Autohero)</strong></p><ul><li><p>Retail revenue = 81</p></li><li><p>Gross profit = 1</p></li><li><p>Cars sold (in thousands) = 6</p></li><li><p>Gross profit per unit = 254</p></li><li><p><em>Revenue growth = 154.4%</em></p></li><li><p>Gross profit margin = 1.8%</p></li></ul><h4>2018</h4><p><strong>Merchant business line (Auto1)</strong></p><ul><li><p>C2B revenue = 2,654</p></li><li><p>Remarketing revenue = 166</p></li><li><p>Gross profit = 242</p></li><li><p>Cars sold through C2B (in thousands) = 515</p></li><li><p>Cars sold through remarketing (in thousands) = 20</p></li><li><p>Gross profit per unit = 452</p></li><li><p><em>C2B revenue growth = 28.0%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Remarketing revenue growth = 66.4%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Gross profit margin = 8.6%</em></p></li></ul><p><strong>Retail business line (Autohero)</strong></p><ul><li><p>Retail revenue = 32</p></li><li><p>Gross profit = 0</p></li><li><p>Cars sold (in thousands) = 3</p></li><li><p>Gross profit per unit = 0</p></li><li><p><em>Revenue growth = 788.9%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Gross profit margin = 0.0%</em></p></li></ul><p>Don&#8217;t be fooled by the high growth in the retail business for Auto1 Group. This is a tiny base of revenue and high growth rates should be expected. I&#8217;m also not concerned with the low gross margins from the retail business as Auto1 Group scales and is able to have better economies of scale as this business progresses.</p><h3>What&#8217;s Interesting</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Wholesale platform before retail platform?</strong></p><p>I&#8217;m most curious about Auto1 Group&#8217;s core business which is the wholesale platform for buying and selling used cars. Why did Auto1 Group start off with this strategy? What does this mean for its business and its ability to build out a core retail business for consumers? Does this wholesale business give Auto1 Group an advantage in choosing which cars should be sold retail to consumers?</p></li><li><p><strong>Growing retail platform</strong></p><p>This is where Auto1 Group&#8217;s future potential and growth probably lies. While only 10,000 cars were sold through its retail business line (Autohero), there is likely an obvious path to selling more than 100,000 cars in potentially a number of years? I think looking to more mature American competitors with a scaled retail platform is an easy comparison and also likely the best comparison. Carvana sold more than 244,000 retail units in 2020. I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s quite likely that Auto1 Group can reach even a quarter of these units in a number of years. </p></li></ul><h3>Future Questions</h3><ul><li><p><strong>What are the major differences between US and European used car retailers?</strong></p><p>There&#8217;s obviously going to be some major differences between the way people use cars based on just broad societal differences between Europe and the US. There are likely some differences on the total number of cars per person in the US and in Europe. This might just be a minor question or concern, but this is something I&#8217;d want to double check. </p></li><li><p><strong>Auto1 Group offer financing solutions?</strong></p><p>Auto1 Group works with 3rd party companies to offer consumers financing options. Other similar companies like Carvana and CarMax use in-house financing (with some slight differences) to offer consumers financing options. I&#8217;m surprised with Auto1 Group&#8217;s current size it doesn&#8217;t offer in-house financing for consumers and continues to rely on 3rd parties, especially when considering the profitability of this opportunity (but there are also risks associated with this).</p></li><li><p><strong>Wholesale business?</strong></p><p>What&#8217;s up with the massive wholesale business? No competitors or peers even come close to having a wholesale business the size of Auto1 Group. Auto1 Group is also able to make a consistent positive gross profit margin. While this might just be a result of scale, it&#8217;s still impressive that Auto1 Group has been able to do this consistently and no other company has. I would want to learn more about this piece of the business. It sounds as though Auto1 Group controls the value chain from the minute it picks up the car from a dealer (remarketing) or from a consumer (C2B) and sells it to a dealer. Therefore Auto1 Group doesn&#8217;t have to worry about paying auction fees or other middlemen that would take away from a low profit pool.</p></li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>I think Auto1 Group is a really interesting business and I wish it got more coverage from investors. I think there&#8217;s a lot to learn from this business that could possibly be applied to its US peers. I think if you&#8217;re bullish on this space but don&#8217;t like Carvana (for obvious reasons) and you don&#8217;t like any other American companies, Auto1 Group might be a fine option for you.</p><p>You should always do your own work.

There are older existing companies such as CarMax trying to capture more market share and newer companies such as Carvana, Vroom, and Shift that are trying to out perform the &#8220;legacy&#8221; competitors.</p><p>If you want to get a more complete picture of the used car industry, feel free to read through my shallow dives on&nbsp;<a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/carvana">Carvana</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/vroom">Vroom</a>. These companies buy cars from wholesale auctions, from consumers, or through other sources and try to fix these cars up and sell them to consumers.</p><h3>Business Overview</h3><p>CarLotz is an interesting business. I&#8217;ve enjoyed researching it this past week. It has a slightly different business models than some of its competitors like <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/carvana">Carvana</a>, <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/vroom">Vroom</a>, <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/carmax">CarMax</a>, and <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/shifttechnologies">Shift</a>. CarLotz combined with Acamar Partners Acquisition Corp to go public through a SPAC. CarLotz officially started trading under LOTZ in January 2021.</p><p>Like I said, CarLotz is a little different of a beast than its competitors. CarLotz has the typical business model of selling cars to consumers, but the buying process is unique. CarLotz utilizes a consignment model for the majority of its inventory. CarLotz works with corporate souring partners for ~60%+ of its inventory. These are companies like OEMs, banks, or other large corporate businesses that want to sell used cars to consumers. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69ef7783-87bb-427d-9fd8-5990acf51d99_1270x1038.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69ef7783-87bb-427d-9fd8-5990acf51d99_1270x1038.png" width="1270" height="1038" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/69ef7783-87bb-427d-9fd8-5990acf51d99_1270x1038.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1038,&quot;width&quot;:1270,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:515515,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69ef7783-87bb-427d-9fd8-5990acf51d99_1270x1038.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69ef7783-87bb-427d-9fd8-5990acf51d99_1270x1038.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69ef7783-87bb-427d-9fd8-5990acf51d99_1270x1038.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69ef7783-87bb-427d-9fd8-5990acf51d99_1270x1038.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Typically these customers could sell vehicles either through an auction process to consumers (basically retail sales) or through wholesale. CarLotz adds value by being able to offer better prices because it removes some of the inefficiencies in the supply chain. All stakeholders win when these corporate partners sell to (or cosign inventory to) CarLotz. Sourcing partners get a better price. Consumers get cheaper vehicles. CarLotz collects some revenue. </p><p>Here is an example of this process from the management team:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;This is a vehicle that would sell at an auction for $19,700, so net of fees. The auction would cut a check to the seller of this vehicle for $19,370. This is a vehicle we sold for $23,000. So net of our fee, which is about $1,000. And in this case, reconditioning, transport, gas to the tune of $952. Next, our client, $21,048. So $21,048 less what they would have gotten an auction, $19,370, gives them a lift on this vehicle of $1,728.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>The most interesting part of this business was the ability to have an asset-light source of inventory. CarLotz is able to avoid inventory problems and other risks associated with holding inventory that other competitors might face. </p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Competitors that own their own inventory, typically have hundreds of millions, in some cases, billions of dollars of inventory on hand, which is at risk. If there's a pandemic or something else that slows down sales, that's inventory which is getting devalued and that's inventory you own. So very risky.&#8221;</p><p><strong>&#8212; Michael Bor (Co-founder and CEO at Carlotz)</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-bor/">LinkedIn</a></p><p>CarLotz Presents at ICR Conference 2021, January 2021</p></blockquote><p>CarLotz also relies on other typical inventory channels such as from trade-ins, straight sales from consumers, or through buying at auctions. CarLotz does take on some inventory risk when some consumers don&#8217;t want to sell via CarLotz&#8217;s consignment business model. </p><p>The rest of CarLotz business, selling business to consumers and selling through wholesale, is the same as other competitors. </p><p>CarLotz has four strategies to expand and grow.</p><ol><li><p><strong>New hubs each quarter. </strong>Management is projecting an increase of 3-4 hubs per quarter. </p></li><li><p><strong>Sell-through. </strong>CarLotz wants to increase its sell-through rate (being able to turn inventory quicker).</p></li><li><p><strong>Increase average selling price.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Increase F&amp;I penetration. </strong>Other companies have strong F&amp;I income and CarLotz likely sees this as an avenue of high gross margin revenue (effectively 100%).</p></li></ol><p>CarLotz utilizes its own reconditioning centers and doesn&#8217;t rely on working with 3rd parties. CarLotz also works to ship vehicles to consumers and uses its own logistics for  trips within 50 miles and outsources this process with trips over 50 miles.</p><h3>Total Addressable Market</h3><p>This section hasn&#8217;t really changed over the last couple of weeks. Basically e-commerce penetration among the used car market is tiny. Bullish investors think the market for buying and selling used cars online should be an order of magnitude greater than it is today. Due to CarLotz different buying process, management says that there are 12 million vehicles sold through corporate sources and if CarLotz can be the main retailer to sell these cars, that could be very beneficial for CarLotz. Besides that though, there are many similarities between CarLotz and the other companies mentioned like Vroom, Carvana, Shift, and Carmax.</p><p>Currently, the total used car market is massive with most sources estimating the TAM above $<strong>750bn</strong>. Assuming 40 million used cars are bought and sold every year, slap on an average selling price of ~$18,750 and we can back into an estimated TAM of $750bn. Of course there are probably some fluctuations in the market size depending on whether or not you include financing or other revenue opportunities. Also would highlight that this industry doesn&#8217;t lend itself to high gross margins because of the buying and selling of cars which there isn&#8217;t much markup on.</p><p>One interesting quote from Carlotz&#8217;s management team which said:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;But the used -- one of the things we love about the used vehicle market is that it is remarkably steady at the consumer demand side. In almost any economic climate, there are 40 million cars that sell, and we've seen that over several decades. And in a bad market, maybe it will drop to 39 or 38. In a good market, it will go to 41 or 42. But it really stays within that tight band.&#8221;</p><p>&#8212; Michael Bor</p><p>CarLotz Presents at ICR Conference 2021, January 2021</p></blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t think I have anything else to add to this section this week. I think it&#8217;s pretty self-explanatory (or at least I&#8217;ve already explained it) so I&#8217;ll save you some time. If you are a new subscriber, feel free to read through my shallow dive on <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/carvana">Carvana</a> and <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/vroom">Vroom</a> if you want to learn more about this industry and why the TAM is estimated to be so massive.</p><h3>Competitive Advantages</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Scale</strong></p><p>I&#8217;ve been saying this for weeks now, but I do think that scale is the strongest competitive advantage in this space and something that these companies will need to survive and thrive.</p><p>For example, used car retailers with scale can have cheaper shipping prices because of the density of the hubs and different retail locations. If shipping is cheaper, then this retailer can offer lower prices or match the price as a competitor without the less expensive shipping. The used car retailer with cheaper shipping will either be able to offer better prices for consumers or reinvest in its business with higher profits. </p><p>Better prices for consumers leads to more demand which might feed more purchases and therefore better scale over time. Higher profits can be reinvested in the business to grow scale and build more hubs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Corporate sourcing partners</strong></p><p>I think this could be a competitive advantage for CarLotz. It&#8217;s definitely unique and I haven&#8217;t come across it so explicitly among the other companies I&#8217;ve looked into. If these corporate sourcing partners and CarLotz are joined at the hip through the various processes of selling a car, then maybe it keeps competitors like Carvana out.</p><p>Here is a quote from one of CarLotz&#8217;s earnings call that discuss the work that goes on between CarLotz and its' corporate sourcing partners:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;We have business intelligence and data analytics to help [corporate sourcing partners] figure out how to triage vehicles between wholesale and retail, which ones should come to us, which ones should go straight to wholesale, depending on what's selling well at retail and what has high consumer demand, low consumer demand, conditions of vehicles, et cetera.</p><p>We have very wholesome reporting that enables our clients to look by year, make, model, mileage band, reconditioning totals and figure out what makes the most sense for retailer marketing and what should be sold at wholesale. We've also created proprietary condition reporting apps that gives our clients a tremendous amount of detail into the condition of their vehicles because oftentimes, we're picking up the vehicles and selling them without our clients having seen the vehicles. These are vehicles that are being driven by our clients' clients. And so having a good sense of what their condition is, at the time the vehicle is returned, helps them bill back charges that may be required to get the vehicle into good shape.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>While of course some of this might just be management spilling a story, I&#8217;m not trying to pitch you an idea or recommend that you invest in this company. I&#8217;m writing about what I find interesting and if I were to study these companies more in-depth these are some of the areas I&#8217;d look to research and have an answer for. </p></li></ul><h3>Financials</h3><p>CarLotz has some impressive goals that it wants to accomplish. CarLotz is aiming to do $1.5 billion in revenue in 2023. By building more hubs, increasing scale, and reinvesting in the business, management is optimistic about accomplishing this target.</p><p>CarLotz recognizes retail gross profit per unit as (retail vehicle gross profit + finance and insurance gross profit) / retail unit sales. CarLotz&#8217;s finance and insurance revenue is also 100% gross profit.  </p><h4>2020</h4><ul><li><p>Retail vehicle sales = ~ $104,253</p></li><li><p>Finance and insurance sales = ~ $3,898</p></li><li><p>Retail vehicle gross profit = ~ $7,270</p></li><li><p>Retail units sold = 6,215</p></li><li><p>Retail gross profit per unit = ~ $1,797 </p></li><li><p>Number of hubs = 8</p></li><li><p><em>Retail revenue growth = 15.3%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Finance and insurance revenue growth = 25.1%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Retail gross margin = 7.0%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Percentage of sales via consignment = 66.0%</em></p></li></ul><h4>2019</h4><ul><li><p>Retail vehicle sales = ~ $90,382</p></li><li><p>Finance and insurance sales = ~ $3,117</p></li><li><p>Retail vehicle gross profit = ~ $5,848</p></li><li><p>Retail units sold = 6,435</p></li><li><p>Retail gross profit per unit = ~ $1,393</p></li><li><p>Number of hubs = 8</p></li><li><p><em>Retail revenue growth = 69.1%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Finance and insurance revenue growth = 93.8%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Retail gross margin = 6.5%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Percentage of sales via consignment = 46.0%</em></p></li></ul><h4>2018</h4><ul><li><p>Retail vehicle sales = ~ $53,448</p></li><li><p>Finance and insurance sales = ~ $1,608</p></li><li><p>Retail vehicle gross profit = ~ $4,925</p></li><li><p>Retail units sold = 4,077</p></li><li><p>Retail gross profit per unit = ~ $1,602</p></li><li><p>Number of hubs = 8</p></li><li><p><em>Retail gross margin = 9.2%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Percentage of sales via consignment = 41.0%</em></p></li></ul><p>On the surface, I&#8217;m disappointed in the growth in 2020 but understandable when looking at how much the world changed in 2020. Also disappointing that CarLotz hasn&#8217;t grown the number of hubs in the past couple of years but that is a focus for them going forward.</p><h3>What&#8217;s Interesting</h3><ul><li><p><strong>In-house reconditioning centers?</strong></p><blockquote><p>&#8220;We also are adamant about being in control over the quality of the vehicle. And so we see quality is much better when we handle it ourselves. Also, if a client comes back or wants to exchange the vehicle or has an issue post sale, we can handle it much better when we are managing the process. So we view having total control over reconditioning to be a key part in the markets outside of Virginia, to be a key part of this 84 NPS score we're offering to our clients. Because it gives us the ability to really control the process and the quality of the vehicle that we're selling.&#8221;</p><p>&#8212; Michael Bor</p></blockquote><p>This isn&#8217;t necessarily an interesting point for CarLotz specifically but more so for the rest of the industry. There&#8217;s some discussion about the need for companies to have its own reconditioning centers and whether or not this is an efficient use of capital, but so far Carvana, Shift, CarMax, and now CarLotz all recommend and embrace having in-house reconditioning centers. That&#8217;s not a great look for Vroom (which doesn&#8217;t have its own reconditioning centers).</p></li><li><p><strong>Corporate sourcing partners</strong></p><p>While other used car retailers likely buy from these corporate sources, CarLotz seems to be rather close with some of these partners. These sources contribute roughly 12 million used cars a year to the 40 million total unit sales. CarLotz doesn&#8217;t need to capture a significant portion of these units in order to have tremendous results. While these partners sell through wholesale and retail channels, CarLotz might be able to capture enough unit sales in order to drive impressive financial results.  </p></li></ul><h3>Future Questions</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Stickiness of corporate sourcing relationship?</strong></p><p>I think this is an interesting aspect of the business like I&#8217;ve already touched on. I think this could be a massive benefit and is a differentiating factor for CarLotz when compared to other companies. If CarLotz can even crack 1% of the 12 million unit sales, CarLotz will likely have massive success. This is much easier to say than do, but it&#8217;s also not impossible given CarLotz already has this relationship established.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hub growth?</strong></p><p>I think this is the primary driver of CarLotz and management understands that and is looking to expand the number of hubs across the country. Growing hub locations helps to increase density, decrease costs (such as shipping), and improving the number of consumers that CarLotz can reach. I don&#8217;t think is a very differentiated factor compared to CarLotz&#8217;s competitors, but I do think it is important for this business to succeed and reach its $1.5 billion revenue goal for 2023. </p></li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about CarLotz. I like some parts of the business but I also worry about CarLotz&#8217;s lack of existing scale and whether or not some aspects of this business are truly differentiated and whether or not CarLotz will have a sustainable competitive advantage going forward. At some price (I don&#8217;t know what number) this might be an attractive opportunity purely based off the risk/reward ratio, but I don&#8217;t have a price target.</p><div><hr></div><p>If you&#8217;ve enjoyed this edition of Weekly 10-K please considering subscribing below, sharing it with friends and colleagues, or following me on <a href="https://twitter.com/StratusYoung">Twitter</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[#022 - Shift Technologies]]></title><description><![CDATA[Shift is another online used car retailer.

There are older existing companies such as CarMax trying to capture more market share and newer companies such as Carvana, Vroom, and Shift that are trying to out perform the &#8220;legacy&#8221; competitors. </p><p>I&#8217;ve been researching this space for the past couple weeks and one of the main concerns I&#8217;ve been thinking about and reading about is that since capital is so cheap right now, it might not take much for new companies and competitors to try and compete with the companies mentioned above, drive down pricing, and take away any profits that these companies might be able to capture.</p><p>On the flip side, just because there are many companies competing in a space doesn&#8217;t mean there won&#8217;t be a handful of winners and many losers. Over the long-term, the winners will prevail while the losers die off. I&#8217;m sure 20 years ago there were many companies trying to compete with Amazon, but nowadays we only hear about Amazon. Maybe, the same can be said for the online used car industry? Competition alone shouldn&#8217;t scare you away. Competition combined with the inability to see a winner emerge should scare you away.</p><p>If you want to get a more complete picture of the used car industry, feel free to read through my shallow dives on <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/carvana">Carvana</a> and <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/vroom">Vroom</a>. These companies buy cars from wholesale auctions, from consumers, or through other sources and try to fix these cars up and sell them to consumers.   </p><h3>Business Overview</h3><p>Shift Technologies is another online used car retailer similar to <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/carvana">Carvana</a> and <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/vroom">Vroom</a>. Shift went public via a SPAC in October and has been public since then.</p><p>Shift&#8217;s main locations are on the west coast, &#8220;we currently operate six West Coast Hubs capable of reaching over 85%&nbsp;of the California population and a large portion of the populations of Oregon and Washington.&#8221; Shift has also recently expanded into Seattle and some cities in Texas. The bull thesis is pretty easy to uncover. &#8220;Shift will be able to expand into more cities across the country, add on additional services (primarily financing in-house), and through a large enough scale, turn a profit.&#8221; Shift is a pretty small company based on its market cap (~$640 million) relative to the other companies I&#8217;ve covered over the past few weeks.</p><p>Shift has a similar business model to both Carvana and Vroom. Shift operates its own reconditioning centers and logistics operations (for the most part) but relies on some third parties for reconditioning and transporting vehicles when Shift&#8217;s existing facilities can&#8217;t handle the amount of cars being bought and sold by Shift. Shift relies on 3rd party finance companies for financing a vehicle purchase for its customers. Shift takes a small commission of any financing transactions and recognizes this as revenue with 100% gross profit margins. Other companies like Carvana and CarMax perform varying degrees of financing in-house. Shift&#8217;s management team has talked about potentially bringing financing in-house but recognizes that is a long ways away:</p><blockquote><p>"You have to be like probably $800 million in revenue a year to kind of seriously think about any kind of captive business. Because if you assume half of the cars that you sell will be sold through captive, that gets you about $100 million a quarter in revenue to securitize in terms of captive loans. And so we are like a while away from that.&#8221; </p><p>- <strong>George Arison</strong> (Shift Founder and Co-CEO)</p><p>23rd Annual Needham Virtual Growth Conference</p></blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t think Shift has many features or services that are much different than Carvana and Vroom or that competitors won&#8217;t be able to imitate. One part that Shift seems to advertise that I don&#8217;t truly understand why it&#8217;s so valuable is the ability to have an &#8220;on-demand test drive.&#8221; Why is a test drive any better than having a 7 day return policy. I think consumers like to test drive a vehicle, but why can&#8217;t Carvana and others copy this? Maybe competitors can&#8217;t offer an &#8220;on-demand test drive&#8221; but will this really be a major difference between purchasing a vehicle on Carvana&#8217;s platform or Shift&#8217;s platform? Shift offers both a 7 day return policy and an on-demand test drive, but I think the return policy is a more attractive option of the two (but the return policy isn&#8217;t unique to Shift). </p><p>I think if you&#8217;re optimistic about the online used car industry, I don&#8217;t know why you&#8217;d be more optimistic about Shift over Vroom, Carvana, or CarMax. If you don&#8217;t like the other three companies for company specific reasons, then maybe you&#8217;ll like Shift but that&#8217;s your decision.</p><h3>Total Addressable Market</h3><p>This section hasn&#8217;t really changed over the last couple of weeks. The used car market is a massive market with most estimates above <strong>$750bn</strong>. Assuming 40 million used cars are bought and sold every year, slap on an average selling price of ~$18,750 and we reach our estimate of a TAM of $750bn. </p><p>I don&#8217;t think I have anything to add here this week so I&#8217;ll save you some time. If you are a new subscriber, feel free to read through my shallow dive on <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/carvana">Carvana</a> and <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/vroom">Vroom</a> if you want to learn more about this industry and why the TAM is estimated to be so massive.</p><h3>Competitive Advantages</h3><p>I don&#8217;t really think Shift currently has any competitive advantages or at least no competitive advantages that are strong enough for me to choose this company over other online used car retailers.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Scale&#8230;if Shift can get there</strong></p><p>I think scale is a large factor in this industry. Scale allows companies to afford more inventory, more brand advertising, and more density of its supply chain (reconditioning and logistics). </p><p>In the 10-K, Shift acknowledges the lack of scale by saying its locations only reach, &#8220;14%&nbsp;of the U.S. population, we have significant runway for continued expansion&#8221; but management is optimistic about expanding. I&#8217;m just not sure if Shift can successfully expand into new areas and further afford more vertical integration and the scale advantages that come with it.</p><p>Other larger competitors will be able to leverage a brand name much cheaper and easier than Shift will be able to. Carvana is already reaching a lot of the US population and CarMax is too.</p></li><li><p><strong>Brand</strong></p><p>I think branding will be important when buying a used car online and even in-person. You need to have a great experience in order to feel comfortable buying a used car (likely you&#8217;re second most expensive purchase). </p><p>If you don&#8217;t feel comfortable buying a car through an online retailer or you have friends who haven&#8217;t had good experiences, that may turn you away from Shift or other online used car retailers. If Shift can develop a brand (something unlimited amounts of capital can&#8217;t take away) then maybe it can have a stronger competitive advantage but I don&#8217;t think it has a superior competitive advantage today.</p><p>Unless you live in one of the areas that Shift has a hub, then I doubt you&#8217;ve heard of Shift if you&#8217;re a consumer. I haven&#8217;t even heard of it before doing research on some competitors in this industry. You&#8217;re much more likely to have heard of Carvana, Vroom, and CarMax simply because of scale and national branding.</p></li></ul><h3>Financials</h3><p>Similar financial results to Carvana and Vroom. I&#8217;m somewhat disappointed with the revenue growth as other companies (mainly Carvana) has better growth, but still commendable results. Many investors still have concerns about the scalability of this business and whether or not gross margins or even net income margins will improve to support the valuation of some of these businesses.</p><p>Not surprising given Shift&#8217;s business model, but &#8220;other revenue&#8221; which is mainly &#8220;financing and vehicle protection products&#8230;and other ancillary products&#8221; which are offered through Shift but other 3rd party sources take the bulk of the costs and Shift just collects a commission.  </p><h4>2020</h4><ul><li><p>Ecommerce revenue = ~ $158.0 million</p></li><li><p>Other revenue = ~ $6.4 million</p></li><li><p>Wholesale revenue = ~ $31.3 million</p></li><li><p>Ecommerce gross profit = ~ $4.1 million</p></li><li><p>Other gross profit = ~ $6.4 million</p></li><li><p>Wholesale gross profit = ~ $1.7 million</p></li><li><p>Ecommerce vehicle unit sales = 9,497</p></li><li><p>Wholesale vehicle unit sales = 3,638</p></li><li><p>Ecommerce gross profit per unit = $434</p></li><li><p>Other gross profit per unit = $673</p></li><li><p>Wholesale gross profit per unit = $176 </p></li><li><p><em>Ecommerce revenue growth = 16.8%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Other revenue growth = 102.9%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Wholesale revenue growth = 12.5%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Ecommerce gross profit margins = 2.6%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Wholesale gross profit margins = 5.3%</em></p></li></ul><h4>2019</h4><ul><li><p>Ecommerce revenue = ~ $135.3 million</p></li><li><p>Other revenue = ~ $3.1 million</p></li><li><p>Wholesale revenue = ~ $27.8 million</p></li><li><p>Ecommerce gross profit = ~ $4.0 million</p></li><li><p>Other gross profit = ~ $3.1 million</p></li><li><p>Wholesale gross profit = ~ -$8.9 million</p></li><li><p>Ecommerce vehicle unit sales = 8,263</p></li><li><p>Wholesale vehicle unit sales = 2,828</p></li><li><p>Ecommerce gross profit per unit = $485</p></li><li><p>Other gross profit per unit = $381</p></li><li><p>Wholesale gross profit per unit = -$1080 </p></li><li><p><em>Ecommerce revenue growth = 10.1%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Other revenue growth = 20.4%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Wholesale revenue growth = 341.0%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Ecommerce gross profit margins = 3.0%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Wholesale gross profit margins = -32.1%</em></p></li></ul><h4>2018</h4><ul><li><p>Ecommerce revenue = ~ $122.9 million</p></li><li><p>Other revenue = ~ $2.6 million</p></li><li><p>Wholesale revenue = ~ $6.3 million</p></li><li><p>Ecommerce gross profit = ~ $2.5 million</p></li><li><p>Other gross profit = ~ $2.6 million</p></li><li><p>Wholesale gross profit = ~ $0.3 million</p></li><li><p>Ecommerce vehicle unit sales = 7,232</p></li><li><p>Wholesale vehicle unit sales = 1,248</p></li><li><p>Ecommerce gross profit per unit = $348</p></li><li><p>Other gross profit per unit = $362</p></li><li><p>Wholesale gross profit per unit = $35</p></li><li><p><em>Ecommerce revenue growth = 38.3%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Other revenue growth = 35.5%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Wholesale revenue growth = 68.7%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Ecommerce gross profit margins = 2.0%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Wholesale gross profit margins = 4.0%</em></p></li></ul><h3>What&#8217;s Interesting</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Importance of in-house processes</strong></p><p>Not really specific to Shift, but management has harped on the fact that having the major processes of this business in-house is critical to this business. I think the comment below bodes well for Carvana and CarMax, but not necessarily for Vroom. Vroom relies more on 3rd parties and says it&#8217;s better for capital allocation and being able to run lean, but other business leaders might differ.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;But everything else that we can bring in, we kind of aim to bring in because we do think the full stack of experience is really important. So logistics and reconditioning are very much in-house for us. I don't -- I spoke to this a little bit earlier. I don't believe that you can kind of outsource that to somebody else.&#8221;</p><p>- <strong>George Arison</strong></p><p>Shift Technologies at 23rd Annual Needham Virtual Growth Conference</p></blockquote></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Helping independent dealerships?</strong></p><p>There was an interesting piece about working with local dealerships to help these businesses sell cars quicker by having more eyeballs looking at them.</p><blockquote><p>"And so I think that's the really unique opportunity is, "Hey, can 10%, 20%, 30% of your sales over the next 5 years be not cars that you directly own, but cars that are owned by dealers, that will be reconditioned by dealers, that are sold by dealers and that then were listed by you and sold through your experience?" So the same -- if you look at Amazon's growth, vast majority of the growth on the retail business has come actually from third-party items that Amazon still controls the shipping experience and the purchase for, but it doesn't actually own."</p></blockquote><p>I think this is an interesting observation and opportunity for companies in this space. While I don&#8217;t think this is like a main thesis point for most investors, I do think this could be interesting upside for many of these companies. Most companies are already working with 3rd parties to help them sell cars.</p></li></ul><h3>Future Questions</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Competition?</strong></p><p>I&#8217;m not sure how Shift can differentiate itself in a way that will make it a superior option over Carvana or CarMax. Shift is a much smaller company than Carvana, Vroom, and CarMax. I think this industry relies on scale in order to get better inventory, better national branding, and vertical integration in order to have a successful business in order to make a profit. I&#8217;m not sure how Shift will be able to get there considering Carvana is growing extremely fast and is already rolled out to a majority of the population.</p><p>Shift doesn&#8217;t have many different offerings that Carvana and others can&#8217;t just copy.</p></li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>I&#8217;m not very optimistic or bullish about Shift after researching other companies like Carvana and CarMax. I think some investors might see a better return with Shift just given the smaller size. I&#8217;d rather invest in a fat pitch and Shift just isn&#8217;t a fat pitch (or even close to being a strike for me). Shift is under a billion dollar market cap which means it&#8217;s likely much easier for Shift to 10x than it might be for Carvana to 10x, but it also might be more likely for Shift to fail than it will be for Carvana or CarMax.</p><p>If you have a different perspective I&#8217;d love to hear it, either comment below or DM me on Twitter @ StratusYoung.</p><div><hr></div><p>If you&#8217;ve enjoyed this edition of Weekly 10-K please considering subscribing below, sharing it with friends and colleagues, or following me on <a href="https://twitter.com/StratusYoung">Twitter</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[#021 - CarMax]]></title><description><![CDATA[CarMax sells used cars.

CarMax is another company that has a similar business model of selling used cars. While there are many companies that sell cars online, I still think there can be strategies or companies that stand out from the rest. </p><p>I don&#8217;t think I have anything major to add to the <strong>Industry Overview </strong>section of this writeup. I think CarMax is pretty similar to Carvana with some slight differences that I&#8217;ll touch on.</p><h3>Business Overview</h3><p>CarMax buys used cars and sells these cars to consumers. CarMax separates its business into two reported segments, but really has three different business lines. Selling cars to consumers, selling cars wholesale, and a financing/other side of the business. &#8220;CarMax Sales Operations&#8221; represents the used vehicle sales (both to consumers and wholesale) and &#8220;CarMax Auto Finance&#8221; (CAF) represents financing, protection plans, and other revenue of the business.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Our CAF segment consists solely of our own finance operation that provides financing to customers buying retail vehicles from CarMax.&#8221; - CarMax FY2020 10-K</p></blockquote><p>I&#8217;ll touch on this later in the <strong>Financials</strong> section below, but CarMax makes most of its revenue and gross profit from selling used cars to consumers, but it&#8217;s profit margins on  selling used cars is a lot lower than it&#8217;s profit margin on &#8220;other&#8221; revenue.</p><p>There are a handful of difference between CarMax and the rest of the used car retailers. </p><p>The first difference is that CarMax offers an omnichannel selling approach. CarMax has both in-person lots and a website consumers can visit to buy a car. Carvana and others don&#8217;t offer this and likely won&#8217;t offer this in a major way going forward. With CarMax, you can get the comfort of seeing a car in person if that&#8217;s what you need to get comfortable buying a car or you can buy online just like any other used car retailers. CarMax has higher fixed costs (due to all the land and lots they own) but this might be an advantage if CarMax can have scale across the country and offer better prices than competitors. Roughly half of CarMax&#8217;s stores double as reconditioning centers.</p><p>CarMax is different from dealerships because there is no negotiation. CarMax has &#8220;no-haggle pricing&#8221; which means the price you see is the price you get. Customers may interact with CarMax sales people, but the sales people are compensated a flat rate if they sell you a unit. They are therefore motivated to sell you something, but they want to sell you something that works for you. </p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Customers may also interact in-person with our sales consultants who are generally paid commissions on a <strong>fixed dollars-per-unit standard</strong>, thereby earning the same commission regardless of the vehicle being sold, the amount a customer finances or the related interest rate. These pay structures align our associates&#8217; interests with those of our customers, in contrast to other dealerships where sales and finance personnel may receive higher commissions for negotiating higher prices and interest rates, or steering customers to vehicles with higher gross profits.&#8221; - CarMax 10-K</p></blockquote><p>The last major difference between CarMax and others is that CarMax takes a hybrid approach for its lending/financing side of the business. CarMax uses both an in-house financing setup (CAF basically) and relies on third parties to help consumers buy a car. CarMax partners with other parties when CarMax isn&#8217;t comfortable lending to certain consumers. There are four different options consumers have for financing needs. First, CarMax customers can use CAF to finance their purchase. Second, CarMax works with &#8220;Tier 2&#8221; providers who help customers finance a purchase. These Tier 2 providers pay CarMax a fee because CarMax refers business to these providers. &#8220;Tier 3&#8221; providers works the same way as Tier 2, but CarMax pays these providers a fee for giving customers financing to buy a CarMax vehicle. And then there&#8217;s a certain portion of the customer base that either doesn&#8217;t use financing or uses financing from a bank or some other financial institution. Close to ~46% of used vehicle financing is performed by CarMax, with the rest being split between Tier 2, Tier 3, and other options. CarMax is in between Carvana and Vroom. Vroom uses 3rd parties whereas Carvana does all of this in house.  </p><h3>Total Addressable Market</h3><p>If you&#8217;ve already read my research on <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/carvana">Carvana</a> and <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/vroom">Vroom</a>, you know the pitch for this industry. Large fragmented market with no real winner at scale. I think that leads to some warranted concerns such as, &#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t a scaled winner exist in this space? Is scaling a business even possible in this industry?&#8221; On the other hand, it might mean there&#8217;s an opportunity for a company like CarMax or Carvana to win this space.</p><p>Most estimates have this market pegged at around $750bn+. Which I think is a rationale estimate, but I don&#8217;t think the profit will be anywhere close to that given the costs of buying inventory (cars), shipping it around, fixing it up, and then selling it along with protection plans and financing. Profits likely improve with scale, but no where close to regular software or platform businesses. </p><p>One of the key questions that I have for companies in this space is how much market share each company can capture. Can the winners in this space realistically capture 10%? 15%? 25% More? CarMax has captured ~3.5% of a segment of the broader market. This is a small number and this leads me to some more questions that can be found below if I were to continue to research CarMax and this overall space. </p><blockquote><p>&#8220;On a nationwide basis, we estimate we sold approximately&nbsp;3.5%&nbsp;of the age 0- to 10-year old vehicles sold in calendar year&nbsp;2019.&#8221; CarMax FY2020 10-K</p></blockquote><h3>Competitive Advantages</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Scale</strong></p><p>My thoughts here on competitive advantage will be very similar to my thoughts about Carvana&#8217;s competitive advantage. Used car retailers need a lot more than just a website to sell cars. These retailers need logistics to transport the cars, lots to store the cars, reconditioning space for repairs, and other investments that relate to financing cars, relationships with banks and other credit unions, and other aspects to run this business at scale.</p><p>This also isn&#8217;t really a sexy business. There isn&#8217;t a line of MIT computer science students trying to break into this industry and win market share. </p></li><li><p><strong>Brand</strong></p><p>I think branding is and will be pretty important for used car retailers. Buying a car is one of your most expensive purchases as a consumer and you want to get it right. Even buying a ~$10k junky used car might be one of your most expensive purchases and you&#8217;ll spend plenty of time researching the car, the background of the car, and you want to trust the company that is selling you the car.</p><p>If you have a bad experience buying a car at CarMax or elsewhere, you might never return and you&#8217;ll likely spread your experience to friends, colleagues, or rant online. People will read those reviews and these used car retailers will have a bad image of this brand.

Other companies like Carvana had extraordinary growth in 2020 due to the pandemic and the rush to buying cars online. CarMax was slow to transition and may have lost a solid opportunity to compete with Carvana. But CarMax does deserve some credit for being the current leader in this space and it has been the leader for some time now.</p></li><li><p><strong>Omnichannel?</strong></p><p>I think for some consumers, they will never buy a car online just because the cost of buying a used car can be so expensive. Many consumers may want to have the option to look at a car in-person (and test drive it) or look at a car online. There are pros and cons to both of these decisions and giving customers the ability to choose may be an important factor in their buying process.</p></li></ul><h3>Future Questions</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Financing?</strong></p><p>Carvana and CarMax both have their financing process in-house. I don&#8217;t have a background or any previous knowledge into the financing space, so I think I&#8217;d need to learn more about this side of the business to feel more comfortable investing in one of these businesses. </p><p>I tried to read a couple write-ups or just background on this side of the business, but I definitely need to focus on this area of the business more.</p></li><li><p><strong>Market share penetration?</strong></p><p>I still wonder what is and has stopped more mature companies like CarMax from capturing more market share. I understand scaling and building new stores in new locations is likely the biggest problem, but CarMax has more than 200 stores now. Do consumers just rely on other methods of buying a car like buying it from a friend or neighbor? Do consumers buy from other dealerships rather than a CarMax or a Carvana?</p><p>What is the upper limit on how much farther CarMax can go into this market? Is there something stopping them? Is it just issues with scaling?</p></li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>CarMax is interesting but I worry that Carvana&#8217;s revenue growth is just blowing them out of the water. A couple of years ago, Carvana wasn&#8217;t even close to CarMax, but no Carvana might surpass CarMax if all goes well.</p><div><hr></div><p>If you&#8217;ve enjoyed this edition of Weekly 10-K please considering subscribing below, sharing it with friends and colleagues, or following me on <a href="https://twitter.com/StratusYoung">Twitter</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[#020 - Carvana]]></title><description><![CDATA[Carvana buys and sells used cars.

The used car industry may seem kinda bland or like a sketchy industry, but I think that means there might be opportunities in this sector and it&#8217;s worth pursuing. This space peaked my interests so I&#8217;m researching it.</p><p>Buying a car (used or new) can cause headaches for many consumers. Most people don&#8217;t have the best impression of car salesmen. People don&#8217;t want to spend a whole day negotiating over prices, financing, upgrades, and every other item that goes into buying a car. </p><p>Consumers can do their own research on the internet, determine what&#8217;s a fair price, and come to their own conclusions. Consumers can buy a car at home and have it delivered to their home. The internet helps to increase the number of SKUs available to consumers. Instead of having one dealership serve a small radius, Carvana can serve a larger radius with its logistics and last mile delivery option. </p><p>Consumers can go to dealerships (independent or franchised), try and buy a car from a friend, neighbor, or other person, or look to buy a car online. If you&#8217;ve done your research and you know what you want, wouldn&#8217;t it make sense to buy a car online assuming the company offers a return policy so you can test drive it on your own and take it to a mechanic? If you truly believe that buying a car is a hassle and people would rather purchase a car online and have it delivered, why isn&#8217;t an online used car retailer a good business idea (in theory it should be a good idea, in practice it might be totally different). If pricing for online used car retailers is within the same ballpark as dealerships, why wouldn&#8217;t you buy a car online if it could save you the pain of negotiating?</p><p>There are certainly people who don&#8217;t think buying a car online will ever be a big deal.  There are others who have bought a car online and think it&#8217;s the future. The important thing to recognize is that the only important variables are what is the average consumer&#8217;s experience and is that trending up or down?</p><p>Of course, there are many concerns about car buying and Carvana has a whole list of concerns for many investors. I&#8217;m here to learn and write about what I&#8217;ve read and think. If you think differently, I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts in a civil discussion.</p><h3>Business Overview</h3><p>Carvana is similar to <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/vroom?r=abclk&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=copy">Vroom</a> in that it buys and sells used cars to consumers. Carvana is currently a retailer but has talked about being more than just a retailer by moving into being more of a marketplace that&#8217;s both 1P and 3P, meaning Carvana will be a retailer and a place for others to sell used cars online. This isn&#8217;t core to the Carvana thesis today, but it might be in a number of years.</p><p>Carvana collects revenue three different ways, through used vehicle, wholesale vehicle, and &#8220;other sales and revenues.&#8221; Used vehicle sales consist of (you guessed) selling vehicles to regulars consumers. Carvana buys car from a wide range of sources, brings these vehicles to an inspection and reconditioning center (IRCs), fixes up these vehicles, and sell it back to consumers. </p><p>Wholesale vehicle sales consist of Carvana selling used car units to other dealerships or other professional parties. Carvana&#8217;s in-house financing is &#8220;other sales and revenues&#8221; which consists of &#8220;gains on the sales of loans we originate, commissions we receive on sales of VSCs and sales of GAP waiver coverage.&#8221; Carvana then sells these finance receivables to banks like Ally Financial. Lots of investors have concerns about this in-house financing, but since I write a shallow dive, I did not dig too much into this piece of Carvana&#8217;s business model.</p><p>Carvana&#8217;s goal is to be fully vertically integrated. Carvana has its own fleet of inspection and reconditioning centers, an in-house auto logistics network, in-house customer support specialists, and even performs financing in-house. This is a huge difference from companies like Vroom. Vroom has a hybrid/asset-light business model where some business functions are in-house and some are outsourced to 3rd parties.</p><p>Carvana is run by Ernest Garcia III, who is the founder and CEO of Carvana. While I like to see companies run by owner-operators, there are still concerns about both Ernest Garcia III and his father, Ernest Garcia II. Carvana does have some serious scrutiny and doesn&#8217;t seem to be loved by too many investors, but there is still a strong opportunity in this space. Maybe Carvana isn&#8217;t the winner, but it doesn&#8217;t hurt to research Carvana to learn more about the space. While I think Carvana may be an attractive business from a high level perspective, there are plenty of other opportunities or &#8220;fat pitches&#8221; to be had. One doesn&#8217;t need to worry about missing Carvana when there are other attractive opportunities.</p><h3>Total Addressable Market</h3><p>There is massive potential for online, omni-channel, and physical used car retailers. The used car market is one of the largest industries and is very fragmented without any companies that capture a large portion of the market. The largest competitors in this space are CarMax and Carvana. There are other companies trying to compete in this space but Carvana and CarMax have had the most success thus far. </p><p>Many estimates (from both Carvana, other companies, and 3rd parties) have pegged this industry north of $750 billion. The market is large and fragmented. The largest player (CarMax) is said to have ~2% market share. Carvana is creeping up in some of their more mature markets. I&#8217;ve inserted a market penetration image from Carvana&#8217;s 10-K below.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230;101, 28, and 7 markets have now crossed the milestones of 1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0% market penetration, respectively, an increase from 23, 7, and 2, respectively last year. As in past years, we generally continue to see similar trends across markets, including newer markets, smaller markets, and more proximate markets ramping even faster than average.&#8221;</p><p><em>Carvana 10-K</em></p></blockquote><p>The image below is of Carvana&#8217;s market penetration since 2013. Most markets are trending nicely and will be interesting to see how far Carvana can penetrate some of these markets.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8de0f14-eb6e-456b-853b-8c6b11688567_1234x760.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8de0f14-eb6e-456b-853b-8c6b11688567_1234x760.jpeg" width="1234" height="760" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c8de0f14-eb6e-456b-853b-8c6b11688567_1234x760.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:760,&quot;width&quot;:1234,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:127795,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8de0f14-eb6e-456b-853b-8c6b11688567_1234x760.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8de0f14-eb6e-456b-853b-8c6b11688567_1234x760.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8de0f14-eb6e-456b-853b-8c6b11688567_1234x760.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8de0f14-eb6e-456b-853b-8c6b11688567_1234x760.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>While this is a large space and Carvana continues to capture more market share, there are still concerns. Some investors worry that scaling in this market is much harder than Carvana has made it appear thus far and that Carvana may hit a road block when trying to penetrate more markets and penetrate existing markets more deeply.</p><h3>Competitive Advantages</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Scale Economics Shared</strong></p><p>I think this one is likely a stretch but I think could be interesting. Basically if Carvana passes on potential scale advantages to customers then competitors will be unable to win any market share in this industry. Carvana&#8217;s infrastructure may be nearly impossible to build if companies aren&#8217;t able to compete on price and win market share and then reinvest in the business. </p><p>If you&#8217;re buying used cars and assuming every car has the same mileage, dents, or damages, then you&#8217;ll shop at the company that has the lowest prices. Carvana&#8217;s vertical integration gives them an advantage of having everything in house and not relying on any third parties that take savings away from customers.</p><p>Of course, this competitive advantage is impossible without scale. Carvana is investing in its infrastructure and has taken years of work and likely billions of dollars to build out this infrastructure and it won&#8217;t be an easy thing for competitors to copy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Brand</strong></p><p>If you have a great experience with Carvana then you&#8217;ll likely return in 5-6 years or however often to buy another used car (or maybe a new car in the future). If you have a great experience you&#8217;re also likely to tell your family, friends, and colleagues about it. This will spread the experience (good or bad) to others and will spread through word of mouth. Just like Amazon initially had great customer service and made consumers more comfortable, what if Carvana is able to build a strong and trusted brand?</p></li></ul><h3>Financials</h3><p>Just a heads up, Carvana does not make a profit. This likely isn&#8217;t very surprising for many investors that follow Carvana or follow tech, but that doesn&#8217;t mean there aren&#8217;t interesting things to learn from Carvana.</p><p>I decided to focus on used vehicle sales and &#8220;other sales and revenue&#8221; (the financing portion) because I think these are the two most critical drivers for this business. Carvana has grown quite well over the past couple years and has even benefitted from COVID-19.</p><h4>2020</h4><ul><li><p>Used vehicle sales = ~ $4.7 billion</p></li><li><p>Other sales and revenue = ~ $400 million</p></li><li><p>Used vehicle gross profit = ~ $359 million</p></li><li><p>Used vehicles sold = 244,111</p></li><li><p>Wholesale vehicles sold = 55,204</p></li><li><p>Used vehicle per unit gross profit = $1,472</p></li><li><p>Other per unit gross profit = $1,642</p></li><li><p>Number of markets = 266</p></li><li><p><em>Used vehicle YOY revenue growth = 38.6%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Other sales and revenues YOY revenue growth =59.2%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Used vehicle gross profit margin = 7.6%</em></p></li></ul><h4>2019</h4><ul><li><p>Used vehicle sales = ~ $3.4 billion</p></li><li><p>Other sales and revenue = ~ $252 million</p></li><li><p>Used vehicle gross profit = ~ $238 million</p></li><li><p>Used vehicles sold = 177,549</p></li><li><p>Wholesale vehicles sold = 39,895</p></li><li><p>Used vehicle per unit gross profit = $1,340</p></li><li><p>Other per unit gross profit = $1,418</p></li><li><p>Number of markets = 146</p></li><li><p><em>Used vehicle YOY revenue growth = 91.6%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Other sales and revenues YOY revenue growth = 159.9%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Used vehicle gross profit margin = 7.0%</em></p></li></ul><h4>2018</h4><ul><li><p>Used vehicle sales = ~ $1.8bn</p></li><li><p>Other sales and revenue = ~ $97 million</p></li><li><p>Used vehicle gross profit = ~ $94 million</p></li><li><p>Used vehicles sold = 94,108</p></li><li><p>Wholesale vehicles sold = 15,125</p></li><li><p>Used vehicle per unit gross profit = $1,002</p></li><li><p>Other per unit gross profit = $1,029</p></li><li><p>Number of markets = 85</p></li><li><p><em>Used vehicle YOY revenue growth = 124.0%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Other sales and revenues YOY revenue growth = 189.6%</em></p></li><li><p><em>Used vehicle gross profit margin = 5.3%</em></p></li></ul><h3>What&#8217;s Interesting</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Large fragmented market?</strong></p><p>I touched on this aspect in my shallow dive on <a href="https://weekly10k.substack.com/p/vroom?r=abclk&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=copy">Vroom</a>, I think this is one of the most exciting aspects of this industry and why I&#8217;m doing some shallow dives on companies in this space. If there is a company who can effectively scale and become the largest used car retailer and capture more than a 2% market share, then that company might be a big business. The question that needs to be asked is just how much can one company penetrate this market, is it 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%? While these percentage points may seem small and insignificant, when using it to compare to the size of this market, that could be tens of billions of dollars.</p></li><li><p><strong>Carvana&#8217;s in-house infrastructure?</strong></p><p>Carvana has spent years and plenty of money investing in building out its own infrastructure without relying on third parties. Other companies like Vroom work with 3rd parties, but this means Vroom can&#8217;t control the whole customer experience nor save costs for consumers. Building this infrastructure hasn&#8217;t been easy and Carvana has struggled over the years as a result. I believe this infrastructure is where Carvana&#8217;s potential competitive advantage stems from. </p></li></ul><h3>Future Questions</h3><ul><li><p><strong>What are some opportunities beyond being a 1P retailer?</strong></p><p>Carvana is primarily a 1P retailer right now, but I do think there are interesting upsides that investors don&#8217;t give them much credit for. If you think creatively about Carvana, what if Carvana becomes a marketplace that is both 1P and 3P? What if Carvana allows other companies to sell cars on its platform? Do these companies have to use Carvana&#8217;s inspection centers, logistics, or financing? If Carvana is helping these companies do more business and is doing a lot of the work in the process, what does Carvana charges these parties?</p><p>Carvana&#8217;s infrastructure may also be appealing. Just like Amazon has turned its cost centers into profit centers (<a href="https://twitter.com/BrianFeroldi/status/1284795114187919362?s=20">link</a>), what if Carvana can do the same with its inspection and reconditioning centers, logistics infrastructure, and financing?</p><p>While these are all very hypothetical points and shouldn&#8217;t be involved in a regular bull case for Carvana, I think there are very interesting and compelling opportunities for Carvana.</p></li><li><p><strong>How much can Carvana penetrate this market?</strong></p><p>The largest company in this space (CarMax and increasingly Carvana) has very little market share. Some estimates have CarMax at around 2% market share across the country and Carvana has market share of ~2% in some of its more mature markets. While there are plenty of reasons that companies might not be able to capture a large market share in the past, if there is a company that is able to capture a large market share, it would be handsomely rewarded.</p><p>This will be rough math, but let&#8217;s play a little scenario, assuming this industry is $750bn. Carvana captures 20% market share, $150bn in revenue. 10% profit margins, $15bn in profit. Apply a 20x multiple, you get a $300bn business. While there are issues with this framework such as dilution, how long this takes to play out, whether or not capturing 20% market share is even feasible, if 10% profit margins are realistic, and then claims of fraud, this is an interesting framework and depending on your comfort in the business and management team, this could be an attractive investment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Financing?</strong></p><p>While I just glossed over financing in this shallow dive, I think this is an important area that I would need to understand in order to feel confident investing in Carvana. There are many resources out there to understand the lending and finance portion of this business, but I won&#8217;t be able to cover that information in a shallow dive.</p></li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Look, if you follow Carvana or have even heard about the company before, you are likely to know all about the concerns. You might even be roasting me or rolling your eyes thinking I&#8217;m insane, and honestly I might be a little insane, but I like to read about the bear thesis and write about the bull thesis. I saw this quote and think it&#8217;s true &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1324386805010096130">Pessimists sound smart. Optimists retire young on beaches.</a>&#8221; </p><p>I try to be optimistic in my analysis of a company because I think being optimistic is better than being a pessimist and missing opportunities. While this isn&#8217;t the case for Carvana, if you wait to invest in an opportunity with zero risk, you&#8217;ll live a boring and complacent life. I write shallow dives to filter through businesses quickly and find the companies that stick out to me the most and then I follow them on my own. I hope this newsletter can do the same for you.</p><div><hr></div><p>If you&#8217;ve enjoyed this edition of Weekly 10-K please considering subscribing below, sharing it with friends and colleagues, or following me on <a href="https://twitter.com/StratusYoung">Twitter</a>.</p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[#019 - Vroom]]></title><description><![CDATA[Vroom is primarily an online used car retailer.

One of the most notable companies (both loved and hated by longs and shorts) is Carvana. There are a handful of used car retailers that focus on selling cars mainly through the internet. Carvana, Vroom, CarGurus, CarMax, and some others. All of these companies have slightly different strategies and I&#8217;ll be covering each of them over the course of the next month or two.</p><p><strong>Why does this opportunity exist?</strong></p><p>First, buying a new car is expensive and as soon as you drive it off the lot, the value of the car falls off a cliff. Some people are frugal and may prefer to buy a slightly used car and suffer through some potential headaches to save a couple grand. </p><p>Second, people generally don&#8217;t like car salesmen. The incentives are misaligned. Car salesmen want to sell you a vehicle that gives them the most commission. I&#8217;d argue most people don&#8217;t like to negotiate and further do not want to negotiate a car salesmen who negotiates for a living. Buying a used car online reduces the negotiating piece and consumers can compare prices across different websites.</p><p>Third, Amazon exists and is a household name. People like to buy things online from inside their homes. What if buying a car was that easy? This behavior won't change overnight, but COVID-19 sure did help. Most of these online retailers offer some guaranteed return policy where you can drive the car for a bit and return it if you don&#8217;t like it. This might be better than just a simple test drive at a dealership. I think it&#8217;ll take some time and honestly might never happen because cars are expensive and people want to see them in-person first, but the same could&#8217;ve been said for furniture, appliances, or other expensive purchases 5-10 years ago but look at where e-commerce has penetrated today.</p><h3>Business Overview</h3><p>Vroom sells used cars and offers additional products on top of selling used cars like financing, insurance, and other costs associated with selling a used car (see below for more). Vroom sources inventory from &#8220;auctions, consumers, rental car companies, OEMs and dealers.&#8221;</p><p>Vroom employs an asset-light/hybrid approach where it works with 3rd party companies for some of their operational areas. Vroom still has some of these operations in-house, hence the hybrid approach. Vroom works with partners for logistics, reconditioning facilities, customer financing, and customer support. From what I&#8217;ve read so far, this is a major difference between Vroom and other competitors like Carvana and CarMax.</p><p><strong>Why work with partners?</strong> Vroom believes it &#8220;provides flexibility, agility and speed as we scale our business, without taking on the unnecessary risk and capital investment inherent in direct investment.&#8221; I can see working with some partners as being beneficial but if these partners also need to make a profit on their relationship with Vroom, I worry how much those costs might pile up over time for customers.</p><p>More on the financials for Vroom, for the fiscal year of 2020, E-commerce, Wholesale and Texas Direct Auto (TDA) represented 67.4%, 18.1%, and 14.5% of revenue, respectively. Vroom purchased TDA in 2015 and serves as an in-person dealership.</p><p>The image below gives a good overview of Vroom&#8217;s revenue and gross profit calculation. Vehicle gross profit in 2020 is down ~50% from 2018 levels, but what has been the result of COVID-19 on this segment? I&#8217;ll touch on this more in the financials section as well.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F853eeb81-8c51-4495-b35a-a42d0ae78f5a_1926x788.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F853eeb81-8c51-4495-b35a-a42d0ae78f5a_1926x788.jpeg" width="1456" height="596" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/853eeb81-8c51-4495-b35a-a42d0ae78f5a_1926x788.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:596,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:114385,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F853eeb81-8c51-4495-b35a-a42d0ae78f5a_1926x788.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F853eeb81-8c51-4495-b35a-a42d0ae78f5a_1926x788.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F853eeb81-8c51-4495-b35a-a42d0ae78f5a_1926x788.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F853eeb81-8c51-4495-b35a-a42d0ae78f5a_1926x788.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">From Vroom&#8217;s 2020 10-K</figcaption></figure></div><p>Vroom is a much smaller company than Carvana or CarMax and therefore doesn&#8217;t benefit from scale as much as investors might like but that also means Vroom has more future growth potential.</p><h3>Total Addressable Market</h3><p>In Vroom&#8217;s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001580864/000119312520241003/d94166ds1.htm">S-1</a>, the used automotive market is the &#8220;largest consumer product category&#8221; with over $841 billion in sales from 40 million units in 2019. One of the most interesting aspects of the used car market is how fragmented it still is and how companies like Carvana and CarMax still represent such a tiny portion of the overall market. </p><p>There are lots of inefficiencies in trying to sell a car without using Vroom, CarMax, Carvana, or others. For smaller, cheaper, and less important products like a book, you can buy it from neighbors, go to a yard sale, or look online on places like Facebook Marketplace. Buying a book from a neighbor who might&#8217;ve had some white lies won&#8217;t be too damaging to your bank account. Books with a couple rips or smudges aren&#8217;t ruined and at most you&#8217;re losing $20.</p><p>Used cars are expensive, important, could be the difference between life or death (ok I might be exaggerating here but you get the point), and you need to trust the other party&#8217;s words in order to have faith in buying their vehicle. Buying an awful used car will cost you thousands or tens of thousands of dollars so you want to make sure you buy the right car from the right person.</p><p>Another interesting perspective I heard from a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6ayjINs27LKDJTJjnph7zF">podcast</a> is that what if Carvana, CarMax, and Vroom, can make the average consumer purchase a used car more often or reduce the friction of buying and selling used cars. This is a purely hypothetical example and I&#8217;m just trying to explain a point, but if the average person drives a car for 6 years before selling it, but the ease of use of buying and selling cars to these retailers makes the average person  more likely to trade the car in after only 5 years. This increases the number of used car units sold per years, and could dramatically improve the size of this market. I think this scenario is only upside and shouldn&#8217;t serve as the main thesis or even your bull thesis. </p><h3>Competitive Advantages</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Scale</strong></p><p>As Vroom is able to expand its infrastructure to support selling more cars, its margins should improve as fixed costs are spread over a larger base of units and profitability will likely (and hopefully) follow. Once Vroom has the infrastructure in place, competitors may be unable to compete on prices or the selection of cars because of scale advantages.</p></li><li><p><strong>Brand</strong></p><p>I think there&#8217;s a lot of trust that will need to be established over time. Used car retailers are trying to get rid of the slimy car salesman. I wonder how important branding will be to some of these competitors. </p><p>It seems to me that Amazon&#8217;s focus on customer service early in it&#8217;s life helped to make the switch from buying in-person to buying online so much easier. If Vroom or another competitor can build the trust necessary to make that switch from going to a dealership to buying a car online, then that brand will likely be vital to its success and its competitive advantages.</p><p>Word of mouth can also head spread a brand&#8217;s reputation since you won&#8217;t be buying a car on Vroom as often as you&#8217;d be buying toilet paper on Amazon.  </p></li></ul><h3>Financials</h3><p>I&#8217;ll primarily be focusing on the e-commerce business unit within Vroom when looking at the financials. I think e-commerce is the most attractive and interesting part of Vroom&#8217;s financial statements. I could list out every single line item that I find important or could be relevant but then this would take up the whole writeup. Also the product revenue has 100% gross margins.</p><h4>2020</h4><ul><li><p>E-commerce vehicle revenue = ~ 884.6 million</p></li><li><p>E-commerce vehicle gross profit = ~ 30.0 million </p></li><li><p>E-commerce product gross profit = ~ 30.9 million</p></li><li><p>E-commerce units sold = 34,488</p></li><li><p>E-commerce total gross profit per unit sold = ~ $1,765</p><ul><li><p>E-commerce vehicle gross profit per unit sold = ~ $869</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>E-commerce product gross profit per unit sold = ~ $896</p></li></ul></li><li><p><em>E-commerce revenue growth = 55.7%</em></p></li><li><p><em>E-commerce total gross profit margin = 6.6%</em></p></li><li><p><em>E-commerce vehicle gross profit margin = 3.4%</em></p></li></ul><h4>2019</h4><ul><li><p>E-commerce vehicle revenue = ~ 577.0 million</p></li><li><p>E-commerce vehicle gross profit = ~ 21.0 million </p></li><li><p>E-commerce product gross profit = ~ 11.1 million</p></li><li><p>E-commerce units sold = 18,945</p></li><li><p>E-commerce total gross profit per unit sold = ~ $1,696</p><ul><li><p>E-commerce vehicle gross profit per unit sold = ~ $1109</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>E-commerce product gross profit per unit sold = ~ $587</p></li></ul></li><li><p><em>E-commerce revenue growth = 95.3%</em></p></li><li><p><em>E-commerce total gross profit margin = 5.5%</em></p></li><li><p><em>E-commerce vehicle gross profit margin = 3.6%</em></p></li></ul><h4>2018</h4><ul><li><p>E-commerce vehicle revenue = ~ 295.4 million</p></li><li><p>E-commerce vehicle gross profit = ~ 16.7 million </p></li><li><p>E-commerce product gross profit = ~ 5.8 million</p></li><li><p>E-commerce units sold = 10,006</p></li><li><p>E-commerce total gross profit per unit sold = ~ $2,241</p><ul><li><p>E-commerce vehicle gross profit per unit sold = ~ $1,666</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>E-commerce product gross profit per unit sold = ~ $575</p></li></ul></li><li><p><em>E-commerce total gross profit margin = 7.4%</em></p></li><li><p><em>E-commerce vehicle gross profit margin = 5.6%</em></p></li></ul><p>While some of these metrics look terrible because it&#8217;s decreasing from 2018 through 2020, I think they need to be taken with some understanding that Vroom (like many other businesses) is investing for the future and is hoping to gain operational leverage once the scale and infrastructure is in place. Of course, if you don&#8217;t believe Vroom is a great business, then these metrics might support your case but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s as easy as black and white.</p><h3>What&#8217;s Interesting</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Tiny current market share?</strong></p><p>Like I touched on above, the e-commerce penetration in the used car industry is miniscule. Even if this industry never reaches more than 5% e-commerce penetration, that&#8217;s still a 5x increase from today. That&#8217;s easy to say but hard to do obviously but I think the potential could be there.</p><p>While I think there will always be some consumers who won&#8217;t ever be comfortable buying a used car online, there will be some consumers who are more comfortable buying a car online rather than in-person. There&#8217;s more negatives about buying a car in-person than there ever was about buying toilet paper at the local grocery store. I think if the friction of buying a car online continues to be reduced, more people will be attracted to using one of these companies. It&#8217;s up to the investor to determine which company (if any) to invest in.</p></li><li><p><strong>Somewhat counter-cyclical?</strong></p><p>Used car retailers aren&#8217;t totally recession proof but if you want exposure to the auto industry without a complete collapse when the economy isn&#8217;t doing too hot, then I think used car retailers could be an attractive investment. While on one end of the spectrum, buying and selling cars is a cyclical business, on the other end, buying and selling specifically used cars rather than new expensive cars will have much less of an impact due to a recession than the broader market. So maybe not entirely counter-cyclical, but somewhat counter-cyclical. </p><p>Most people would agree that cars are a necessity. During a recession or when the overall economy is suffering, people turn to cheaper options. One cheaper option during a recession is to buy a used car over a new car. In a perfect world without debt or unprofitable companies, used car retailers will suffer during a recession but will fare better off than dealerships or other businesses selling new cars through the recessionary period. Dealerships or other companies selling only new cares will suffer more than these used car retailers and won&#8217;t perform as well through the recessionary period but will have a greater return to normalcy than used car retailers once people have more spending money again.</p></li></ul><h3>Future Questions</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Asset-light versus asset-heavy?</strong></p><p>One of the big differences I&#8217;ve noticed from just my initial research this week is that Vroom talks a lot about it&#8217;s asset-light and hybrid infrastructure and business model, but Carvana seems to have a much more vertically integrated business. Each setup has its pros and cons, but is there a particular strategy that helps to win the major of this industry&#8217;s market share?</p><p>Do these differences lead to a profound impact on future margins? What about growth or competitive advantage? If Carvana has better infrastructure and more fixed costs that are hard to implement or copy, does that mean Vroom or other competitors can&#8217;t offer nearly as good of a deal as Carvana can?</p></li><li><p><strong>Market structure in 5 years?</strong> </p><p>Does this market remain fragmented in a couple of years with some of these online retailers only capturing a hundred basis points of market share or do these businesses grow large enough to capture a meaningful portion of market share in say 5-10 years. </p><p>Also does this market turn into a winner-take-all market? This industry is different from software industries, but Amazon has cornered a large portion of the e-commerce market because of the investments in infrastructure and the supply and demand is matched on Amazon. This isn&#8217;t a perfect apples to apples comparison or anything since Vroom isn&#8217;t a marketplace but rather a retailer. The investments in infrastructure though and being able to spread those costs over a large base of units may lead to a cost advantage for one or more of these companies. </p></li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>I&#8217;m not sure where I stand on Vroom and the rest of this industry. There are many investors who think some of these companies are a total fraud or wildly overvalued. This is my first week of working through the used car retail industry and I&#8217;m looking forward to learning more and getting some feedback.</p><p>The companies I have in this sector so far are:</p><ul><li><p>Carvana</p></li><li><p>AutoNation</p></li><li><p>CarGurus</p></li><li><p>Cars.com</p></li><li><p>Shift Technologies</p></li><li><p>CarMax</p></li><li><p>Auto1 Group</p></li></ul><p>If there are any companies I&#8217;m missing or that I should add to this list please comment below, DM me on Twitter, or send me an email at StratusYoung@gmail.com.
