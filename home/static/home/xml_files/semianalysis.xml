The iPhone is one of the best phones and the incredible silicon teams at Apple are much of the reasons why. Apple has consistently had the best CPU, GPU, video recording, and efficiency with every release. Many buyers of the iPhone may even argue that the massive yearly gains in the chipset are irrelevant because the iPhone is already well past the point of diminishing returns.</p><p>Ming Chi Kuo, the legendary Apple supply chain analyst, has dropped some major news for fruit phone lovers. The not-so successful iPhone Mini is dead and Apple is instead replacing it with an <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1503033674643939333?s=20&amp;t=hS6vNUMnR_o3JEXEkeMdfA">iPhone Max</a>. This would be a larger iPhone with a similar screen size as the flagship iPhone Pro Max. In addition, Kuo commented that the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Max would not receive the new A16 chipset that launches this year, but instead <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1503033974473760768">will receive the existing A15 chipset.</a> In addition, he stated the Pro models would receive 6GB of LPDDR5 instead of 6GB of LPDDR4X like the non-pro iPhones.</p><p>Moore&#8217;s law has slowed, especially in the economic sense. 2018 was Apple&#8217;s last major step down in cost per transistor due to TSMC&#8217;s N10 to N7 process node shrink. With the transition from N7 to N5, the cost benefits were relatively small due to <a href="https://semianalysis.com/apples-a14-packs-134-million-transistors-mm2-but-falls-far-short-of-tsmcs-density-claims/">SRAM scaling issues.</a> N7 is entering its 5th year of production, and N5 is now at its 3rd, yet the only hint of per wafer pricing changes have been in the wrong direction. Until now, Apple has already powered through <a href="https://semianalysis.com/apple-a14-die-annotation-and-analysis-terrifying-implications-for-the-industry/">the existing cost scaling</a> issues and maintained a transistor count CAGR of 30% for the last 3 years.</p><p>This all changes in 2022.</p><p><a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/tsmc-3nm-wafer-shipments-pushed-into">TSMC&#8217;s N3 has been delayed</a>. For the first time ever, Apple will have 3 generations on the same generation of process density. Apple is using TSMC&#8217;s N4 process node, which is only a meager 5% increase in density for pure logic scaling. TSMC reports N4 process node revenue under their &#8220;N5&#8221; node on financial statements because they are the same node family and even share the same fabs.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5b86cb9-de0e-44ad-833a-8a7dda2a3195_1023x467.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5b86cb9-de0e-44ad-833a-8a7dda2a3195_1023x467.png" width="1023" height="467" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f5b86cb9-de0e-44ad-833a-8a7dda2a3195_1023x467.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:467,&quot;width&quot;:1023,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5b86cb9-de0e-44ad-833a-8a7dda2a3195_1023x467.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5b86cb9-de0e-44ad-833a-8a7dda2a3195_1023x467.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5b86cb9-de0e-44ad-833a-8a7dda2a3195_1023x467.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5b86cb9-de0e-44ad-833a-8a7dda2a3195_1023x467.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Apple using the same node is completely unprecedented and means they have to face tough decisions. <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/apple-a15-die-shot-and-annotation">A15 was already a relatively chunky 107mm2.</a> Apple faced a tough choice of forcing their various IP teams under strict area budgets and influencing long term designs, or a large increase in cost of manufacturing. <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/apple-cpu-gains-grind-to-a-halt-and">While Apple&#8217;s CPU performance gains have slowed down</a>, they will be implementing a large core change this year. In addition, GPU, NPU, media blocks, and ISPs are also getting improved. To accommodate their new architecture, Apple is going to spend quite a few more transistors. This will likely bring transistor counts up to around ~19 billion, and die sizes to ~130mm2.</p><p>In addition, Apple will need to increase memory bandwidth for their SOC. They have been able to stay on LPDDR4x for 5 generations <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/apple-a15-die-shot-and-annotation">by increasing on die cache sizes and improving utilization.</a> With the A16, the step up to LPDDR5 brings a large cost increase.

This would result in more than a $40 increase in bill of materials (BOM). With numerous supply chain disruptions and cost increases for energy and commodities, it would be a difficult pill for Apple to also swallow the ballooning silicon costs as well. Apple could also increase prices, but that likely would eat into sales volumes.</p><p>It seems Apple has chosen the middle ground of keeping the same A15 chipset in the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Max and moving memory up from 4GB to 6GB. This likely allows Apple to maintain the iPhone 13&#8217;s $799 price point for the iPhone 14. The 14 Max would then slot in at $899 and the same specs. The iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max likely remain the same $999 and $1099 price points.</p><p>The bifurcation of iPhone SOCs is likely a trend that remains well into the future. Even when TSMC&#8217;s N3 is finally shipping <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/tsmc-3nm-wafer-shipments-pushed-into">in early 2023</a>, wafer cost will be well over $20k. Transistor cost scaling at N3 is non-existent and therefore this problem only continues. TSMC&#8217;s N5 yields are amazing, with D0 at around 0.07, so <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/advanced-packaging-part-1-pad-limited">chiplets with more advanced packaging</a> isn&#8217;t a solution. The world will have to live with these cost scaling issues <a href="https://www.fabricatedknowledge.com/p/the-rising-tide-of-semiconductor">by either eating the cost increases</a>, or slowing the growth of transistor counts.</p><p>Behind the subscriber only wall, we will discuss the orders Apple has put into fabs and memory producers as well as our take on wafer fabrication equipment outlook.

The needs for input and output of data are soaring as humanity generates and processes more data. Power per bit of data transferred is not falling at a similar rate to these IO increases.

These partnerships include 3 of 4 top photonics transceivers suppliers, 4 of 5 of the top networking firms, 3 of the 4 leading EDA and simulation firms, and some of the most promising photonics-based startups. Intel is the only major firm involved in photonics that is missing. They are using their own in-house platform.</p><p>Broadcom is the highest volume networking switch and photonics IC vendor in the world. They have some of the most promising research regarding co-packaged optics. Broadcom will likely be the highest volume firm shipping co-packaged optics in the 2024-2025 time frame. Intel is pushing in with their Tofino switches, but they are starting from a miniscule market share in networking switches while Broadcom ships the majority of high performance switches.</p><p>Cisco, via their acquisitions of Lightwire and Luxtera, is also a leader in silicon photonics for transceivers, switches, and general co-packaged optics. We believe they will have the 3rd highest volumes of co-packaged optical switches in the 2024&#8211;2025-time frame, after Broadcom and Intel. Currently Cisco use TSMC for some of their photonics needs, but this signals a big departure.</p><p>Cisco also has partnerships with Intel coming on manufacturing. It will be very interesting to see how this shakes out. The announcement from Cisco and GlobalFoundries covers both in datacenter and long-haul networking as well. The most interesting aspect of their announcement was that the partnership involved the development of a custom process development kit.</p><blockquote><p>GF also announced it is partnering with industry leader Cisco Systems, Inc., on a custom silicon photonics solution for DCN and DCI applications, including an interdependent Process Design Kit (PDK) in close collaboration with our GF manufacturing services team.</p></blockquote><p>Marvell is the leader in TIAs and DSPs that accompany all optical transceivers via the Inphi acquisition. They also have a treasure trove of other networking IP including Innovium Switch and Cavium/Avera/Aquantia Infrastructure IP. Due to their deep chest of networking IP and the semicustom design integration with hyperscalers, they likely will be developing co-packaged optical chiplets for hyperscalers such as Microsoft.</p><blockquote><p>Marvell continues to lead the industry with the highest performance transimpedance amplifiers and modulator drivers for next-generation optical connectivity solutions for the cloud data centers and carrier markets. GF&#8217;s latest silicon germanium (SiGe) technology enables us to achieve the high bandwidth speeds and power efficiencies that our customers require to meet their ever-increasing data demands.</p><p>Dr. Loi Nguyen, executive vice president, Optical and Copper Connectivity Group, Marvell</p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F953e2794-37c6-441b-91dc-a8b6b7dec7b9_1024x575.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F953e2794-37c6-441b-91dc-a8b6b7dec7b9_1024x575.png" width="1024" height="575" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/953e2794-37c6-441b-91dc-a8b6b7dec7b9_1024x575.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:575,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F953e2794-37c6-441b-91dc-a8b6b7dec7b9_1024x575.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F953e2794-37c6-441b-91dc-a8b6b7dec7b9_1024x575.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F953e2794-37c6-441b-91dc-a8b6b7dec7b9_1024x575.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F953e2794-37c6-441b-91dc-a8b6b7dec7b9_1024x575.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Nvidia is a top networking vendor due to their acquisition of Mellanox.

For reference, the most advanced datacenter 800G transceivers typically do 8x100Gbps fibers. GlobalFoundries is positioning themselves as the leader by being able to deliver 1.6 to 3.2Tbps optical chiplets. For reference, an Nvidia A100 GPU delivers 4.8Tbps of NVLink IO. If Nvidia doubles this rate as expected with their next generation Hopper GPU architecture, then it would need as many as 6 optical tiles. If GlobalFoundries research into 500Gbps fibers is realized to production, then they would only need 4 fibers coming out of each GPU, which could potentially be achieved with a single optical tile. While Hopper will be able to get away without co-packaged optical tiles, the generation after that will surely integrate this sort of technology.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa8b4930-6af3-46da-b2b7-a82be9e0e338_1024x512.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa8b4930-6af3-46da-b2b7-a82be9e0e338_1024x512.jpeg" width="1024" height="512" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/aa8b4930-6af3-46da-b2b7-a82be9e0e338_1024x512.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:512,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa8b4930-6af3-46da-b2b7-a82be9e0e338_1024x512.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa8b4930-6af3-46da-b2b7-a82be9e0e338_1024x512.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa8b4930-6af3-46da-b2b7-a82be9e0e338_1024x512.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa8b4930-6af3-46da-b2b7-a82be9e0e338_1024x512.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Ayar Labs is perhaps the most promising startup related to co-packaged optics. They have already shipped co-packaged optics with Intel FPGAs, and they continue to get more wins and traction. They currently manufacture with GlobalFoundries and seem to have no intention of leaving. GlobalFoundries has developed many of their key packaging technologies by using Ayar as a ramp partner. These include the copper pillar technology and v-groove fiber attach technology. Macom makes external lasers that are then coupled with this fiber off package. On die vs off package laser is an interesting debate, but GlobalFoundries supports both these technologies and has customers using both.</p><blockquote><p>Since our earliest days, Ayar Labs and GlobalFoundries have partnered on the development of GF Fotonix, from incorporating our PDK requirements and process optimizations to demonstrating the first working silicon on the platform. The combination of our leading monolithic electronic/photonic solution and GF Fotonix unlocks a tremendous market opportunity for chip-to-chip optical I/O and sets the stage for us to <strong>deliver substantial volume shipments by year end.</strong></p><p>Charles Wuischpard, CEO, Ayar Labs</p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F213de9d1-ecd8-416a-9447-afd31b31576a_1023x767.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F213de9d1-ecd8-416a-9447-afd31b31576a_1023x767.jpeg" width="1023" height="767" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/213de9d1-ecd8-416a-9447-afd31b31576a_1023x767.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:767,&quot;width&quot;:1023,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F213de9d1-ecd8-416a-9447-afd31b31576a_1023x767.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F213de9d1-ecd8-416a-9447-afd31b31576a_1023x767.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F213de9d1-ecd8-416a-9447-afd31b31576a_1023x767.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F213de9d1-ecd8-416a-9447-afd31b31576a_1023x767.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Ranovus is another co-packaged optics firm. They have partnered with AMD for co-packaged optics on FPGAs. This partnership could extend beyond, but it may also be similar to the Ayar and Intel collaboration where it is short lived. AMD lacks photonics IP, so this would be a natural long term partnership or acquisition target for them.</p><blockquote><p>We are delighted to share our multi-disciplinary silicon-photonics IP cores and chiplets, and advanced packaging solutions with our customers who are driving the adoption of novel data center architectures based on integrating best-in-class chiplets and co-packaged optics.

They are also working with GlobalFoundries. We doubt they will be manufacturing with GlobalFoundries, so it is likely more of a validation and testing relationship to integrate Macom&#8217;s external TIAs into the Fotonix ecosystem.

The processor is manufactured on the same TSMC 7nm node, and only contains some tweaks that enable hybrid bonding. End users will receive up to 40% performance benefit over the prior generation and up to 16% performance per watt benefit. Clock speeds were increased from 1.325GHz to 1.85GHz.

Graphcore emphasized there are no cost increases to end users. The lack of cost increases will be explained later in 3D packaging section. The 40% clock speed improvement translates to a 30% to 40% improvement in performance in their suite of workloads.

It is what enables the 40% clock speed improvement despite identical architecture and node at the same costs and improved power efficiency. A common issue with leading edge logic is the transient spikes. Smooth power delivery is critical and often the limiting factor preventing higher clock speeds. Graphcore demonstrated that by simply smoothing and improving power delivery, they can gain a huge clock speed increases without decreasing performance per watt.</p><p>Graphcore achieved this by implementing a large number of deep trench capacitors on a second wafer and using TSMC&#8217;s SoIC wafer-on-wafer hybrid bonding technology to integrate the two. Most designs include some deep trench capacitors on die or even on package, but this is the first instance of 3D hybrid bonding for them. These embedded deep trench capacitors are similar to those found in prior DRAM processes. The packaging innovations enable orders of magnitude more deep trench capacitor capacity than any other high performance leading edge chip has had in the past.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b5e9f7b-3ec8-41ac-9084-31328a18d6c2_640x608.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b5e9f7b-3ec8-41ac-9084-31328a18d6c2_640x608.png" width="640" height="608" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2b5e9f7b-3ec8-41ac-9084-31328a18d6c2_640x608.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:608,&quot;width&quot;:640,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b5e9f7b-3ec8-41ac-9084-31328a18d6c2_640x608.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b5e9f7b-3ec8-41ac-9084-31328a18d6c2_640x608.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b5e9f7b-3ec8-41ac-9084-31328a18d6c2_640x608.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b5e9f7b-3ec8-41ac-9084-31328a18d6c2_640x608.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>We mentioned this in <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/advanced-packaging-part-2-review">part two of our advanced packaging series,</a> but TSMC&#8217;s chip-on-wafer-on-substrate technology (CoWoS) first introduced this technology to 2.5D packaging several years ago. <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/advanced-packaging-part-3-intels">Intel&#8217;s Foveros also offers deep trench capacitors</a> on the base die.

The hybrid bonding process here is wafer-on-wafer rather than chip-on-wafer. This provides a huge benefit to density of packaging. AMD&#8217;s 3D V-Cache technology uses <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/advanced-packaging-part-2-review?s=w">TSMC&#8217;s chip-on-wafer bonding at a 17-micron pitch for TSV&#8217;s.</a> The wafer-on-wafer hybrid bonding technology is able to offer TSV&#8217;s at 1/10th the pitch. In other words, in the area that chip-on-wafer hybrid bonding is able to offer 100 TSVs, the wafer-on-wafer technology can offer 10,000.</p><p>In addition to improved density and therefore integration, the throughput of packaging is also increases sizably. Rather than having to pick up each polish, cut, clean, and place individual dies, wafer-on-wafer allows entire wafers to bonded at once. This greatly improves throughput and therefore costs. Any yield issues are solved architecting higher repairability of the design.</p><p><a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/advanced-packaging-part-1-pad-limited">Sony&#8217;s image sensors</a> and YMTC&#8217;s NAND also use wafer-on-wafer hybrid bonding technologies.

One containing a tweaked version of Graphcore&#8217;s previous MK2 chips, and another with the deep trench capacitors. The bonded pair is then grinded down all the way till the top wafer with the capacitors is 10 microns thick. The wafer with the logic provides structural rigidity. The bonded pair then has an ion etch process which etches down to the TSVs. The TSVs are then built through the second wafer on the order of ~1 micron pitch. While Graphcore isn&#8217;t using any transistors in the 2nd wafer, they indicated they will in the future.</p><p>The process for this type of wafer-on-wafer hybrid bonding is quite unique and therefore has a unique supply chain.

The contents of this hack that have already been released have major implications, but the threatened release on Friday would be a national security disaster.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fad7aa7e0-58b3-497e-a0ae-9903d5f2deb7_542x678.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fad7aa7e0-58b3-497e-a0ae-9903d5f2deb7_542x678.png" width="542" height="678" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ad7aa7e0-58b3-497e-a0ae-9903d5f2deb7_542x678.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:678,&quot;width&quot;:542,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fad7aa7e0-58b3-497e-a0ae-9903d5f2deb7_542x678.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fad7aa7e0-58b3-497e-a0ae-9903d5f2deb7_542x678.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fad7aa7e0-58b3-497e-a0ae-9903d5f2deb7_542x678.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fad7aa7e0-58b3-497e-a0ae-9903d5f2deb7_542x678.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>After the initial hack, Lapsus$ announced they had over 1TB of data.

A complete disaster.</p><p>Nvidia&#8217;s proprietary software is considered to be its edge over its competitors. Part of this includes the testers and simulator files. This shows how Nvidia simulates their chip design and weighs various architectural decisions. In short, this is a critical part of Nvidia&#8217;s proprietary design process, and it is now in the public domain. With this data, the multiple Chinese AI and GPU firms can kickstart and catch up massively on the design of their GPUs. Western competitors would not touch this with a 10 foot pole due to being illegal and unethical, but as shown by Huawei in the last two decades, many others will blatantly violate these norms.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d730d91-6b2f-4b18-989d-0804579d6be8_530x560.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d730d91-6b2f-4b18-989d-0804579d6be8_530x560.png" width="530" height="560" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7d730d91-6b2f-4b18-989d-0804579d6be8_530x560.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:560,&quot;width&quot;:530,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d730d91-6b2f-4b18-989d-0804579d6be8_530x560.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d730d91-6b2f-4b18-989d-0804579d6be8_530x560.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d730d91-6b2f-4b18-989d-0804579d6be8_530x560.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d730d91-6b2f-4b18-989d-0804579d6be8_530x560.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The group is now threatening to release a hardware folder that is 250GB. They allege this folder contains critical silicon design documents and code including the Verilog. With this access, there would be direct access to Nvidia&#8217;s design. In addition, they claim to have all details related to Nvidia&#8217;s Falcon control and security processor. Malicious semiconductor firms could look through these files, learn as much as possible and directly apply these learnings to their future products. They could go as far as reverse engineering the designs for SMIC&#8217;s 14nm process node. The only silver lining is that Verilog files may potentially be encrypted.</p><p>In the past, a malicious actor <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-stolen-gpu-ip-exclusive/">hacked AMD</a> and gained access to their Navi 21 GPU Verilog files. The hacker demanded $100 million, but they were not complete and gibberish. The level of access that Lapsus$ seems to have would make it plausible that they have access to the entire Verilog file in an unencrypted format. Semiconductor architecture designers and firms will likely have to deal with increased levels of IT security given the gravity of the Nvidia hack. Even intra-company sharing is likely to be impacted by new security practices that must be implemented in the wake of these security vulnerabilities.</p><p>The release of complete Verilog data would be a complete disaster for Nvidia and western national security. In essence, the blueprint of these chips, the product of a $580 billion company and $30 billion of research and development could be in the hands of hostile actors. The hacked data, which could have been sold to a nation-state actor, could very well prove the most strategically significant act of corporate espionage in a generation. With direct access to designs of the world's most advanced GPUs and AI processors, Chinese design firms could be able to dramatically increase the speed with which they catch up to their western competitors in all fields related to artificial intelligence and semiconductors. If, on the off chance that this data is not already in China's hands, the US Government should mobilize its cybersecurity arsenal to prevent PRC firms' ability to access this data.

SK Siltron, Siltronic, Global Wafers, Sumco, and Shin Etsu dominate the production of silicon wafers. There are also some operations in the US and Europe especially with specialty technologies such as silicon on insulator by the French firm, Soitec, and silicon carbide by the American firm Wolfspeed. Despite these specialty applications, more than 90% of raw wafers come from Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, and South Korea. From the very start of the life of a semiconductor, there is a deep supply chain concentration.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5b1cde4-8cc9-4bc2-96aa-a95a9726e4d2_908x1024.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5b1cde4-8cc9-4bc2-96aa-a95a9726e4d2_908x1024.png" width="908" height="1024" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b5b1cde4-8cc9-4bc2-96aa-a95a9726e4d2_908x1024.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:908,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5b1cde4-8cc9-4bc2-96aa-a95a9726e4d2_908x1024.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5b1cde4-8cc9-4bc2-96aa-a95a9726e4d2_908x1024.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5b1cde4-8cc9-4bc2-96aa-a95a9726e4d2_908x1024.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5b1cde4-8cc9-4bc2-96aa-a95a9726e4d2_908x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Lithography is often considered the single most important step within semiconductor manufacturing. While most people know how about ASML, the Dutch king of lithography, they do not realize the complete <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/lam-research-tokyo-electron-jsr-battle">Japanese monopoly in lithography</a>. Tokyo Electron has over 97% share in photoresist coaters and developers. Furthermore, they have 100% share on EUV photoresist coaters and developers. These are all manufactured in Japan. In addition, a trio of 3 Japanese firms, Shin Etsu, JSR and Tokyo Ohka Kogyo produce all advanced ArF and EUV photoresist. Despite lithography being seen as a European area of dominance, the reality is that ASML tools are useless without complementary Japanese tools and chemicals. This is a critical point of failure.</p><p>American firms such as Applied Material, Lam Research, KLA also have their own monopoly status within certain subsegments of semiconductor equipment related to deposition, etch, and lithography. Many would argue the dominance and concentration of semiconductor tools inside the US, Netherlands, and Japan is okay because these supply chains are embedded within democratic and liberal nations.</p><p>A big risk for the west is that the fabs themselves are at risk. More than 90% of DRAM and NAND is produced in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, China, and Singapore. All chips made on nodes with theoretical densities above 100 million transistors per square millimeters are made in Taiwan and South Korea. 4/5 of the largest foundries are headquartered and doing most of their manufacturing in Taiwan, South Korea, and China.

The supply chain issues are most worrisome in outsourced assembly and test (OSAT). More than 90% of this is done in East Asia and more than 60% of chip packaging volume is done in China. Even if chips are made in the west, they usually go to Asia for a critical step in the supply chain. Unlike the fabrication world where most tools still come from western companies, the outsourced assembly and test world has most their tools manufactured in East Asia as well. Kulicke and Soffa, Besi, ASMPacific, and SET do most if not all their tool manufacturing in China, Singapore, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Disco, the market leader in tools for grinding and cutting wafers into chips, is the only firm based in a western allied nation, Japan.</p><p>When we lasso the whole picture together, there is a severe lack of supply chain resilience. The top 10 foundries, TSMC, Samsung, GlobalFoundries, UMC, SMIC, Tower Semiconductor, Powerchip, VIS, Hua Hong Semi, and DB HiTek have their largest manufacturing locations in Asia. All of them are headquartered in Asia except for Global Foundries. All 3D NAND manufacturers, Samsung, SK Hynix, Western Digital, Kioxia, Micron, and YMTC have their high-volume manufacturing in East Asia (Micron has more than 80% in East Asia.) This same statement regarding 3D NAND also applies to DRAM manufactures. The vast majority of chip dicing, assembly, and testing is done in East Asia.</p><p>The semiconductor supply chain is global in terms of inputs and outputs, but the most fabs are not. The emergence of war between Russia and Ukraine combined with a weak western response has severely spooked investors with fears of a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan. TSMC was down more than 7% at its lowest the day after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, meanwhile, GlobalFoundries, the 3rd largest foundry in the world, ended the day up more than 14%.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F817227ec-1410-473f-a7d4-8c9d891a80e1_1023x528.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F817227ec-1410-473f-a7d4-8c9d891a80e1_1023x528.png" width="1023" height="528" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/817227ec-1410-473f-a7d4-8c9d891a80e1_1023x528.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:528,&quot;width&quot;:1023,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F817227ec-1410-473f-a7d4-8c9d891a80e1_1023x528.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F817227ec-1410-473f-a7d4-8c9d891a80e1_1023x528.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F817227ec-1410-473f-a7d4-8c9d891a80e1_1023x528.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F817227ec-1410-473f-a7d4-8c9d891a80e1_1023x528.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><blockquote><p>A bet on Intel is a hedge against geopolitical instability in the world. And government leaders are recognizing this how vital semiconductors have become to every aspect of the economy, every aspect of national security. The world has woken up. And both the chips and the COMPETES Act in the U.S. are now headed to conference process to finish and enable this $52 billion of incentive of fuel to drive the semiconductor industry. Just last week, the EU issued their Chips Act, which is moving quickly.</p></blockquote><p>Intel&#8217;s CEO, Pat Gelsinger has some fiery words to say on the topic, especially regarding bringing the US and Europe back to much higher market shares in semiconductor manufacturing. If (that&#8217;s a big if) Taiwan was invaded, more than likely there is some destruction at TSMC and UMC. At the very least, there will be a disruption. Western governments and Japan would presumably ban all tool exports to China and captured Taiwan. In this doomsday scenario, there would be a large amount of money being thrown at firms who manufacture semiconductors outside of China and Taiwan. Taiwan and <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/fears-for-chinese-semiconductor-capital">China</a> have little to no progress in the way of semiconductor capital equipment manufacturing.</p><p>A huge race to move semiconductor manufacturing away from Taiwan is possible due to the lack of access to semiconductor capital equipment. Even if the fabs were not damaged, tools begin to break down, critical chemicals such as photoresist would not be supplied, and the massive fabs in Taiwan would grind to a halt. In this theoretical Taiwan invasion scenario, firms such as Intel, Samsung, GlobalFoundries, Texas Instruments, STMicroelectronics, Micron, NXP and Infineon would need to start building a lot more capacity to satisfy all the capacity that was been taken off the market by a war. Oddly based on the market&#8217;s movement, the Wall Street isn&#8217;t fully recognizing what a potential war means for equipment vendors, only the &#8220;western&#8221; fabs such as GlobalFoundries and Intel.</p><p>As semiconductor shortages continue to flare across the world and geopolitical instability rises, governments look to regionalize semiconductor supply chains. Even without a potential war, Korea has some huge incentives and national initiatives in place, and Japan has recently passed some new incentives for local semiconductor manufacturing into law. The US and EU look like they will do so soon as well. The playing field must be leveled to match incentives that Taiwan and especially China have enshrined in law. The proposed European and American semiconductor investments do not level the playing field, but they do start to chip away at China&#8217;s more than $250B in semiconductor subsidies. The proposed regionalization of fabs has massive implications for the supply chain.</p><p>The first implication from regionalization is there will be a movement towards smaller fabs away from larger giga-fabs. A giga-fab is one that has a monthly production capacity more than 100,000 wafers per month. We can see this already with TSMC&#8217;s current investments in Japan, US, and China. These fabs are smaller than their giga-fabs in Taiwan and likely that means they are less efficient. Larger fabs are run more efficiently than many small fabs due to the nature of the incredibly complicated multivariate calculus that involves tool positions, cycle times, throughput per tool, variance in time between tools, the wafer highway that transports wafers across the fab, and much more. A larger fab is better able to balance these factors and therefore extract more throughput out of each tool. These multiple small fabs could have just as many tools, but their output would be lower. Regionalization has a direct impact on the capital intensity of a fab (a measure of revenue versus spending on building the fab).</p><p>The second implication is that less efficient operators would be rewarded. Integrated design manufactures such as Intel, Samsung, Texas Instruments, STMicroelectronics, Infineon, and NXP are generally considered to be less efficient at getting wafers through the fab and maximizing utilization of their tools versus foundries. Capital intensity will continue to rise across the industry due to this. Intel states they will run at <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/intel-is-throwing-the-kitchen-sink?utm_source=url">a long term capital intensity of ~30% with the net capital intensity being 25%</a>.

This is increasing the capital intensity of semiconductor manufacturing. Regionalization causes more smaller fabs, which increases the capital intensity of semiconductor manufacturing. The rewarding of less efficient players such as Intel, Samsung, and more with subsidies increases the capital intensity of semiconductor manufacturing. In short, it is a great time to be a wafer fabrication equipment producer. Behind the subscription wall, we will mention our favorite stocks that are beneficiaries of this new paradigm of semiconductor localization.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/i-semiconductor-the-regionalization?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/i-semiconductor-the-regionalization?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p>

They have also historically undergrown the titans of the industry such as Applied Materials, Lam Research, ASML, Tokyo Electron, and KLA. On a first glance would say you should ignore this company and that they are a relic of the past that continues to lose market share, but their future is far more interesting with a large new facility in San Jose and an array of products serving growing segments. Is Veeco pulling an amazing turn around?</p><p>Veeco historically was heavily involved in the worst two businesses for a supplier. Their ion beam deposition and etch tools are critical for hard drives heads and metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) for LEDs. The hard drive business is a good business, but it&#8217;s quite cyclical. Moreso than even front-end semiconductor equipment. The LED business has been plagued by lower margins due to high competition from China.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b921963-e4d4-4001-841c-0fcd7530308c_1024x576.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b921963-e4d4-4001-841c-0fcd7530308c_1024x576.png" width="1024" height="576" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9b921963-e4d4-4001-841c-0fcd7530308c_1024x576.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:576,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b921963-e4d4-4001-841c-0fcd7530308c_1024x576.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b921963-e4d4-4001-841c-0fcd7530308c_1024x576.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b921963-e4d4-4001-841c-0fcd7530308c_1024x576.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b921963-e4d4-4001-841c-0fcd7530308c_1024x576.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>In 2017, Veeco acquired Ultratech and in 2018 they exited the commodity LED business.

One is via more magnetic heads needing to be manufactured and the other is via heads becoming more complicated. As multi actuator hard drives become more common and the typical hard drive contains more platters. There is a magnetic head for every platter and therefore the number of heads expands. Furthermore, as platter density is increased, the complexity of the heads also increases. The hard drive business is still cyclical, but it&#8217;s also more clearly a growth market.</p><p>Veeco&#8217;s other traditional market of MOCVD for LEDs has gone through a tumultuous time. Aixtron is the largest firm operating in the MOCVD, but Veeco outcompeted them in the LED market causing Aixtron to refocus on other MOCVD markets such as lasers, power, and RF. This left Veeco dominating the market for MOCVD related to LEDs. At their height, Veeco had over 50% of their sales coming from China, with most of these being epitaxial tools for the LED market. This success was very short lived as China entered the market.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff1238a5d-d84e-4ff9-b741-3f8fc19fe680_1024x572.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff1238a5d-d84e-4ff9-b741-3f8fc19fe680_1024x572.png" width="1024" height="572" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f1238a5d-d84e-4ff9-b741-3f8fc19fe680_1024x572.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:572,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff1238a5d-d84e-4ff9-b741-3f8fc19fe680_1024x572.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff1238a5d-d84e-4ff9-b741-3f8fc19fe680_1024x572.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff1238a5d-d84e-4ff9-b741-3f8fc19fe680_1024x572.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff1238a5d-d84e-4ff9-b741-3f8fc19fe680_1024x572.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>AMEC, a Chinese semiconductor capital equipment firm entered the field and quickly took share in LED. AMEC would have issues shipping those MOCVD tools outside of China due to IP issues (hint hint). AMEC through a combination of subsidies, low R&amp;D overhead, and selling tools at cost, quickly came to dominate the market. This caused Veeco to exit the market.</p><p>During this exit period, they dropped from ~30% of the epi market to 12%. Their main competitor, Aixtron, went from ~30% to ~40% share during the same period. Quite the divergence. Going forward, the MOCVD share losses have stabilized and may even reverse.

MicroLED is the holy grail of display technology, it&#8217;s just a matter of whether it becomes cost effective to scale.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e171d69-f125-4e85-ad2d-ee62defbd160_1024x570.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e171d69-f125-4e85-ad2d-ee62defbd160_1024x570.png" width="1024" height="570" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8e171d69-f125-4e85-ad2d-ee62defbd160_1024x570.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:570,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e171d69-f125-4e85-ad2d-ee62defbd160_1024x570.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e171d69-f125-4e85-ad2d-ee62defbd160_1024x570.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e171d69-f125-4e85-ad2d-ee62defbd160_1024x570.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e171d69-f125-4e85-ad2d-ee62defbd160_1024x570.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The much larger opportunity in the short term is the power and RF market. Veeco is the leader in GaN deposition which is heavily utilized in certain RF processes and in power. Aixtron has larger share within this space, particularly because more GaN processes currently are 150mm wafers, but Veeco is better positioned for the future due to their much higher share in 200mm wafer systems. 200mm wafer systems will start to become a much larger portion of GaN on Si and GaN on SiC wafers as new power and RF applications ramp. These tools are also selling the photonics market and have recorded large wins there.</p><p>Veeco offers a wet processing system that is doing very well in the RF semi market. They are winning big sales here as well. It is a big driver of their compound semi business unit. This wet processing systems is used for metal lift off and wafer cleaning. The wet processing is also used in the fabrication of HBM memory. For wafer cleaning and metal lift off between DRAM layer stacks.

TSMC, ASE, Samsung, and Intel have purchased lithography tools from Veeco. Veeco is a holds 50%-60% share and this segment is booming. The lithography tool comes from their acquisition of Ultratech. It is used to pattern copper pillars and TSVs. The tool is not as precise as those from Nikon or ASML, but it is higher throughput and therefore it has better TCO. Processes such as Foveros, InFO, CoWoS FoCoS, HBM, FOSiP, and more can utilize this tool. <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/advanced-packaging-part-2-review?utm_source=url">Check out this article for a deep dive on the various advanced packaging types.</a> Veeco&#8217;s lithography unit has quite the growth opportunity.</p><p>Another very promising growth vector is Veeco&#8217;s EUV mask deposition group. Veeco has a complete monopoly on ion deposition tools which sell into this field. EUV masks function very differently from normal masks in that they are reflective. Instead of shining light through a mask and then exposing a wafer, an EUV tool bounces light off a mirror which also happens to be the mask.

Pat Gelsinger shined through of course with his animated and excited mannerisms. It&#8217;s undoubtable he has caused a culture change. From completely reorganizing the business units, to hiring over 17,000 employees in 1 year, to increasing stock based compensation for critical design and fab employees. Moral is much higher now at Intel.</p><blockquote><p>First, we're rebuilding that (Andy) Grovian execution as we call it, bringing back that heart of Andy Grove, the confidence, the engineering centricity, the discipline, the competitive spirit.</p></blockquote><p>The only reason we here at SemiAnalysis will even entertain the thought of a technical turn around is because there is a clear culture shift at the firm. We will get more into technical in a bit which are not quite as optimistic in our critical view, but let&#8217;s talk about this culture shift.</p><blockquote><p>Well, we've made some fundamental changes. And if you heard from (Dr.) Ann (Kelleher) this morning session, we've leaped forward with our embrace of EUV. We've built deep partnerships. <strong>We used to tell the equipment vendors, drop it on the shipping dock and we'll take care of it from there.</strong></p></blockquote><p>This is a very critical point that should not be underestimated. In the past, Intel&#8217;s fabs had a toxic culture due to people such as Sohail Ahmed and Brian Krzanich. The fabs thought they were kings and would do whatever they pleased. For a long time, that made sense, they were by far better than any other team on the planet. The fab teams were so pompous they would even ignore the equipment vendors.</p><p>A real example of this is with Intel&#8217;s 10nm node. One (of many) problems with Intel&#8217;s 10nm was related to their use of cobalt within vias and interconnects. To cut a long and technical story short, the seed deposition and annealing was not ready yet. This would cause massive issues. Applied Materials had told Intel it wasn&#8217;t fully ready for the limelight, yet Intel continued to push ahead despite the warnings. Of course we know how the story goes, it took years and years before the yield properly yielded and was able to ramp. Dr. Randhir Thakur who used to be a general manager of the semiconductor business at Applied Materials is now a leader of Intel&#8217;s foundry services and supply chain. There is a much deeper respect for Intel&#8217;s suppliers.</p><blockquote><p>Now we're deeply partnering with them. And in particular<strong>, the ASML relationship is superb</strong>. We rebuilt the leadership team.</p></blockquote><p>One underrated aspect of the current turnaround is with tool suppliers. In the 2010s, tool vendors did not like Intel that much. They thought they were smarter than you. They told you what to do. These same tool vendors wanted the bleeding edge to not be a 1 man show.</p><p>Up until the mid-2010s, it was only Intel on the leading edge, with everyone a few years behind. Intel is now a couple years behind TSMC, but they can leverage learnings from tool vendors to ramp much more rapidly. The tool vendors understand where their tools are being used, how they are used. Working closely with tool vendors is incredibly important.</p><p>Intel&#8217;s relationship with ASML for example is a huge benefit. ASML is helping Intel learn how to ramp EUV, they are shipping them a lot of EUV tools to multiple fabs, and they are even giving intel the first production High NA EUV tool. This preferential treatment is also being given by other tool vendors by Intel. We can also see somewhat similar treatment being given to Samsung on their upcoming gate all around process, which we will detail in a future article.

And those of you who might talk to industry and equipment vendors, they will resonate.</strong> This is a new Intel, <strong>more open, engaged, and proactive </strong>than ever before.</p></blockquote><p>We can validate this statement. More on the industry standard design tools and PDKs in the section about Tower Semiconductor. It&#8217;s an important, necessary, and crucial move to throw out the antiquated and slow internal tools and adopt something far more efficient and leaner. Adopting all this technology doesn&#8217;t make it surefire that Intel catches up, just to be clear.</p><blockquote><p>We reinvested. I whipped out my checkbook and onetime Andy Grove said to me, I thought I gave you an unlimited budget, and you still overspent it. <strong>Well, to some degree, we've given (Dr.) Ann (Kelleher) an unlimited budget, and we said, get us on track</strong>, and we've invested heavily in the equipment and the engineering to go do that.</p></blockquote><p>Intel&#8217;s components research and long-term development teams which are responsible for path finding and process node development have had a massive increase in resources. In addition, they have access to the most advanced tools from all semiconductor tool vendors. They have been given more personnel and pay with a much better management structure. The organizational structure, especially within the long-term development branch, is a shift to be aware of. More on this in the &#8220;Nodes&#8221; section.</p><p>Auguste Philip Richard asked a fantastic question related to personnel hires. If you keep track of LinkedIn engineer flows like us, you will see tons of amazing engineers coming to Intel, from all over the ecosystem. Whether it was Intel&#8217;s competitors, suppliers, customers, cloud players, Apple, everywhere.</p><blockquote><p>Simple question. Pat, you've hired some great people, and they don't look money-motivated. What's the sales pitch? How are you getting these people on the door? Is it just the mission impossible? Any color there would be really helpful.</p><p>As I commented, we are in a mission. There's almost an irrational commitment to this commitment of <strong>Intel as this foundational technology company for Silicon Valley, for the industry, for the world</strong>. And this team that we're assembling , I'd like to call it my 5-year team, right, where we are kumbaya, coming together, because we are going on mission together to <strong>restore the most iconic company in the industry</strong> to deliver against just an extraordinary set of opportunities in front of us to launch new disruptive businesses for the future, and that's a journey that is unleashing incredible energy of the 120,000 people we have inside of the company but this leadership team as well as seeing that opportunity and that passion.</p><p>Now when you translate that, hey, we got to take care of our people, right? <strong>We got to compensate them well, but great talent shows up because they believe in the mission.</strong> And then they say, <strong>I want to work on the hardest problems.</strong> And then <strong>I want to work with the best people</strong>, and <strong>I want to have a culture and an environment that I want to be part of.</strong> And then, oh, yes, I want to be compensated as well. But it's in that order. And what we are assembling is a team that believes in this mission that Intel is the company that can deliver technologies that improve the lives of every single person in the planet. That's the mission that we're on, and we have a unique set of assets to accomplish it.</p></blockquote><p>This is a bit of the CEO talking his book but talk to some folks who have returned to Intel. There are quite a few people who quite literally think Intel needs to be restored or &#8220;The West&#8221; loses all hardware technology advantage it has. We agree with these folks to a certain extent.</p><blockquote><p>We've rolled them out across the organization. We've rebuilt our decision-making processes. <strong>We brought back OKRs, objectives and key results.</strong> Why do we stop doing that? We invented it. Everybody else in the Valley embraced it, and we stopped doing it, we are doing it again. <strong>We've tied every person in the company and part of their financial rewards is based on their OKRs, and their individual execution against them.</strong> <strong>The culture is being rebuilt</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>Another gargantuan change is the shift back to OKRs. We won&#8217;t dive too far into what OKR is, but it is an important framework to track goals and outcomes. It keeps people responsible, and was invented by Andy Grove. Brian Krzanich was responsible for removing them and moving to other performance metrics. Moving back to OKRs should help keep people responsible, accountable, and performance reviews be more fair.</p><blockquote><p>When I came back to the company, <strong>we were losing talent.</strong> And many of you were writing on that, the <strong>brain drain</strong>. Well, that&#8217;s changed. And we now have <strong>brains coming back</strong>. We've hired 17,000 technical employees in '21, many joining from key competitors saying, "Wow, that's pretty cool. Let's -- let me go join them what they're working on.&#8221; Many of them are returnees who are coming back and saying Intel is back, and I want to be part of that. The band is coming back together and the mojo is back. What Intel is known for this powerful culture of discipline, innovation and execution, and I call it the Grovian culture that we want.</p></blockquote><h1><strong>Intel Process Technology</strong></h1><p>The biggest and most monumental task in Intel&#8217;s turn around is process technology. The Intel 7 to Intel 4 ramp is roughly 2 years behind TSMC and their N7 to N5 process node ramp. As mentioned earlier, Intel gets to have a period of catchup where they aren&#8217;t inventing the wheel. This should allow Intel 4 and Intel 3 to be smoother ramps.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb149a966-38c5-437b-af5d-0ce0aee7fbc6_1024x533.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb149a966-38c5-437b-af5d-0ce0aee7fbc6_1024x533.png" width="1024" height="533" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b149a966-38c5-437b-af5d-0ce0aee7fbc6_1024x533.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:533,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb149a966-38c5-437b-af5d-0ce0aee7fbc6_1024x533.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb149a966-38c5-437b-af5d-0ce0aee7fbc6_1024x533.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb149a966-38c5-437b-af5d-0ce0aee7fbc6_1024x533.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb149a966-38c5-437b-af5d-0ce0aee7fbc6_1024x533.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Intel 20A is where the real test is. Intel has to deliver huge changes such as RibbonFET and PowerVia, two features that are not in volume production yet anywhere in the industry. To achieve this goal, they have introduced a new modular design architecture. They are dubbing it Tick-Tock. It appears the major front end transistor pitch scaling comes with the tick node and the tock involves optimization and further enhancements to that base.</p><p>Intel is simplifying the process flows for development and carefully considering the multivariate problem of innovation vs execution vs predictability. The tick tock model enables more independence into different segments of the process development pipeline which can be monitored and managed without impacting entire process. For example, different teams can work on signal, power delivery, and the transistor separately. The delineation and these breaks are called process modules. Each team has higher levels of accountability and this also increases the rate of learning as different features can potentially be pulled in or out.</p><p>The example Intel is offering is with PowerVia, or what the industry calls backside power delivery network. Today, across all foundries, power and signal layers are contained in a single interconnect stack. PowerVia pulls out all the power delivery and puts it on the flip side of the wafer, which enables the signal interconnects and power interconnects to be more highly optimized for the task at hand.</p><p>Intel has a custom version of their Intel 3 process node where they are testing the process flow of building the transistor layer, building the signal interconnects, temporary bonding to a carrier wafer, then flipping the wafer, revealing nano TSVs, and creating the power delivery network. This module of the process can be fully tested and debugged independently of the change in transistor architecture, RibbonFET. Active risk assessments and contingencies are in place for these high-risk process changes to ensure a delay in a module does not cause a delay for the entire process node.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1cb2161-32b0-49ac-abce-9f46a7e7ab50_1024x532.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1cb2161-32b0-49ac-abce-9f46a7e7ab50_1024x532.png" width="1024" height="532" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a1cb2161-32b0-49ac-abce-9f46a7e7ab50_1024x532.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:532,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1cb2161-32b0-49ac-abce-9f46a7e7ab50_1024x532.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1cb2161-32b0-49ac-abce-9f46a7e7ab50_1024x532.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1cb2161-32b0-49ac-abce-9f46a7e7ab50_1024x532.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1cb2161-32b0-49ac-abce-9f46a7e7ab50_1024x532.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Only the tock nodes are being offered within the foundry service model. Just like TSMC ramps their newest nodes such as N5 with Apple before other customers hop on, it seems Intel will do internal designs on their tick node. TSMC often has much larger waves of customers on their TSMC N5P and N4 type nodes, and this same logic applies to Intel&#8217;s tocks where their foundry customers are offered the more complete tock nodes. This is another level of de-risking for foundry customers as they will know Intel de-risked most of the node internally a year before they ramp.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e871d6c-ec41-4c1b-bc57-b69c7adae6b8_1024x539.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e871d6c-ec41-4c1b-bc57-b69c7adae6b8_1024x539.png" width="1024" height="539" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4e871d6c-ec41-4c1b-bc57-b69c7adae6b8_1024x539.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:539,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e871d6c-ec41-4c1b-bc57-b69c7adae6b8_1024x539.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e871d6c-ec41-4c1b-bc57-b69c7adae6b8_1024x539.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e871d6c-ec41-4c1b-bc57-b69c7adae6b8_1024x539.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e871d6c-ec41-4c1b-bc57-b69c7adae6b8_1024x539.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Intel is ramping multiple products on Intel 4 including Meteor Lake and a custom ASIC for networking.

The old model of ramping a major node, then transferring most the tools to the next node was not efficient. Intel specifically mentioned with the 14nm to 10nm node transition, 90% of tools were transferable. This means 10% of the tools had to be sold as the old node ramped down. Furthermore, Intel would have to do further engineering to ensure their old tools could transfer.</p><p>In many cases, a new tool version would be released which was better suited for the task at hand, but instead of purchasing that new tool, Intel would engineer the process around the old tool. In the model of copy-exact, where the same tool and process is used across all sites in a ramp, Intel orders more of the old tool which may not be as efficient per dollar spent. We talk more about the topic in <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/is-intel-shipping-tools-out-of-us">this article from last month.</a></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba6260f8-f976-48b1-bc8a-b2ea2826f2ec_1024x565.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba6260f8-f976-48b1-bc8a-b2ea2826f2ec_1024x565.png" width="1024" height="565" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ba6260f8-f976-48b1-bc8a-b2ea2826f2ec_1024x565.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:565,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba6260f8-f976-48b1-bc8a-b2ea2826f2ec_1024x565.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba6260f8-f976-48b1-bc8a-b2ea2826f2ec_1024x565.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba6260f8-f976-48b1-bc8a-b2ea2826f2ec_1024x565.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba6260f8-f976-48b1-bc8a-b2ea2826f2ec_1024x565.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>In addition to the capital efficiency benefits from keeping old nodes ramped, Intel benefits by having consistently high wafer starts. In semiconductor manufacturing, utilization rates are king. A perfect example is GlobalFoundries, who <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/globalfoundries-gfs-ipo-mubadala">Mubadala lost over $22.4B on</a> over the course of a decade. They were plagued with low utilization rates, and now they are running at 100% utilization rates and will do so for the next few years. This single change has propelled them to becoming a profitable company and a worthwhile investment.</p><p>Intel needs the scale from a foundry business to keep pursuing the next nodes. They are large enough that the next few node transitions can be bankrolled, but eventually TSMC&#8217;s size and volumes will continue to grow, and the development costs of the bleeding edge will become too expensive to realize.</p><p>Intel&#8217;s entrance into foundry is not just diversification, but also one of necessity. The integrated design manufacture model cannot continue to forever. Intel needs to spend a lot of money to start down the path of a foundry. One of the avenues is by building more fabs. Intel says these new fabs will be paid for partially through their existing business, more debt, selling a small portion of Mobileye, government grants, and customer prepayments.</p><p>Intel also mentioned the possibility of partnering and signed MOR with Brookfield Asset Management for funding the construction of fabs. Brookfield Asset Management is an international real estate and private equity firm. They are heavily involved in many different businesses, but we believe this partnership would be designed to take advantage of investors who have pushed down rates for infrastructure and real estate lease backs to very low levels. Many firms build a headquarters, only to sell it to a company like Brookfield Asset Management and lease it back for the long term. We can certainly envision a plan where Intel builds a fab shell and sells it to Brookfield along side the terms for a multi-decade lease.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43e1bfd8-9c5a-45ad-9390-70e75db559b8_1024x554.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43e1bfd8-9c5a-45ad-9390-70e75db559b8_1024x554.png" width="1024" height="554" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/43e1bfd8-9c5a-45ad-9390-70e75db559b8_1024x554.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:554,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43e1bfd8-9c5a-45ad-9390-70e75db559b8_1024x554.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43e1bfd8-9c5a-45ad-9390-70e75db559b8_1024x554.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43e1bfd8-9c5a-45ad-9390-70e75db559b8_1024x554.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43e1bfd8-9c5a-45ad-9390-70e75db559b8_1024x554.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Intel&#8217;s spending is heavily heard towards technology development in 2022 relative to other years. 2022 and 2023 will include a large buildout of fab shells. These fab shells would have the option of sitting empty until needed so Intel can be more flexible in ramping capacity.

Capital intensity is up and that is great for firms such as Applied Materials, ASML, Lam Research, KLA, Tokyo Electron, Onto, Nova, Entegris, etc.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72da144c-92d8-4e81-99f4-74406f1dafa8_1024x565.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72da144c-92d8-4e81-99f4-74406f1dafa8_1024x565.png" width="1024" height="565" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/72da144c-92d8-4e81-99f4-74406f1dafa8_1024x565.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:565,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72da144c-92d8-4e81-99f4-74406f1dafa8_1024x565.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72da144c-92d8-4e81-99f4-74406f1dafa8_1024x565.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72da144c-92d8-4e81-99f4-74406f1dafa8_1024x565.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72da144c-92d8-4e81-99f4-74406f1dafa8_1024x565.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Intel specifically mentioned that these capital expenditure numbers are net. This means that if Intel can offset the spending via government grants and subsidies, the potential partnership with Brookfield Asset Management, and customer prepayments, their spending will only go up. Intel is conservatively penning in 10% for these offsets, but they could end up much higher if the US and EU finally recognize that they will fall completely behind in hard technology without semiconductor subsidies to match those already in place within the tax code and government budgets of countries in Asia.</p><p>Intel is talking a big game in their foundry ambitions, but SemiAnalysis has had many questions related to their entry here. Acquiring a foundry was necessary to accelerate Intel Foundry Services.</p><p>We were big believers of the strategy involved with the rumored acquisition for GlobalFoundries. Our sources indicate Intel did indeed make an offer, and Mubadala indeed turned it down due to issues with regulators and timing. Customers would not be happy with the level of information disclosure Intel would get, and the acquisition would have likely taken 18 months if it was even able to secure regulatory approval. In 18 months, the GlobalFoundries turn around would be well underway and it would be worth a good bit more than the Intel offer.</p><p>With this acquisition falling through, Intel had to turn their head to another foundry. After GlobalFoundries, UMC is the next largest, but Tawian wouldn&#8217;t allow it. SMIC is 5th and the same applies there with China. Moving down the list, Powerchip, Vanguard International Semiconductor, and Hua Hong all have these same issues. The only foundry left with reasonable volume and size was Tower Semiconductor based out of Israel.</p><h1><strong>Tower Semiconductor</strong></h1><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b093bba-9b84-456c-898f-56f824ff3f42_1023x554.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b093bba-9b84-456c-898f-56f824ff3f42_1023x554.png" width="1023" height="554" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1b093bba-9b84-456c-898f-56f824ff3f42_1023x554.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:554,&quot;width&quot;:1023,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b093bba-9b84-456c-898f-56f824ff3f42_1023x554.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b093bba-9b84-456c-898f-56f824ff3f42_1023x554.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b093bba-9b84-456c-898f-56f824ff3f42_1023x554.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b093bba-9b84-456c-898f-56f824ff3f42_1023x554.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The acquisition of Tower Semiconductor plugs much needed gaps in Intel's foundry offerings for process nodes beyond leading edge FinFET. Tower Semiconductor gives them teams who have been profitably running specialty technologies that interface with multiple external clients in a successful manner. Intel's biggest hole in the foundry arena is the lack of capabilities in the creation and maintenance of simple yet flexible Process Design Kit (PDK). Old Intel utilized mostly flows that were very custom tailored to their internal needs which increased development time for chip designs. This is a non-starter in the foundry business. As Intel tries to adopt more industry standard flows, PDK capabilities are an area they need a lot of help with. Towers capabilities in specialty niche technologies really boost their ability to create and offer flexible and extensible PDKs.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94174de9-f98f-4fa0-ab06-574e7c6200ee_1024x408.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94174de9-f98f-4fa0-ab06-574e7c6200ee_1024x408.png" width="1024" height="408" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/94174de9-f98f-4fa0-ab06-574e7c6200ee_1024x408.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:408,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94174de9-f98f-4fa0-ab06-574e7c6200ee_1024x408.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94174de9-f98f-4fa0-ab06-574e7c6200ee_1024x408.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94174de9-f98f-4fa0-ab06-574e7c6200ee_1024x408.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94174de9-f98f-4fa0-ab06-574e7c6200ee_1024x408.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Tower Semiconductor offers a wide array of technology from RF CMOS, SiGe power ICs, discrete devices, CMOS image sensors, photonics, RFID, bipolar CMOS (BiCMOS), silicon-on-insulator (SOI), LDMOS transistors, MEMS, wafer bonding, Y-Flash memristors, and high-performance analog. Panasonic is Tower&#8217;s largest customer, but they have many other customers. Below is our breakdown of the technologies offered by Tower.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Silicon Photonics</strong> &#8211; Tower utilizes their SiGe BiCMOS process for integrating optical components in the datacenter communication market. The platform includes the integration of photodetectors, optical modulators, and lasers into a single die.</p></li><li><p><strong>RF CMOS</strong> &#8211; Used in highly integrated transceivers, power amplifiers, and tuners. Integrated inductors, variable capacitors, and laterally diffused MOS transistors are all fabbed on a single die.</p></li><li><p><strong>Silicon on Insulator (SOI)</strong> &#8211; Tower fabs antenna switches and front-end modules, commonly found in smartphones.</p></li><li><p><strong>BiCMOS for RF</strong> &#8211; Similar to RF CMOS but more features, mostly sells into specialized trancievers and tuners. Can incorporate high-speed bipolar transistors. The equipment needs here are more specialized.</p></li><li><p><strong>SiGe BiCMOS &amp; Analog</strong> &#8211; Even more features than the standard BiCMOS, suited for even more advanced RF. It&#8217;s targeted at high performance analog semiconductors for high-speed, low noise, highly integrated multi-band wireless transceivers, optical networking components, automotive radars, hard drive pre-amplifiers, power amplifiers, and low noise amplifiers. Incorporates silicon germanium bipolar transistors which offers much higher performance. This process involved deep collaboration with a semiconductor capital equipment provider and is unique to Tower. They are the highest volume user of SiGe. We wonder if the engineers from Tower can assist Intel on their implementation of a SiGe channel on future leading-edge nodes.</p></li><li><p><strong>CMOS Image Sensors and Wafer Stacking</strong> &#8211; Tower Semi CMOS image sensors are often found in Nikon cameras, but they also exist in many other high-end applications such automotive sensors and smartphones. They offer 2 main process nodes for image sensors, 110nm on 200mm wafers and 65nm on 300mm wafers with pixel sizes down to 1.12-micron. Tower is capable of dual light pipe, rolling shutter, and global shutter. Tower Semiconductor also offers backside illumination, a form of 3D eafer stacking where a digital CMOS wafer is stacked under a thinned image sensor wafer.</p></li><li><p><strong>X-Ray and Reticle Stitching</strong> &#8211; For x-ray, Tower developed the capability to offer reticle stitching so chips can extend beyond the size of a lithography reticle. This technology is offered on the 0.18-micron node and the 65nm nodes. The x-ray chips sell into dental, CARM, angiography, mammography, and industrial non-destructive test. The x-ray sensors produced can be as large as 1 die for an entire 300mm wafer.</p></li><li><p><strong>Other Sensors</strong> &#8211; Tower also can manufacture Infra-Red sensors for gesture recognition and spectral sensitivity sensors. They also offer indirect and direct time of flight 3D sensors for VR, AR, and smartphones. These sensors can also be used for facial recognition. Single photon avalanche diodes and LiDAR are also manufactured by Tower.</p></li><li><p><strong>MEMS</strong> &#8211; Tower has high share within the MEMS microphone arena which is used everywhere from wireless earbuds to phones to industrial applications.</p></li><li><p><strong>Micro-LED &amp; Micro-OLED</strong> &#8211; Tower&#8217;s capabilities with reticle stitching also enable them to be an emerging supplier in Micro-LED for monolithic arrays in micro-OLED and LCOS displays. They are also engaged in GaN nano-tube based LEDs which can then be placed onto a backplane. This is an opportunity that Tower specifically called out as requiring more investment to scale up. We are hopeful Intel continues to invest in Tower&#8217;s Micro-LED technology.</p></li><li><p><strong>Power Management ICs</strong> &#8211; offerings include low voltage BCD and high boltage. For low voltage, BCD is a technical advantage and includes 5V, 8V, 12V, 40V, and 60V devices for power and drive semiconductors such as voltage regulators, battery chargers, power management products, and audio amplifiers. For high-voltage, 140V Resurf, 200V SOI, and 700V technologies are offered for gat drivers for discrete high-power transistors in automotive, industrial, AC adaptors, and lighting markets.</p></li><li><p><strong>Non-Volatile Memory </strong>&#8211; Tower developed a non volatile memory solution called Y-Flash. This can be integrated in power management products where other forms of memory will fall apart due to the strenuous conditions.</p></li></ul><p>The acquisition of Tower enables Intel to offer a more complete array of technologies with which they can leverage their scale to deliver. Tower needs Intel for help with scaling their fabs for the capability to supply large verticals such as battery management systems in electric vehicles and silicon photonics. Intel gets to hit the ground with existing relationships with foundry customers and leverage those to create further engagements in Intel Foundry Services.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04974cba-0acd-4f68-a89a-db0a66e4a040_1024x569.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04974cba-0acd-4f68-a89a-db0a66e4a040_1024x569.png" width="1024" height="569" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/04974cba-0acd-4f68-a89a-db0a66e4a040_1024x569.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:569,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04974cba-0acd-4f68-a89a-db0a66e4a040_1024x569.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04974cba-0acd-4f68-a89a-db0a66e4a040_1024x569.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04974cba-0acd-4f68-a89a-db0a66e4a040_1024x569.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04974cba-0acd-4f68-a89a-db0a66e4a040_1024x569.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Tower Semi and Intel together will be focused on the segments of compute, mobile, and automotive.

Overall, Intel didn't do their due diligence with this purchase and it shows.</p><h1><strong>Network and Edge</strong></h1><p>This is by far the most promising business unit within Intel and the most likely to hit and exceed its revenue targets. It has by far the best competitive outlook on hardware, the most advanced use of external foundries and internal foundries where applicable including TSMC N7 for DPUs (IPUs) and Intel 4 for custom networking ASICs, and the most well-maintained software suites which rearchitect how networks are managed.. Intel&#8217;s network and edge has also most closely worked with customers for co-developed hardware platforms. Fixed function hardware is being replaced to a software programable model while also maintaining fixed function hardware where it makes sense.

They will gain share and be a huge winner on the edge. Nick McKeown is a rockstar who has had many successful companies in products in this industry. His most recent effort that was purchased by Intel, Barefoot, is ahead of its time by offering programable switches and being the first switch with co-packaged optics. We expect Intel to start eating networking switch share rapidly in the &gt;100Tbps switch era. Pat Gelsinger seems to indicate he had to woo him to lead the group, and it&#8217;s a blessing for Intel that they have him.</p><h1><strong>Accelerated Computing and Graphics</strong></h1><p>While we are super optimistic on the network and edge group, we are not optimistic at all on AXG. They have to build a massive software suite, and while OneAPI has already surpassed AMD&#8217;s GPU software, it&#8217;s nowhere close to Nvidia&#8217;s. The Xeon products with HBM are only useful in very small niches. The GPU IP has a long way to go and fighting both Nvidia and AMD is going to be really difficult. Furthermore, Intel is using external nodes for their gaming GPUs, so they cannot use the IDM advantage to compete on cost either. Their worse architecture will show through directly to die sizes and BOM.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1888914e-aa7d-48db-8ac1-3ff54f30601b_1024x593.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1888914e-aa7d-48db-8ac1-3ff54f30601b_1024x593.png" width="1024" height="593" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1888914e-aa7d-48db-8ac1-3ff54f30601b_1024x593.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:593,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1888914e-aa7d-48db-8ac1-3ff54f30601b_1024x593.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1888914e-aa7d-48db-8ac1-3ff54f30601b_1024x593.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1888914e-aa7d-48db-8ac1-3ff54f30601b_1024x593.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1888914e-aa7d-48db-8ac1-3ff54f30601b_1024x593.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>It doesn&#8217;t help that Intel&#8217;s slide were somewhat deceptive.

For the first generation of discrete GPUs, Intel could potentially be switching to the super market model where they do not get paid until the ODM sells the laptop or GPU through to the end user or channel. This would be pretty smart because then Intel can stuff the channel with their inferior GPUs, and ODMs take no risk on their balance sheet if they do not sell. They would even be incentivized to sell Intel GPUs due to the amazing return on invested capital that they get.</p><p>We respect Raja Koduri, the leader of Intel&#8217;s AXG, but he has a very difficult path ahead of him on executing here. He was handed the worst iGPU architecture in the industry including comparing against Nvidia, AMD, Arm, Imagination, Qualcomm, and Apple. He was then asked to make magic out of it. Eventually we hope Intel&#8217;s AXG gets up to snuff, but we see no reason for AXG to be able to hit $10B of revenue in 2026, even with $1B of intra-company licensing revenue.</p><p>The only positives here are the AV1 encoding GPU and blockchain accelerator which look really nice. We aren&#8217;t crypto people, but we do track performance, network sizes, hashing power, and semi demand closely. The custom design services could be successful, but there&#8217;s a massive question mark here about what sort of semicustom deals could sit here.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91edb70b-6229-41b8-8189-d1cf672ff0f4_1024x546.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91edb70b-6229-41b8-8189-d1cf672ff0f4_1024x546.png" width="1024" height="546" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/91edb70b-6229-41b8-8189-d1cf672ff0f4_1024x546.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:546,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91edb70b-6229-41b8-8189-d1cf672ff0f4_1024x546.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91edb70b-6229-41b8-8189-d1cf672ff0f4_1024x546.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91edb70b-6229-41b8-8189-d1cf672ff0f4_1024x546.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91edb70b-6229-41b8-8189-d1cf672ff0f4_1024x546.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Falcon Shores is an interesting and ambitious product, which combines GPU and CPU on the same carrier, but it will be later than Nvidia&#8217;s Grace Hopper and AMD&#8217;s next generation HPC processor.</p><h1><strong>Client</strong></h1><p>And it goes from bad to worse here.

In this post, we will cover TSMC January results, Amazon, GlobalFoundries, Ford, Kulicke and Soffa Industries, FormFactor, Texas Instruments, Power Integrations, Sumco, GlobalWafers, Ichor, Skyworks, Qorvo, Qualcomm, Murata, Rambus, and Renesas.</p><p><strong>TSMC January</strong> <strong>Results</strong></p><p>TSMC crushed it and was well above estimates with January coming in 10.8% above December and 35.8% year over year. Their guidance was 5.5% to 9.3%, so TSMC is already looking like they will beat their awesome Q1 guide on a revenue basis.</p><p><strong>Amazon</strong></p><p>If 75% of Amazon&#8217;s infrastructure spending is for AWS, then capital intensity is 35%... Wow</p><blockquote><p>So when you look at those numbers and how they've grown over the last few years, I'll give you the proportions, which I'm not sure we've initially shown before is about 40% -- just under 40% of that CapEx is going into infrastructure, most of it's feeding AWS, but also certainly, Amazon is a large customer of that as well as we build infrastructure for ourselves directly or through AWS.</p></blockquote><p>Amazon keeps increasing the number of years to depreciate their servers. Means the depreciation costs for servers is spread over more years. Capital intensity is going up in that case despite all of Amazon&#8217;s efforts to increase their capital efficiency such as <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/amazon-graviton-3-uses-chiplets-and">in house CPUs</a>, <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/amazon-graviton-3-uses-chiplets-and">Nitro networking cards</a>, AI accelerators, and <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/amazon-graviton-3-uses-chiplets-and">in house SSD controllers</a>.</p><blockquote><p>We are increasing the useful life for servers from 4 years to 5 years and network equipment from 5 years to 6 years. As a result, our first quarter guidance includes an approximate $1 billion of lower depreciation expense.</p></blockquote><p>Total capex at $35.0 billion in 2020, $55.4 billion in 2021, and 2022 is going up without a doubt.</p><blockquote><p>Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2020 was $11.6billion, of which $9.3 billion was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021 and our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2021 was $14.0billion</p><p>For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $80.4 billion as of December 31, 2021. The weighted average remaining life of our long-term contracts is 3.8 years.</p></blockquote><p>That backlog!</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p><strong>GlobalFoundries</strong></p><p>To start off with the big guns, GFS beat, raised, and guided capex to be up more than 2x year over year!</p><p>The $4.5B capex guide is pretty wild! They are spending more than 2/3&#8217;s their 2021 revenue on 2022 capex. This is entirely funded by prepayments. GlobalFoundries says that the long term for capital spending as a capital as percentage of sales is 20%.</p><blockquote><p>All of our expansion investments are backed with customer long-term capacity reservation agreements and significant prepayments. Further, the majority of this expansion investment is in support of single-source business.</p></blockquote><p>The single sourcing of business is a major point. We wrote up GlobalFoundries technology moats in the past, but they are really starting to come to fruition across RF SOI, specialty CMOS processes, FDX, SiGe BiCMOS, GaN on Si, and&nbsp;<a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/globalfoundries-is-a-leading-edge">Silicon Photonics</a>.

Along side these terms, they also expect for ASPs to rise 10% year over year in 2022 versus 2021. The industry is structurally higher cost due to changes like these being inked in for the long term across many parts of the supply chain.</p><blockquote><p>In addition, we established ourselves as the industry leader in silicon photonics. Our monolithic and hybrid solution garnered over $500 million in new design wins in the year. And silicon photonics revenue almost tripled in 2021 and we expect it to more than double again in 2022.</p></blockquote><p>While most of this expansion is not related to silicon photonics, it is one area that we like to keep informing people about.</p><p><strong>Ford</strong></p><p>This quote is amazing</p><blockquote><p>Thank you for your question. Perhaps the biggest gift for all the pain we're going through now in semiconductors is that we have very painfully learned the lesson that we cannot manage the supply chain for these key components as we have. In fact, you could argue that in the change of transition to these digital electric vehicles that supply chain could be one of the biggest advantages a particular company has or doesn't have.</p><p>The way we look at it is the key electric components, memory chips, semiconductors. I would break semiconductors into 2 types. I'll come back with GlobalFoundries in a second. Feature-rich chips that we still use a lot. A window regulator doesn't need to have a 4-nanometer chip. And the advance -- but we also have sensors, power electronics for our inverters, the batteries themselves all the way back to the mine, the inverters of different battery. Chemistries itself have different raw materials and kind of ecosystems that support them. So this is a very important topic for the company.</p><p>How different it is? It's really different. We need different talent at the company. We need physical inspection of the actual producers. We need direct contracts with them. We need to design the SoC ourselves. We need to direct in the case -- in some cases, to even direct prefer build to print or actually use supplier XYZ to get out of where we've been. And this takes talent. It takes a different approach. It takes more resources.</p><p>On GlobalFoundries, it's kind of the first big bet, but there'll be many, many more coming for us. We're very dependent on TSMC for our feature-rich nodes. Obviously, the capacity is at risk over time as the industry moves to more advanced nodes, including us. And as I said, we're going to need feature-rich nodes for many years to come. GlobalFoundries knows how to build them. They know to build them in the United States. We can partner with the government, depending on the CHIPS Act to capacitize here. It will be a few years until we benefit from that, but it's a really big thing to descale ourselves on the feature-rich chips from the current ecosystem that we depend on around the world. And I think GlobalFoundries is a really interesting deal when we get into the details.</p><p>We have to put cash up when we participate. Those feature-rich semis will be used by other companies, industrial companies, not just Ford. It's a really interesting deal. And I was talking to the U.S. company. You can expect the same kind of thing on advanced nodes and all the other components I mentioned, including more deals on the raw material for various types of battery chemistry. And this is a culture change at Ford. As I said, this is part of the rhythm change between ICE and BEV.</p></blockquote><p>Did the auto company that fared the worst from shortages just pivot the hardest towards semiconductors? Some of it is empty signaling because of how poorly Ford has been doing under current shortages, but some of it is also a culture shift at the firm.</p><p>Did you guys notice the Ford and GlobalFoundries deal is non-binding?</p><p>In other words, completely PR!</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p><strong>Kulicke and Soffa Industries</strong></p><p>We were a bit bearish on the order book <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/semiconductor-roundup-212022">last post</a>, and for good reason.

This quarter is good progress on that number. Gross margins and operating margins crept up despite a slightly smaller revenue number, which shows operationally, they are digesting the huge growth well. Our $7 EPS contemplates the massive ~24% of market cap that is sitting in cash and short-term investments. We expected $400M of this would be deployed for buybacks in Q2 and Q3, but that isn&#8217;t the case. It is looking more like $300M will be used, with most coming in Q3 and Q4.</p><p>The traditional wire bonder orders do shrink in 2022, but <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/advanced-packaging-part-3-intels">the incoming business from TCB for Intel&#8217;s co-packaged optics</a>, battery and automotive, and miniLED will make up for the slack. With<br>And because we are so humble, here is the response to our question from the earnings call about the relationship between front end and back-end spending.</p><blockquote><p>Semi unit growth was around 20% in calendar year '21. So front-end investment continue to flood through front end. Yes, that's true. But normally, I think it will take a year, sometimes 2 years, depending on what kind of technology and investment scale to reach.</p><p>For example, investment from 2 years ago in China are expected to support wafer capacity growth in the second half calendar year, right? So I don't know if I answer your question. So normally, I think it takes up probably -- it can take up to 2 years.</p></blockquote><p>None of the 2021 or 2022 front end capex has flowed through to backend orders. We are still bullish once we get through this air pocket. The stock probably doesn&#8217;t do too much until we get through Q2.</p><p>I also asked about the battery business. This is one that I am very bullish on KLIC about. With the over $30B in battery facilities for EVs announced, the pack construction is an incredible opportunity.</p><blockquote><p>Q: For a follow-up, I wanted to ask a bit more about the battery business. At the Investor Day, you talked about a laser-based cylindrical bonder system, but we didn't really get much information beyond that. There's a lot of competition in the heavy wire bonder space for automotive. But what is this laser system? What is the advantage here? What does that do for competition?</p><p>Okay. So historically, I think we live in the heavy wire wedge space within automotive, right? But right now, actually, we have a battery solution, 2 for cylindrical and 1 for prismatic. So let me get into a right point why people think about laser compared to wedge. I think laser has a much faster process. The laser, the cost of ownership is low. But it hasn't demonstrated high-volume production capability yet.</p><p>One of the biggest issue, I think the process window tends to be narrow. And if a process window shift a little bit it can lead to some reliability concern, right? But some people actually -- I don't even know the term, pack assembly. So nobody, I think these days people use for -- tend to -- try to use a pack assembly, and it does provide an alternative process for some customers.</p></blockquote><p>Fusen isn&#8217;t a native English speaker, and he is clearly more of a technical guy, so don&#8217;t fault the transcription service I used here too much. The point is they have heavy bonders for cylindrical and prismatic battery cells as well as a new laser system for automotive. We believe the customer for this new system is LG. Tesla by the way, has been a top 10 customer for KLIC as well.

Technologically, we believe they are better than Navitas Semiconductor. They have better share, more efficient ICs, and better relationships through the industry. They are the highest volume company in GaN. While many other players are in the consumer GaN world, we believe that POWI is most likely to be able to extend it up to the industrial side.</p><blockquote><p>Our unique foundry model and timely investments in capacity, which enabled us to win market share in 2021, will help us again in 2022 as lead times remain stretched across the industry.</p></blockquote><p>Our own numbers agree with this statement in the subsectors they operate in. Don&#8217;t underestimate their quality. A bit expensive, but paying up for quality is a reasonable strategy for long term performance.</p><blockquote><p>We expect to double our addressable market to more than $8 billion over the next 5 years with the expansion primarily coming from the appliance, industrial and automotive markets.</p></blockquote><p>Their commentary on automotive wins is huge. We haven&#8217;t been able to confirm where the SiC IC is fabbed, but we believe it is at XFAB. The important bit is how POWI is using their module level expertise and sales/support channels to score wins.</p><blockquote><p>This latest InnoSwitch device designed for next-generation 800-volt EV platforms, incorporates a 1,700-volt silicon carbide MOSFET. The challenges of high voltage are new to the automotive market and customers are eager to tap our expertise. As noted earlier, we have multiple automotive design wins going into production later this year, including an emergency power supply for a Tier 1 automotive supplier. We have additional designs scheduled for production in 2023 and 2024, and a strong pipeline of design activity involving 7 of the world's top 11 automakers.</p></blockquote><p>Debt free, great cash generation, and a sound capital allocation policy.</p><blockquote><p>We took advantage of market volatility, including the turbulence around our promotion to the S&amp;P MidCap Index to buy back 2% of our outstanding shares between November and January.</p></blockquote><p>This one is a bit worrying though.</p><blockquote><p>Our unique foundry model and our investments in back-end capacity have enabled us to build inventories back to 114 days at year-end, up 15 days from the prior quarter and within sight of our target level of 125 days.</p></blockquote><p>15% YoY growth combined with inventory growth is a bit scary. It is somewhat understandable though because they sold down a ton of inventory in Q4 2020. Still, not exactly confidence inspiring. The guide is for 4% YoY growth, so expect that inventory to continue to build to the target level of 125 days. This guide has some China impact in it, but we aren&#8217;t making excuses for POWI.</p><p>We might even suggest to some to put a short on it, but the company is really good, and will reaccelerate in the second half, so you could very likely would get burned.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p><strong>Sumco and GlobalWafers</strong></p><p>Sumco is completely booked for 4 years. Just nuts!</p><blockquote><p>Demand for 300 mm wafers for both logic and memory use is expected to continue growing, with the entire volume including the increases from new facilities to be covered by long term contracts through fiscal 2026.</p></blockquote><p>GlobalWafers likewise, failed in their $5B buyout of Siltronic. As a result, they just announced plans to spend $3.6B on new capacity, with $2 billion for a new plant slated to open in 2024 and $1.6B to upgrade existing plants.</p><p>This chart from Sumco is amazing. Inventories for logic and memory are crunching, and turnover for existing raw wafer supplies is falling. The difference in logic inventories is much larger. Unfortunately the lack of Y axis prevents us from knowing what days of inventory are like, but some fabs could start hitting bumps for capacity of raw wafers. This trend doesn&#8217;t sound like it will reverse anytime soon. Easy to see why the major fabs of the world rushed to buy up all the capacity and likely are doing the same with GlobalWafers.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcadd9777-7526-4058-83ca-906a41fef917_1024x723.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcadd9777-7526-4058-83ca-906a41fef917_1024x723.png" width="1024" height="723" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cadd9777-7526-4058-83ca-906a41fef917_1024x723.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:723,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcadd9777-7526-4058-83ca-906a41fef917_1024x723.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcadd9777-7526-4058-83ca-906a41fef917_1024x723.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcadd9777-7526-4058-83ca-906a41fef917_1024x723.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcadd9777-7526-4058-83ca-906a41fef917_1024x723.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Sumco had some very interesting charts for projections into the future aswell.

There is also a take we have on Rambus and Renesas as well. Even if you aren&#8217;t interested in any of these firms, it would be great if you could support us! We will be getting back to the deeper dives on the technology with upcoming articles on Hybrid Bonding, Masks, and Silicon Carbide. They should be deeper than anything else out there publicly available and take a lot of time to research and write.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/semiconductor-roundup-2102022?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/semiconductor-roundup-2102022?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p>

These are almost required reading because the most interesting parts of these roundup posts are what you can read through about other firms in the supply chain that sometimes are seemingly even unrelated. Some themes in the previous post will continue on, but others will not. In this post, we cover Google, NXPI, Kulicke and Soffa Industries, Cirrus Logic, Entegris, AMD, SK Hynix, Rohm, and Fabrinet.</p><p><strong>Google</strong></p><blockquote><p>Turning to CapEx. The results in the fourth quarter primarily reflect ongoing investment in our technical infrastructure, most notably in servers, to support ongoing growth in both Google Services and Google Cloud. We also increased the pace of investment in fit-outs and ground-up construction of office facilities.</p><p>In 2022, we expect a meaningful increase in CapEx. In technical infrastructure, servers will again be the largest driver of spend.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFr74zI1LBM">I don&#8217;t need to say anything, only link this.</a></p><p>2022 is shaping up to be a +25% datacenter spend year across hyperscaler and enterprise, with hyperscalers leading the charge. This spend will incrementally mostly go to AI and networking.</p><p><strong>NXP Semiconductors</strong></p><p>This is one that I think sell side has completely wrong. There&#8217;s a couple sell/downgrade ratings even from terrific analysts such as Stacy Rasgon. NXP isn't big into the power semi and battery world, but they are embedded in so many other applications and usecases. The beat was strong, guidance was terrific.</p><blockquote><p>We anticipate 2022 will be another year of demand/supply imbalance with lead times extending out across almost the entire portfolio and the level and intensity of supply-related escalation conversations with our customers remains elevated.</p><p>Q1, very clearly, and I just want to be very explicit here relative to the guidance, this is completely kept by available supply, so much more demand than what we have in terms of supply.</p></blockquote><p>Don&#8217;t know how one can get more bullish than this.</p><p><strong>Kulicke and Soffa Industries</strong></p><p>Earnings is later this week, but I am pessimistic. There&#8217;s a triple whammy here. Let&#8217;s not forget the CEO sold a lotta stock recently&#8230;</p><ol><li><p>China lockdown. Lam Research and KLA have had huge issues getting deliveries to China, part of that is pushing revenue out to the next quarter.</p></li><li><p>KLIC order terms are not favorable. Because where they sit in the supply chain and their customers, they have worse terms for orders and deliveries. LAM and KLA can recognize revenue at shipment or delivery, KLIC almost always recognizes revenue at delivery. Any hiccup here hurts hard. The China issues will push on KLIC far harder, so I expect this issue to be exacerbated here vs the front-end semi-cap.</p></li><li><p>Wire bond temporary saturation. There are over 10 OSATs with &gt;$100M revenue, so it is hard to judge the market, but looking at the 3 largest, ASE, Amkor, and JCET, they are scaled back wire bond orders significantly in Q4. ASM Pacific, the number 2 in wire bonding, also expects a slowdown of wire bond orders in Q4. KLIC trades on the order book right now, for a variety the of reasons, investors do not care about the cash on hand or buyback story. Investor don&#8217;t care about miniLED, <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/advanced-packaging-part-3-intels">TCB for photonics</a>, or the battery business. We do expect wire bonding orders to reaccelerate at some point this year because capacity is not anywhere close to ready for the flood of trailing edge semi coming online, but for current fabs, we have plenty of capacity at Tier 1 OSATs and Tier 2&#8217;s/3&#8217;s are somewhat overbuilt.</p></li></ol><p>That said, the stock is very cheap so movement expectations from earnings are a crapshoot.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p><strong>Cirrus Logic</strong></p><p>Heavy Apple supplier here and they crushed earnings as expected with the strong Apple beat and business there. It&#8217;s very seasonal, but the beat is a pull in. Note they are not guiding a June quarter. Everything probably equalizes in the end. Such is life for Apple suppliers.</p><blockquote><p>So in fact, when we look at the March quarter, it doesn't look like a typical seasonal quarter &#8211; seasonal step down from December to March. It looks very strong. We're actually pulling material into the current quarter, wherever we can, in order to try to meet customer demand.</p></blockquote><p>Interesting read through on Apple supply chain. Was part of STMicro&#8217;s beat/guide also a pull in of Apple orders? They didn&#8217;t say it, but could be.</p><p><strong>Entegris</strong></p><p>Crushed it on earnings and outlook. They don&#8217;t have as many supply chain issues as many others. Entegris is mostly leveraged to wafer volume, but they do have a bit more leverage to shell capacity as well. This contrasts with traditional semicap names which are based on actual tool spend. As shells get built out with Samsung, TSMC, Intel, and many others not having much empty clean room space, they will benefit heavily. Wafer volume is going to only go up from here. Any down cycle would involve too much capacity coming online, and folks undercutting each other to maximize utilization for equipment they already bought. They should continue to grow revenue at slightly above wafer volume.</p><p><strong>AMD</strong></p><p>They beat yet again. Fairly boring quarter. The important things to note are that they are guiding nonGAAP gross 51% for 2022 vs Intel&#8217;s is indicative of 51%-53% for the year with 52% in Q1. When you stack on the Xilinx acquisition, this means they will surpass Intel on gross margin.</p><p>Q1 guide is $5B while year guide is $21.5B, so the typical seasonality and growth just isn&#8217;t there. AMD is completely sandbagging in my opinion. AMD will significantly beat on the 51% gross margin guide when you look at the shift in mix and price increases, they are forcing through on datacenter. They probably exit the year at 54% gross margins.</p><p>AMD paid down $1B prepayments this quarter, versus the over $3B that Nvidia did with more on the way. AMD also did $756M of buybacks in Q4. Kinda wish they didn&#8217;t do those and just threw that money all at more supply, because they will sell everything they make anyways. On the other hand, year to date, AMD has done $1B of buybacks, and those are likely working wonders as the stock cratered for factor reasons and now is coming back up to where it should be.</p><p>AMD will beat their year guide, by how much is contingent on supply. With continued N7/6 ramp and ramping up to 20k WPM of N5 next year as well, there is sizable room for beats in my opinion. Remember they guided 35% for 2021 and we got 68%.</p><p>AMD is trading kinda&#8230;. cheap. Then again, I am saying $5.1 EPS which is way above consensus by nearly a full dollar. That number is pre-Xilinx dilution. Xilinx is dilutive, and by a lot. I continue to say it, but I hate that deal&#8230;. Lisa Su gets a free pass to do whatever she wants, she clearly is much smarter than any of us.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p><strong>SKHynix</strong></p><p>Love SKHynix calls because they tell you all the numbers with node transitions and sub-segments. It&#8217;s great!</p><p>SKHynix continues to gain share in NAND. I have to imagine their long-term plan is to surpass Samsung in NAND market share. I would be flabbergasted if Samsung allowed that. A big spree of capex probably gets announced by Samsung in March.</p><p>An interesting conundrum in the background of this report is SKHynix 1A DRAM transition. They cannot ramp their China fab with this node due to 1A inserting EUV and export licenses for EUV tools to China having not been granted yet.</p><p>SK Hynix is in the same camp as Intel and AMD in that PC sales are flat year over year with mix getting much better due to Chromebook falling off the face of the planet and enterprise/gaming increasing. More interestingly, SK Hynix expects mobile to grow at mid-single digits. I can&#8217;t say I agree. I am more bearish on mobile units than SK Hynix is. Content will go up, sure, but they even mentioned the weakness in low end and midrange&#8230;</p><blockquote><p>Overall, DRAM demand growth is expected to be in the 18% this year and we are aiming for the company's bit shipment growth to be in line with market growth. However, demand may soften in the first quarter due to seasonality, and we plan to respond more flexibly in light of our lower inventory level. Accordingly, the company's DRAM bit shipment in the first quarter is planned to decrease by mid to high single-digit Q-o-Q.</p></blockquote><p>SK Hynix will grow their inventory levels in order to soften the impact of the weakness in the DRAM market. Samsung and Micron likely do the same and this should equalize pricing.</p><blockquote><p>NAND demand growth this year is expected to be about 30% and the company is planning for bit shipment growth that outpaces demand growth again for the year. This is based on our existing NAND business, and when Solidigm's volume is included, bit shipment growth is expected to almost double compared to last year.</p></blockquote><p>Prices for NAND continue to fall. They didn&#8217;t give a number, but based on our research it should be roughly in line with cost decreases as 70% of bit output transitions to 176 layer. NAND is a healthy market.</p><blockquote><p>On the other hand, equipment spending is planned to be similar to last year and will remain below the annual depreciation</p></blockquote><p>Makes sense with DRAM market under tight oligopolistic control and everyone having very low capex node transition from 128 layer to 176</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf30e38e-0661-45a3-b718-275ba0000293_1024x706.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf30e38e-0661-45a3-b718-275ba0000293_1024x706.jpeg" width="1024" height="706" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/af30e38e-0661-45a3-b718-275ba0000293_1024x706.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:706,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf30e38e-0661-45a3-b718-275ba0000293_1024x706.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf30e38e-0661-45a3-b718-275ba0000293_1024x706.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf30e38e-0661-45a3-b718-275ba0000293_1024x706.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf30e38e-0661-45a3-b718-275ba0000293_1024x706.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><blockquote><p>The 176 layer NAND, which started mass production in Q4 last year, is based on the same tech platform as the 128 layer.</p></blockquote><p>That is, except for Samsung. Samsung and YMTC are the hopes for NAND capex. Kioxia/WDC, SKHynix, and Micron already 2 deck for their 128 layer generation and 176 layer generation. These firms do not see a large increase in wafer starts either. Samsung was still 1 deck at the 128 layer generation which meant they had a cost advantage due to only having to do the long cycle time drill through etch and deposition steps once. As they move to their 176 layer generation, Samsung should have higher capex relative to others for the same increase in bit output. Those others had that capex intensity increase at 128 or 92 layer NAND.</p><blockquote><p>But then, let's say, especially for SSD, in terms of the product reliability, I would say that the FG would be far superior than the CTF. So -- and also now, other companies are launching the QLC line up these days, but Intel has long been the leader in the QLC, and I would say that now Solidigm has the only technological base that would allow the launch of the PLC line up down the road.</p></blockquote><p>Even though it has been telecasted in the past, I am sorta surprised that SK Hynix will keep running the Intel IMFT NAND nodes. There would be tremendous productivity increase and cost per bit decrease if they transitioned the Intel Dailan fab to SKHynix 176 layer.</p><blockquote><p>We are currently planning to maintain the 2 technologies in parallel.</p></blockquote><p>Lastly, SKHynix says they expect 3D DRAM in the late 2020&#8217;s. ASM International expects it mid 2020&#8217;s. ASML seems to also be more in the later camp. This is certainly interesting to see.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p><strong>Lasertec</strong></p><p>Lasertec absolutely crushed it on orders.

Rohm, if their management and culture had the stomach for it, could raise $1B+ and have an end to end platform from materials to modules that would trounce any of the traditional power semiconductor players such as Infineon, On, or STM. A boy can dream right?</p><p>In the subscriber only section, a bit on Fabrinet as it relates to last weeks subscriber only section short idea.

Only issue with the passing is our lawmakers keep packing a bunch of other unpopular legislation alongside, whether Republican or Democrat. In the end they both agree on this, it&#8217;s just a matter of what pork they want to stuff into the bill. Lawmakers, think tanks, purchasing manager, and many others assure me it will pass this year and the subsidies will be in place.</p><p>If true, semiconductor equipment spending by firms in the US will likely be subsidized to the tune of a 40% tax credit. The logical conclusion to a subsidy of this sort is to spend as much of your capital expenditure in the US and as little as possible outside of the US. There also may be ways to play games with this subsidy though, and even potentially abuse it.</p><p>Intel is currently building out their Ireland Fab 34 as well as some US Fabs for their Intel 4 process node. This is an expensive undertaking, but one that will catch Intel up in process technology if all goes well. The tooling is incredibly expensive, not just from the expensive EUV and DUV lithography tools, but also for all the other associated equipment. Lithography tools will be roughly 20% of Intel&#8217;s spending in Ireland, but many other firms are also receiving orders. One such firm is the Japanese giant, Tokyo Electron.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc3796fc-d1e6-4fdb-8e9f-fd0da691de8d_1024x574.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc3796fc-d1e6-4fdb-8e9f-fd0da691de8d_1024x574.png" width="1024" height="574" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/dc3796fc-d1e6-4fdb-8e9f-fd0da691de8d_1024x574.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:574,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc3796fc-d1e6-4fdb-8e9f-fd0da691de8d_1024x574.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc3796fc-d1e6-4fdb-8e9f-fd0da691de8d_1024x574.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc3796fc-d1e6-4fdb-8e9f-fd0da691de8d_1024x574.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc3796fc-d1e6-4fdb-8e9f-fd0da691de8d_1024x574.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Intel recently put out a <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/ireland-milestone-fab-34.html#gs.ndl8ce">press release</a> about Ireland&#8217;s Fab 34 in which they announced the first tool had been shipped in. The tool in question was called a lithography resist track for EUV by Intel. This tool coats a wafer with photoresist solution by spinning it rapidly. It then passes the wafer on to the lithography tool which reflects light off a mask, exposes the photoresist, and causes a chemical reaction which changes the solvency of the photoresist. The wafer then gets handed back to this tool which bakes the wafer, develops the photoresist, and then rinses away the residual photoresist. <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/lam-research-tokyo-electron-jsr-battle">We describe the process in detail as well as technological developments and the competitive dynamics within the photoresist and track markets in this article.</a></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc879fb4-b075-4364-be10-aa518256321f_1024x576.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc879fb4-b075-4364-be10-aa518256321f_1024x576.jpeg" width="1024" height="576" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fc879fb4-b075-4364-be10-aa518256321f_1024x576.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:576,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc879fb4-b075-4364-be10-aa518256321f_1024x576.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc879fb4-b075-4364-be10-aa518256321f_1024x576.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc879fb4-b075-4364-be10-aa518256321f_1024x576.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc879fb4-b075-4364-be10-aa518256321f_1024x576.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The tool that Intel shipped didn&#8217;t come from the manufacturer though. It came from Intel&#8217;s Oregon facility. That&#8217;s very odd given the tool is a CLEAN TRACK LITHIUS Pro Z from Tokyo Electron.</p><p>Why is this so odd you may ask?</p><p>Because SemiAnalysis has independently confirmed that Intel is taking delivery of at least 2 more of these exact tools in the US before the Ireland tool is running EUV wafers.</p><p>This tool is the only kind in the world that can coat and develop a wafer with EUV photoresist. Tokyo Electron has 100% market share.</p><p>These tools are delivered by plane.</p><p>Why is Intel disassembling a tool in Oregon, shipping it to Ireland by plane, just to take delivery of the exact same tool by plane from Tokyo Electron?</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Is Intel trying to abuse the upcoming CHIPS Act subsidies? Remember the CHIPS Act subsidies only apply if the tool is installed and used in the US.</p><p>So in that way, it makes complete logical sense to ship existing tools out of the US into other fabs, so new orders can take advantage of subsidies. This seems pretty freaking devious don&#8217;t ya think?</p><p>We asked Intel for a comment, and this is what they replied.</p><blockquote><p>It is correct that we are shipping some prior-generation tools from Oregon to Ireland. These tools were previously used for technology development, which we do in Oregon. They are now being transitioned into high volume manufacturing in Ireland, while current generation tools are installed in Oregon for a new technology development cycle. This is a completely normal part of our process to extend the useful life of tools, and something we have done for many years. In fact, we also ship tools back to the US, and among our fabs worldwide.</p></blockquote><p>We take issue with some of these statements. We went deep down this rabbit hole and asked our unofficial contacts for more info. We&#8217;ll share what we learned.</p><p>The tool in question being shipped into Oregon and shipped out of Oregon into Ireland are both CLEAN TRACK LITHIUS Pro Z from Tokyo Electron. There is no next generation of this tool released. With that said, the tool is not identical. Semiconductor capital equipment firms are constantly upgrading tools whether its software or new experimental features or process flows. In this case, the new tool Oregon is receiving has a new pre-exposure bake that has been added. <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/lam-research-tokyo-electron-jsr-battle">This tool will be used to experiment with metal oxide photoresist in the future.</a> Physically the new tool is still essentially identical though.</p><p>Intel has a philosophy and manufacturing principal called &#8220;Copy Exact&#8221;. In essence, Intel makes every environmental and process condition identical down to the generation of tool. This has been amazing for Intel because they can ramp nodes in new fabs very easily because they ensure all conditions are identical. Copy exact has also hurt Intel in the past in some cases because they continue ordering outdated tools and won&#8217;t switch to newer, more efficient generations.</p><p>A classic example of copy exact being damaging is with lithography tools from Nikon. Intel has purchased Nikon&#8217;s inferior lithography tools for some parts of their process flow despite objectively superior ones being available from ASML. They have remedied this, but it was a practice that existed for over a decade. Every other major fab such as TSMC and Samsung had long since reduced order volumes at Nikon heavily and moved volume over to ASML.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>With copy exact, Intel is shipping an existing tool which is known to work well for the Intel 4 test chips. Intel is ensuring no variables changed, to gaurantee a good ramp of the node. At the same time, they are shipping a tool with a new experimental feature to Oregon, the main development and test fab, so that can develop them for future nodes.</p><p>Another underappreciated aspect of semiconductor manufacturing that an unnamed friend inside Intel described was the incredibly complicated multivariate calculus that involve tool positions, run times, throughputs, variance in time between tools, the wafer highway that transports wafers across the fab, and much more.</p><p>Think about it, a semiconductor fab is thousands of multi-million-dollar tools passing crystallized silicon back and forth to create billions of on-off switches that are perfectly interconnected to do calculations. There are hundreds of genius engineers whose job it is to solve the problem of optimal layouts of these fabs in order to maximize throughput per unit of cleanroom space and tool. <a href="https://vimeo.com/showcase/8574304/video/613030735">Here is some b-roll from inside the fab to demonstrate our point.</a></p><p>The Oregon fab is being expanded and reconfigured constantly because it is the test development fab. There is some high-volume manufacturing there aswell. Intel likely cannot reconfigure the fab entirely the way they&#8217;d like without disassembling and moving some tools anyways. In this case, it makes sense to send some tools elsewhere while the fab is reconfigured and expanded.</p><p>On the topic of subsidies, Intel also responded with the following:</p><blockquote><p>This has nothing to do with subsidies, and certainly nothing to do with subsidies under the CHIPS Act. The CHIPS Act is not yet funded by Congress and there is neither an application process nor a disbursement mechanism, which will take further time to set up once funding is allocated to the Commerce Department.</p></blockquote><p>We don&#8217;t entirely agree with Intel&#8217;s comment on application process and disbursement mechanisms. While the funding isn&#8217;t set in stone, it&#8217;s pretty well defined in the House and Senate versions of the CHIPS Act. Remember, part of the CHIPS Act has already passed in past, but the money was never allocated. The commerce department is ready to start doling out cash for projects immediately when congress allocates the money. Intel and the government have had some pretty extensive interactions and even press conferences.</p><p>With that said, we agree the tool movement has nothing to do with the subsidies, but hopefully you found this rabbit hole interesting. Behind the subscriber only wall is some information about the photoresist, metal oxide resist, and the coater/developer market that is heating up with competition. Including a name I think is worth investing in for the long term.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/is-intel-shipping-tools-out-of-us?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/is-intel-shipping-tools-out-of-us?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p>

This is required reading because the most interesting parts are what you can read through about other firms in the supply chain that sometimes are seemingly even unrelated. Some themes in the previous post will continue on, but others will not. In this post we will cover Tesla, Apple, KLAC, MKS Instruments, MACOM Technologies, Silicon Motion, and STMicroelectronics.</p><p><strong>Tesla</strong></p><p>While Tesla isn&#8217;t purely a semiconductor company, they do have some really interesting semi ambitions as part of their larger overarching goals. We have talked about the semiconductor design ambitions in 3 separate articles last year, but I&#8217;m not here to talk about Tesla today. I just want to lighten the mood by quoting Elon from the recent earnings call.</p><blockquote><p>Like that little chip that allows you to move your seat back and forth, that actually was a big problem. But a lot of these things are alleviating. I think there's some degree of the toilet paper problem as well where there was a toilet paper shortage during COVID. Obviously, it wasn't really certainly a tremendous enhanced need for ass wiping. It's just people panicked and got every paper product you could possibly wipe your ass with basically. And I wasn't sure, is this like a real thing or not? I actually took my kids to the H-E-B and Walmart in Texas to just confirm if it was real. Indeed, it was. And there's plenty of food and everything else but just nothing, no paper products. That didn't cause us [plenty].</p><p>An odd choice for people to panic about, yes, because these things are -- actually, if end of the world is coming, I think toilet paper is the least of your problems. So I think we saw just a lot of companies over-order chips and then buffer the chips. And so we should see, and we are seeing, alleviation in almost every area. But the output of the vehicle goes with the least lucky. What are the most problematic items in an entire car? There seems like at least 10,000 unique parts in the car, way more than that if you go further up the supply chain. And so which one is going to be the least lucky one this time? It's hard to say.</p></blockquote><p>Okay you had your laugh? Now back to the serious business.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>I don&#8217;t agree with Elon fully because inventories aren&#8217;t building that much anywhere across the auto ecosystem, there are some minor builds at component suppliers and auto OEMs, but nothing even close to the old levels of inventory let alone the mandates to have 1 year of inventories. The more interesting quotes relative to auto semi demand are as follows:</p><blockquote><p>So last year, we spent a lot of engineering and management resources solving supply chain issues: rewriting code, changing our chips, reducing the number of chips we need, with chip drama central. And that was not the only supply chain issue. So there's just hundreds of things. And as a result, we were able to grow almost 90% while at least almost every other manufacturer contracted last year. So that's a good result.</p></blockquote><p>Tesla is lean and willing to skip many validation cycles that other auto OEMs will not. Despite that&#8230;</p><blockquote><p>And just to repeat Drew's point, we still expect to be partly or primarily chip limited this year. So that's the thing that's actually the driver. And that chip limitation should alleviate next year.</p></blockquote><p>Cars don&#8217;t stop being chip limited in 2023. GM has said it, Ford has said it, Tesla has said it.</p><p><strong>Apple</strong></p><p>Continuing with the trend of non-semi companies that are doing semi, Apple. Apple kicks way more ass in semi of course, and their supply chain for semi is nuts. It would take teams of people to fully track it. I try my best. If you recall from <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/semiconductor-roundup-1272022">yesterday&#8217;s post,</a> we brought up some pretty gnarly inventory builds across the apple supply chain. Well their earnings here were great news. Apple crushed it.</p><p>The good: iPhone consensus was $67.82B and actuals were $71.63, so $3.81B more iPhones were sold then the street expected. This is a massive amount of semi when you go look at the bill of materials teardown for an iPhone. This also means the supply chain is healthy in terms of inventory levels. Mac&#8217;s beat street consensus by 14.3%, with $10.85B of sales the M1 Mac transition has led to meaningful share gains.</p><p>The bad: iPad did poorly with a 10.7% miss, but that isn&#8217;t all too shocking given rumors of Apple deprioritizing iPad for iPhone in the early and middle parts of last year.</p><p>The ugly: No guidance was given. Are supply chain issues gonna hammer Apple? They are masters of this, but one has to imagine at some point they get clobbered by them.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p></p><p><strong>KLA</strong></p><p>Speaking of supply chain issues&#8230;</p><p>We spoke about Lam Research supply chain issues on the last post, they had a specific culprit that cost them $200M+, which we named in the subscriber only section. For KLA, that supplier is not really in the picture. Despite this, they did deal with quite the crunch. The same story as autos applies here. Supply chain issues will plague the industry until next year, gradually getting better. Q1 revenue guidance is being held down 8% to 10% due to supply chain issues.</p><p>Before you go blaming semicap, think about it&#8230; You sell a bunch of multi-million dollar technical equipment that arranges atoms perfectly to make rocks think. It has to be kept perfectly unblemished and transported across international waters in planes. It then must be assembled and calibrated in someone else&#8217;s factory that may or may not be shut down due to Covid. Of course supply chains will explode when faced with the greatest supply chain crisis in at least a generation. This is exacerbated by the fact that the business is twice as large as it was pre-Covid.</p><p>Process control intensity seems to continue to increase in the long term. I do expect KLA to have a light amount of undergrowth versus Nova and Onto. KLA ranks growth markets by Foundry/Logic, 3D NAND, then DRAM. This is consistent with other capex announcements. &nbsp;In the timeline of a new process, metrology ramps first, so Intel will be spending an outsized amount on metrology. To be clear, their spend on metrology as a percentage of total spend will be higher than TSMC due to the larger number of node transitions.</p><blockquote><p>We feel confident in our ability to grow throughout the year with total company revenue growth exceeding 20% and semiconductor process control systems revenue to outperform WFE growth again.</p></blockquote><p>H2 is going be to be strong given how weak Q1 is due to shipping nightmares and Malasyia/China covid shut downs. I like KLA, but I think it is still a little too expensive compared to peers. It&#8217;s also not that expensive given the wafer fab equipment spend environment going forward... They are only trading at 17x consensus forward, and consensus for all semicap is a bit low. KLA has grown 7 years in a row now, so&#8230; they probably deserve to not be looped in with other players who are a bit more cyclical. KLA also has better margins. Services and software are a bigger part of metrology and inspection versus other types of semiconductor capital equipment.</p><blockquote><p>But in a historical context, if you went up as much as our revenues have, we would see volume discounting happening with our suppliers, which would bring down some of the costs, and that's not really happening in this environment.</p><p>So there's a little bit of a cascading that happens whenever you have a disruption in a facility that's already running full out, I mean, equipment is running 24/7, people are working up to legal limits in terms of overtime.</p></blockquote><p>This environment is nuts!</p><blockquote><p>So if you think about some of the big new greenfield projects that have been announced, those are '23 projects, not '22. So I think the combination of those that are related to both supported from the regionalization efforts driven by things like the CHIPS Act in the U.S. should that come to pass. But even the other projects, which aren't dependent on that, are really much more about '23 than they are about '22. So as we look at it now, we do have pretty good visibility out through the end of the year and even into the first part of next year for the demand to continue to be very supportive of our business.</p></blockquote><p>2023 will be a growth year!</p><blockquote><p>And over the long run, we believe that WFE, given rising capital intensity will grow faster than semiconductor revenue in terms of a long run trend.</p></blockquote><p>KLA saw a huge China deceleration from 33% to 23%. I blame lockdowns, because China sure isn&#8217;t stopping on equipment ordering.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p><strong>MKS Instruments</strong></p><p>Moving forward to MKS Instruments, the largest subcomponent/system supplier to semiconductor capital equipment firms. They did a good job executing in the 4th quarter, but Q1 we get more supply chain issues. They expect to be slightly down or flat compared to the 4th quarter in the semiconductor market.</p><blockquote><p>We continue to execute on our strategy to gain share with key lithography, metrology and inspection customers. Our photonics sales, the Semiconductor Market exited 2021 at well over a $300 million annual run rate.

This unit grew 50% year over year organically, but with an acquisition, it grew 90% inorganically. I like MKSI, but I would simply caution do not go to crazy trying to understand every single segment, subsegment, and competitive/pricing dynamics within them. Trust me, you never will.

So it's really not necessarily the most advanced types of electronic components. And these components are shared in multiple industries, and that's where we're seeing the constraints. So no change really from the past.</p></blockquote><p><strong>MACOM Technologies</strong></p><p>We missed this, but MACOM sold their stake in Ampere and recorded a nice profit. Very curious to know which party had the call option on the stake. They must be incredibly bullish. SemiAnalysis has heard some great things about the 5nm based Siryn which utilizes a custom developed core that can be deployed in huge core counts without sacrificing too much silicon area.</p><blockquote><p>Next, I'd like to provide some additional information regarding the December 2021 sale of our less than 10% equity interest in Ampere Compute Holdings or $127.8 million. Our equity interest in Ampere was established back in 2017 when MACOM divested applied Microcircuit Corporation's Arm-based compute business. MACOM was a passive investor in Ampere, not involved in its operations, and we had limited rights.</p><p>One of Ampere's other limited liability members exercised its call option, which was established in 2017. The $127.8 million cash consideration amount was also established back in 2017. Our fiscal Q1 2022 financials reflect a $118.2 million GAAP gain recorded as other income. This gain represents the difference between the $127.8 million of proceeds and our approximate $9.6 million carrying value of the investment. There was substantially no tax impact as we were able to utilize net operating losses to offset the gain. This transaction further strengthens MACOM's financial position.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Silicon Motion Technology</strong></p><p>SSD controllers have been tight for a year and half now, so this could be a knockout the park. At current pricing and increase in capacity, they can grow 20%-30%, but they believe they can grow much more if they secure more wafer supply from TSMC, raise price, and shift mix. They had a similar guidance last year and ended up growing 71%. This will not be repeated, but there is meaningful upside to Silicon Motion.</p><p>Client SSD market share now sits at 35% to 40%, sounds great, but long term I worry as Samsung and SK Hynix want to fully in source controller supply. Despite this, in PCIe Gen 4 SSDs (higher end and higher margin), Silicon Motion expects to be at 50% share by the end of this year. The real story to watch is the datacenter SSD story, especially PCIe Gen 5. ASPs and margins here are much better.</p><p>The wafer supply story is quite interesting. Silicon Motion is actually receiving less supply in Q1 sequentially, but in the 2nd half, they will receive a solid uptick. The firm pretty firmly says their bottleneck to growth is wafer supply, and this isn&#8217;t just short term, but the next 3 to 5 years. Wow. Talk about a long, protracted, tight market. Later on in the call, the founder/CEO backpeddled to say they can keep the trajectory if they can keep execution going, recruit talent in R&amp;D, and get sufficient wafer supply.</p><blockquote><p>We are in severe shortage in certain technology nodes, including 55-nanometer and all advanced technology nodes, 16-nanometer and 12-nanometer. However, I think we are comfortable in 28-nanometer wafer supply. We are just balancing [40/45-nanometer].</p><p>Frankly speaking, all the major new PCIe Gen4 are 12-nanometer technology node. And we just don't have enough wafer to support the demand to fill. If we have sufficient, I think we will revise guide immediately. For -- in addition is our UFS controller is 3.1 that uses TSMC 16-nanometer. We also have a severe shortage. Even TSMC increased in amount compared with the 2021, but they're not enough to meet our customer demand in 2022. So we'll continue to work with our customers, with TSMC together to gain additional wafer supply.</p><p>As I mentioned, 28-nanometer, we are a little comfortable. We could do a better wafer allocation in 28-nanometer to gain incremental sales revenue even without the additional allocation in advanced technology nodes.</p></blockquote><p>This isn&#8217;t perfectly applicable to TSMC&#8217;s utilization or overbooked rates. From other channel checks, 28nm and 40/45nm are the tightest and 16/12nm is also fully booked, but not by as much. Wafer price increases confirm our view, but these comments surely put our view into question.</p><blockquote><p>I think all the module makers, they are expecting NAND price decline continually. So they hesitate to really capture very large volume of NAND, so they don't need a more controller inventory. It looks like the channel inventory now also very low in China, and the activity has become very -- is very actively. So this is a very positive move, and we see the backlog moving up very strong even with mature technologies, particularly in the legacy node. And this is helpful for us to increase our confidence China market will recover strongly from late Q1 to late Q2.</p></blockquote><p>I share my thoughts on the stock in the subscriber only section.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p><strong>STMicroelectronics</strong></p><p>STM preannounced revenue already, so much of the financial release was a foregone conclusion.

Quite a bit of interesting news is coming out and we&#8217;ve got a lot of takes and analysis. In this post we will cover Teradyne, Lam Research, Wolfspeed, Texas Instruments, UMC, Intel, Xilinx, Samsung, and MediaTek. I recommend you read all of them given the most interesting parts are what you can read through about other firms in the supply chain that sometimes are seemingly even unrelated.</p><p><strong>Teradyne</strong></p><p>Teradyne had a good 2021, and they claim that there has been no test equipment installed for the upcoming boom in semi spending. The most interesting part of the earnings release was this quote.</p><blockquote><p>However, in 2022, we expect a slower technology transition in one of our major end markets to result in lower System-on-a Chip test demand for Teradyne before accelerating again during the ramp of 3nm production in 2023.</p></blockquote><p>We have known Apple would not be releasing an iPhone with TSMC N3 for quite some time. The news here should have been known coming a mile away because how Apple heavy Teradyne is. Teradyne is going to hurt in the short term on earnings due to test intensity falling due to lack of node shrink.</p><p>And we didn&#8217;t even get into the the huge sales by insiders&#8230; not a good look at all for Teradyne.</p><p>Advantest should fare much better in 2022 as they are not Apple heavy. While other smartphone SOC suppliers such as MediaTek and Qualcomm do go through major node transitions, these transitions will not be as test intensive as Apple&#8217;s due to the nodes already being ramped and yielding well. The brightest spot will be RF testing for WiFi 6E and WiFi 7.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p><strong>Lam Research</strong></p><p>Lam Research had an incredibly bad quarter, and they missed earnings by quite a bit. This wasn&#8217;t due to demand slowing down. In fact, their order backlogs continue to grow, and the deferred revenue bucket is now at $1.46 billion. The issues is all supply chains. Lam stated they could have as much as another $500 million of deferred revenue due to continued supply chain issues in the next quarter. Lam also seemed certain 2023 would be higher wafer fab equipment spend versus 2022 due to all the shells being built out that would then take in tools and various customers commitments.</p><p>Lam is a bit odd in how they count wafer fab equipment spend as they count mid-$80 billion for 2021 when the actual industry spend seems to be more like $94 billion. With that in mind, they believe 2022 will be $100 billion for 2022. If we apply the 18% higher delta of real WFE to Lam's definition than the real 2022 number would be $110 billion of wafer fab equipment! Kind of a backwards way of arriving at this number, but I have $113 billion given no more major supply disruptions in 2022 using a different methodology.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d096b48-9517-4c1f-8562-f99d2faf0bba_1023x566.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d096b48-9517-4c1f-8562-f99d2faf0bba_1023x566.png" width="1023" height="566" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1d096b48-9517-4c1f-8562-f99d2faf0bba_1023x566.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:566,&quot;width&quot;:1023,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d096b48-9517-4c1f-8562-f99d2faf0bba_1023x566.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d096b48-9517-4c1f-8562-f99d2faf0bba_1023x566.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d096b48-9517-4c1f-8562-f99d2faf0bba_1023x566.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d096b48-9517-4c1f-8562-f99d2faf0bba_1023x566.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>A big part of the miss from Lam was lockdowns in China. With Yangtze Memory Technology Corporation in Wuhan, Micron and Samsung in Xian, Intel&#8217;s old NAND fab that is now owned by SKHynix in Dalian, and SMIC all over China, there were a lot of opportunities for disruption. These disruptions partially caused NAND to fall from 45% of Lam's revenue to 35%. China's contribution to revenue fell from 37% of revenue to 26%.</p><p><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/China-s-Tsinghua-Unigroup-axes-major-memory-chip-projects">Nikkei reported major news yesterday</a>, but the fab project was long since dead and was never embedded into Lam's forecasts.</p><blockquote><p>The second project to be ditched was in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, where Tsinghua Unigroup planned to build a $24 billion facility for 3D NAND flash memory chips, according to government documents and sources briefed on the matter</p></blockquote><p>Lam Research also blamed a supplier for more than $200 million of missed shipments. We named supplier behind the subscriber only wall. In addition, behind the wall is a semiconductor capital equipment firm that is exposed to this exact same issue. These disruptions seem to be constant, but slow alleviation of supply chain issues will mean the back half of the year will be especially high for wafer fab equipment shipments.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa454f456-efc3-43a4-946f-ff236c72212b_1024x571.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa454f456-efc3-43a4-946f-ff236c72212b_1024x571.png" width="1024" height="571" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a454f456-efc3-43a4-946f-ff236c72212b_1024x571.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:571,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa454f456-efc3-43a4-946f-ff236c72212b_1024x571.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa454f456-efc3-43a4-946f-ff236c72212b_1024x571.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa454f456-efc3-43a4-946f-ff236c72212b_1024x571.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa454f456-efc3-43a4-946f-ff236c72212b_1024x571.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Lam Research has an expansion in Ohio for a parts facility, which I found especially interesting given the fact that Intel has just announced a mega-fab in the state. The &#8220;silicon heartland&#8221; as Pat Gelsinger coined it, is already coming to fruition.</p><p>Lam Research is going to grow into one of my largest holdings. Any price under $550 is an instant buy. Lam sits in a very advantageous position in the semiconductor capital equipment world with their dominating position in 3D NAND. NAND has had steady 30%+ bit growth annually, but capex hasn't increased much in recent years. Interestingly enough, the more efficient a firm's tools are, the less a fab will buy. Scaling trends in NAND have allowed layer counts to grow to 192 layers with relatively low capex intensity, but beyond 192 layers, capex intensity should start to increase. When share gains in Foundry/Logic/DRAM are stacked on, it starts to become especially appealing. For example, Lam's selective etch platform will double in revenue this year, and it is critical in many parts of semi, especially with the transition to gate all around transistors.</p><p>Lam&#8217;s business will accelerate through the year and margins will improve. The customers want way more tools than can be reasonably produced give the supply chain issues, and Lam could be poised to outperform even without the technological argument given they will have the most incremental capacity for etch and deposition tools with the new Malaysia facility.</p><p>In the future, I will be detailing these share gains on a market-by-market basis because Lam has not done a good job at telling this story. At the same time, I&#8217;m also not complaining if the price of Lam stays depressed for a bit, Lam is clearly gearing up for some gnarly repurchases and they have the cash + cashflow to do so. Depressed share prices are good for long term shareholder value.</p><p>And because we here at SemiAnalysis love to smack down Morgan Stanley, here is my favorite excerpt from the call transcript where a Morgan Stanley analyst asks a dumb question after not having paid attention during the first half of the call.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb24965d4-f809-46bc-b8cb-310bc91032c6_967x425.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb24965d4-f809-46bc-b8cb-310bc91032c6_967x425.png" width="967" height="425" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b24965d4-f809-46bc-b8cb-310bc91032c6_967x425.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:425,&quot;width&quot;:967,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb24965d4-f809-46bc-b8cb-310bc91032c6_967x425.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb24965d4-f809-46bc-b8cb-310bc91032c6_967x425.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb24965d4-f809-46bc-b8cb-310bc91032c6_967x425.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb24965d4-f809-46bc-b8cb-310bc91032c6_967x425.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"></figcaption></figure></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p><strong>Wolfspeed</strong></p><p>The story with Wolfspeed this quarter is quite simple. Margins creeped up, RF + 150mm substrate businesses are doing well with $100 million of unmet demand, and they continue to make progress on 200mm. The Mohawk Valley fab is starting to become a reality. Test wafers will start processing this quarter.</p><p>The only important number from these earnings was that they received $1.6 billion of design-ins last quarter. The vertically integrated device narrative is the only story makes the Wolfspeed stock work. SemiAnalysis believes Wolfspeed raises capital in late 2023 to fill out the rest of the Mohawk Valley fab. We also believe that Wolfspeed could use this raise to break ground on the 2nd fab at the same site targeting high volume production in 2026.</p><p><strong>Texas Instruments</strong></p><p>TI did great as usual, and the content growth story keeps chugging. Industrial are up 40% year over year, automotive was up high single digits, personal electronics was down upper single digits, communications equipment was up 25%, and enterprise systems was up 50%.</p><p>Industrial is 40% of TI&#8217;s business. Putting up 40% growth numbers in this segment is just bonkers. There was also strong growth in the communications segment. Industrials + non-smartphone communications is what is lumped into internet of things and edge at other firms. Other firms will likely do very well in this segment as well. I give my top pick for this in the subscriber only section.</p><p>Automotive wasn&#8217;t as strong as previous quarters. Automotive is starting to show that shortages, at least from TI&#8217;s end, are mostly gone. We are approaching steadier long-term growth rates rather than crazy catch up growth. The personal electronics segment was horrible, even accounting for seasonality of this business. personal electronics read throughs may be poor in the Android camp. Apple supply chain had some gnarly inventory builds from the most recent iPhone cycle, so there could just also be some digestion of that inventory.</p><p>Lastly, the lion in the room, enterprise (read datacenter). While datacenters do not have much analog content, the 50% growth is very important to read through regardless. Companies that are datacenter levered are going to see great growth.</p><p>TI also has started to build inventory. Their inventory is way below the level it used to run at pre-shortages but going from 112 days to 116 days is something to note. Especially given that TI has put the pedal to the metal on capital expenditures. TI is building out multiple 300mm wafer fabs. Investors may not like the capex spend much, but thankfully TI is thinking a bit longer term.</p><blockquote><p>CapEx has been going up and will continue to go up over a number of years with those investments that I mentioned. Those are long-term investments. Those are going to set us up great for the next 15-plus years. So I'm very happy about this. I'm pleased with that. We're confident about those. But that does flow through the P&amp;L as higher depreciation. So I expect CapEx to go up, and depreciation will follow. And that will have an impact on gross margins. But frankly, at the end of the day, that's accounting. The investment is happening now. It will happen over the next few years with that additional CapEx, and that will just put us in a great position to grow the top line and have really great fall-throughs over a long time to come.</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p><strong>UMC</strong></p><p>UMC continues to run at 100% utilization, sign longer term agreements, slowly expand supply, and increase price quite a bit. Prices were already up about 16% last year and Q1 comes with another 5%. More prices will come through the rest of the year as well. Capacity is so tight, UMC can dictate some pretty favorable terms. UMC believes oversupply would come "beyond 2023", and they believe they are well positioned due to long term agreements.</p><p><strong>Intel</strong></p><p>Intel is playing out how most people expect it, but there are some interesting details in the earnings. Intel continues to beat their guidance and make buckets of cash, but Intel&#8217;s stock went down. The Q1 2022 guidance has a 49% gross margin guidance which is the lowest Intel has seen since at least the global financial crisis.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1820a892-9972-4b39-8cdd-2b45ec264494_1024x572.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1820a892-9972-4b39-8cdd-2b45ec264494_1024x572.png" width="1024" height="572" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1820a892-9972-4b39-8cdd-2b45ec264494_1024x572.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:572,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1820a892-9972-4b39-8cdd-2b45ec264494_1024x572.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1820a892-9972-4b39-8cdd-2b45ec264494_1024x572.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1820a892-9972-4b39-8cdd-2b45ec264494_1024x572.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1820a892-9972-4b39-8cdd-2b45ec264494_1024x572.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>These horrible, 49% margins are despite Intel&#8217;s average selling prices in server, laptops, and desktops are increasing. The 10nm ramp of Alder Lake desktop, mobile, and Ice Lake server are the culprits. Intel has products that can sell at somewhat higher prices due to the current semiconductor market environment, but their manufacturing costs on 10nm are still very high. Intel claimed their 10nm manufacturing costs were down 30% year over year, but all that tells us is that the starting point was horrible. Intel is also blaming the low margins on expenses related to the start up of their Intel 4 node.</p><p>Lastly on margins, Intel is ratcheting up stock-based compensation to match the rest of the semiconductor industry. Intel salaries are generally competitive, but they pay very poorly in restricted stock units (RSUs). Intel isn&#8217;t increasing RSUs across the board. 2 major groups are receiving outsized increases, Long Term Development (LTD) and the design organizations. LTD is the process group that takes technologies from the research group (components) and develops them all the way to ramp, and design organizations are the designers and architects of the chips. Pay increases are being put where they are needed the most, process and chip design. Groups such as marketing, non-development product teams, components research, HVM manufacturing, and administration are receiving smaller increases.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcef3e964-3817-466a-a058-1485e3927f88_1023x564.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcef3e964-3817-466a-a058-1485e3927f88_1023x564.png" width="1023" height="564" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cef3e964-3817-466a-a058-1485e3927f88_1023x564.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:564,&quot;width&quot;:1023,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcef3e964-3817-466a-a058-1485e3927f88_1023x564.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcef3e964-3817-466a-a058-1485e3927f88_1023x564.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcef3e964-3817-466a-a058-1485e3927f88_1023x564.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcef3e964-3817-466a-a058-1485e3927f88_1023x564.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Client computing group had a spectacular quarter with all things held equal, but there is quite the dark spot in notebooks. Revenue is down quite a bit despite ASPs soaring. This implies really poor volumes. Desktop had strong growth due to the new Alder Lake desktop ramp. Adjacencies are down quite a bit due to the sale of the home gateway group to MaxLinear (which MaxLinear got for a steal of a price) and the ramp down of the 4G LTE modem business.</p><p>Intel&#8217;s inventories went up significantly and Intel dodged the question when asked. They talked up the big rotation from Chromebook sales to higher end laptops, increased competitiveness (AMD share gains), the home gateway drawdown, and a major customer going vertical (Apple). None of these were satisfactory answers.

The real kicker is that cloud revenue has shrank year over year for 5 quarters in a row. Enterprise and communications really bailed out Intel. Intel claims they shipped more than 1 million Ice Lake server chips which is more than they shipped in the last 3 quarters combined. Despite Ice Lake server launching in the first half of the year, the actual ramp was only Q4. Intel tried to brag with the following comment, but it really sounded pathetic because they couldn&#8217;t really say anything about preventing future share losses.</p><blockquote><p>We expect that our Xeon shipments in December alone exceeded the total server CPU shipments by any single competitor for all of 2021.</p><p>Patrick Gelsinger</p></blockquote><p>One very odd comment Pat Gelsinger made on the call was that Sapphire Rapids is cheaper than AMD&#8217;s Genoa and that it had a better cost structure. All I can say is that Pat is nuts if he thinks Sapphire will command better margins. It should be cheaper to manufacture (there are multiple configs, not just the 1600mm2 behemoth), but it will not be able to command the same price bracket as Genoa.</p><p>Also, something is up with Intel's ethernet, photonics, and base station business. Where is the growth they promised? These markets should be growing a lot faster than the paltry numbers put up by the adjacencies section. I don&#8217;t want to sound the alarm bells, but why is it significantly undergrowing the end markets&#8230;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ceaaab4-eea1-452c-9726-a103439655c3_1023x577.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ceaaab4-eea1-452c-9726-a103439655c3_1023x577.png" width="1023" height="577" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9ceaaab4-eea1-452c-9726-a103439655c3_1023x577.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:577,&quot;width&quot;:1023,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ceaaab4-eea1-452c-9726-a103439655c3_1023x577.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ceaaab4-eea1-452c-9726-a103439655c3_1023x577.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ceaaab4-eea1-452c-9726-a103439655c3_1023x577.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ceaaab4-eea1-452c-9726-a103439655c3_1023x577.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Intel&#8217;s golden child of Mobileye was quite sluggish aswell. It recorded only 7% higher revenue and lower operating income. Due to this sector doing a partial IPO soon, the poor numbers here hurt a lot. If this slowdown is sustained, then there is no way it gets anywhere close to a $50 billion valuation like Intel is hoping for. Intel drummed their chests about 100M Mobileye EyeQ SOCs being shipped over its lifetime. More importantly they announced they are now piloting autonomous vehicle test fleets in New York, Munich, Detroit, Tokyo, Israel, China, and Paris. Commercial robotaxi services launching in Munich and Tel Aviv in 2022. This seems to be ahead of even Waymo as far as geographic diversity of testing and deployment.</p><p>IOTG is the rockstar and is doing really well, not much to say here besides that it is the best part of this earnings report. See Texas Instruments earnings detail for more information as to why. Analog isn&#8217;t similar at all to IOTG business, but some of TI&#8217;s end markets are the same.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p><strong>Xilinx / Intel PSG</strong></p><p>Intel&#8217;s acquisition of Altera and execution since has been horrible. This quarter was especially sad for them. Xilinx had tremendous growth and hit over $1 billion for the first time this quarter, meanwhile Intel&#8217;s Programmable Solutions Group continues to flounder at less than $500 million in revenue. Xilinx also grew 81% year over year in the datacenter, which is just bonkers numbers. My guess is that Microsoft pulled in another round of FPGAs for Project Catapult as they begin their next datacenter buildouts.</p><p>One could blame issues with Intel&#8217;s 10nm like they do everything else in the company, but that isn&#8217;t the case. Versal and Zync, the leading-edge FPGA&#8217;s from Xilinx are only 28% of Xilinx. Intel truly and royally fucked up Altera on lagging FPGAs, not just leading edge. It&#8217;s no wonder so many of the Altera heads left, some even to go to AMD.</p><p>Intel claimed $500 million in lost sales, but our channel checks reveal Xilinx FPGAs have longer lead times, so if anything, Xilinx has more unmet demand and share figures would be even worse. Despite all the positive talk, I think the best outcome for AMD in the acquisition of Xilinx would have been for it to be blocked. They are overpaying through the nose even after falling ~30% in the last month. The deal got China approval today, so it looks like it will close, but I do not like the deal.</p><p>The last thing I will talk about is the new reporting segments that Intel is establishing. It really cleans things up and gives them a new slate. There 6 segments now. Client computing remains mostly untouched, but Intel did add the workstation business in. Datacenter and Artificial Intelligence comprises of datacenter CPUs, Programable Solutions Group, and I presume Habana Labs. 2 poor acquisitions being lumped in with what used to be the golden goose, but now is facing tough competition. Interesting that they stuffed as much garbage as they could into this group.</p><p>The new network and edge group is probably my favorite. The IOT group and all networking focused products such as base stations, photonics, IPUs, and ethernet will be pulled in. This group is stellar, and I look to it being a key growth driver in the future.</p><p>Mobileye is also one of my more favored segments despite the weak quarter. This is unchanged.</p><p>Accelerated computing and graphics is another new group and it will comprise of all discrete graphics products. This is the culmination of Raja Koduri and really puts fire on him. His business unit is now a separate reporting segment with its own P&amp;Ls. Never has he had this, and he really needs to make it shine now.</p><p>Intel Foundry Services is the last group. It will have all wafer and packaging revenues for outside clients. The packaging revenue already started in Q4 as we reported in an earlier subscriber only article. I am happy that Intel is going to break this business out from day 1. It seems like they can stuff a bunch of costs into this and the GPU groups for a while and push the story that they are ramping businesses. Maybe that will work for some investors.</p><p>Intel explained that the foundry services unit would have weaker margins versus the other business units. They also explained that there are customer test chips running on Intel 16 this year. They announced that the Intel 18A process node (the first node with High NA EUV), has had its process design kit released to 3 RAMP-C customers. Given this is a government program, it is hard to guess who, but we do have confirmation that Qualcomm is one of them.</p><p>Intel claimed they manufactured more than 2 million wafers in 2021, which is basically all leading edge. There will be a tiny bit of legacy business and photonics, but the vast majority is 14nm and below. For reference, this is a good bit more that TSMC&#8217;s N5 node, and even a bit more than the TSMC&#8217;s N7 node. Of course TSMC runs many nodes at volume, especially trailing edge, and so their total wafer counts are at 14 million in 2021.</p><p>Intel capex will be more weighted to metrology and chemical infrastructure within the fab versus the rest of the industry due to their difference in number of node ramps and desire to have extra empty fab shells.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p><strong>Samsung</strong></p><p>There is way too much with Samsung to cover in the DRAM and NAND markets, especially given they never give concrete guidance. One item did stand out which that could explain part of Intel&#8217;s poor performance in the DCG adjacencies business, namely the 5G base stations. Samsung talked about winning European business, which could mean Intel lost 5G base station share in favor of Samsung&#8217;s own silicon.</p><p>Samsung spent the most on semiconductor capex in 2021 to the tune of $36B. Most of this is for memory, not logic.</p><p><strong>MediaTek</strong></p><p>MediaTek is near and dear to my heart because the first article on <a href="http://www.SemiAnalysis.com">www.SemiAnalysis.com</a> was literally me making the case MediaTek was undervalued and poised to gain a lot of share. And well they did! MediaTek is guiding 20% growth for 2022. This may be the year they eclipse Broadcom in revenue. 5G penetration in China is nearly complete at 80% which is why growth is slowing down a ton, well that and the fact Huawei is fully displaced. 5G units outside of China will double according to MediaTek, which will be a big boom for content and ASPs. A crazy comment is that they are shipping decent volume to the US, a former Qualcomm stronghold due to patents. MediaTek is also raising prices in some lines, but 5G ASPs will not increase. The mix of 5G to 4G continues to be the story.</p><p>In addition to smartphone, the MediaTek WiFi business is killing it with WiFi 6 and 6E. The power and IC angle is really growing nicely too. They are starting to rack up wins in industrial and auto which is quite interesting. I imagine these are PMICs, not actual high-power ICs. Smart Edge unit encompasses everything from IOT to custom ASIC business to the aforementioned WiFi. I really like this unit, and it should eclipse smartphone in the next few years.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/semiconductor-roundup-1272022?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/semiconductor-roundup-1272022?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p>

Most of Intel&#8217;s packaging technologies also use TCB. Intel has made a very curious bet on the technology as a driver of their packaging needs, one that TSMC has not followed suit with at all. We will discuss how this technology and Intel&#8217;s unique role in the development of it which enables them to be a leader in advanced packaging, but we will also discuss some of the drawbacks. Intel looks to continue their spending on TCB tools with hundreds of millions of dollars of orders flying in for their expansions in Arizona, New Mexico, as well as the new $7B packaging facility in Malaysia. We will first explain the technology, Intel&#8217;s major role in development of this technology, and lastly the tool ecosystem.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93f0f183-e22d-4c85-94db-032f836df3fa_1024x409.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93f0f183-e22d-4c85-94db-032f836df3fa_1024x409.png" width="1024" height="409" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/93f0f183-e22d-4c85-94db-032f836df3fa_1024x409.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:409,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93f0f183-e22d-4c85-94db-032f836df3fa_1024x409.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93f0f183-e22d-4c85-94db-032f836df3fa_1024x409.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93f0f183-e22d-4c85-94db-032f836df3fa_1024x409.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93f0f183-e22d-4c85-94db-032f836df3fa_1024x409.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>To understand TCB&#8217;s advantages, we must first talk the drawbacks of flip chip packaging. As discussed in part 2, the standard flip chip process starts with depositing a flux or non-conductive paste. A die placement tool then accurately places chips on a substrate, interposer, or carrier. This is done in a batch process, so that many packages can have their dies placed all at once. The set of placed dies then go off to a reflow oven or continuous reflow belt furnace, which is also a batch process. Dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of packages are put in an oven, heated up to a temperature that melts the solder to finalize the bond, then those move on to future steps such as flux residue removal and underfill.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56120e50-6878-4030-8ca2-cc1fc2f05318_1023x817.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56120e50-6878-4030-8ca2-cc1fc2f05318_1023x817.png" width="1023" height="817" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/56120e50-6878-4030-8ca2-cc1fc2f05318_1023x817.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:817,&quot;width&quot;:1023,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56120e50-6878-4030-8ca2-cc1fc2f05318_1023x817.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56120e50-6878-4030-8ca2-cc1fc2f05318_1023x817.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56120e50-6878-4030-8ca2-cc1fc2f05318_1023x817.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56120e50-6878-4030-8ca2-cc1fc2f05318_1023x817.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>This process is incredibly fast but comes with some major drawbacks. The largest issues are related to the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). Because the entire package which consists of many different materials, being heated up in a reflow oven causes these different materials to expand at different rates. This isn&#8217;t the best analogy but work with us. If you have ever baked a pie, you know the pie crust, and the filling of the pie do not expand at the same rate. If you are not careful with several different factors, your filling will end up boiling over the top layer of crust and making that crust soggy.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>As the chip and substrate expand and cool, the difference in CTE can cause warpage.

Rather than placing dies and shipping the entire assembly off to a reflow oven in batch processes, a singular tool will place individual dies, apply pressure, and heat them up to reflow the solder balls. TCB solves a few major concerns with standard flip chip. Heat is applied from the top of the chip, so only the chip and C4 solder connections heat up. This minimizes any substrate warpage issues. The force ensures even bonds with no gap variation or tilt. Lastly, when that force is applied, it can be accompanied with rapid vibration, which breaks up oxidation of metals on the copper bonding pad and solder ball. The bond that results in virtually no voids and no contamination.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcba2ad29-3390-474e-a9f8-ee0aa1b1ce27_1024x632.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcba2ad29-3390-474e-a9f8-ee0aa1b1ce27_1024x632.png" width="1024" height="632" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cba2ad29-3390-474e-a9f8-ee0aa1b1ce27_1024x632.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:632,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcba2ad29-3390-474e-a9f8-ee0aa1b1ce27_1024x632.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcba2ad29-3390-474e-a9f8-ee0aa1b1ce27_1024x632.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcba2ad29-3390-474e-a9f8-ee0aa1b1ce27_1024x632.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcba2ad29-3390-474e-a9f8-ee0aa1b1ce27_1024x632.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>TCB enables better electrical properties at the same IO pitch.

An advanced flip chip die placement tool on the other hand places 3,000 to 10,000 die per hour and costs ~450k. These numbers vary widely depending on the tradeoff of accuracy versus throughput and various features that can come with the tool, but its obvious standard flip chip is much higher throughput.

While this is theoretically possible without TCB, the implementation in the real world is much easier given the differences in size of pads and solder caps.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbbca5d3-f84c-41ee-bd88-ccfde5eda760_817x241.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbbca5d3-f84c-41ee-bd88-ccfde5eda760_817x241.png" width="817" height="241" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/dbbca5d3-f84c-41ee-bd88-ccfde5eda760_817x241.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:241,&quot;width&quot;:817,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbbca5d3-f84c-41ee-bd88-ccfde5eda760_817x241.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbbca5d3-f84c-41ee-bd88-ccfde5eda760_817x241.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbbca5d3-f84c-41ee-bd88-ccfde5eda760_817x241.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbbca5d3-f84c-41ee-bd88-ccfde5eda760_817x241.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The capabilities of TCB really start to shine when Intel moves to Foveros Omni. We discussed the technology more in <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/advanced-packaging-part-2-review">part 2</a>, but the copper pillars and ODI dies make Foveros Omni neigh on impossible to package with the standard flip chip process. The first Foveros Omni product will be Intel&#8217;s Meteor Lake, a mass market client architecture designed for 5W SOCs all the way up through high power desktops. Despite including many die, Omni enables large cost savings on manufacturing cost, selecting the optimal process node for IP and minimize die sizes to enhance yields. The package has various bump pitches from 130-micron, 100-micron, and 36-micron.

Intel has been co-developing TCB tools for over a decade, so it would be hard for competitors to instantly to move towards this technology. InFO from TSMC utilizes standard flip chip flows while potentially being a more costly packaging technology due the more expensive substrate. TSMC hasn't advanced packaging but on commodity standard ABF substrates, which is a hinderance in how far down they can bring advanced packaging in terms of cost. At the same time, InFO does have some major advantage which we discussed in <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/advanced-packaging-part-2-review">part 2</a>, namely related to complex routing within the RDL without the use of silicon dies. TSMC does use TCB for HBM, but that is a very different niche than logic stacking.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Hybrid bonding is capabilities beyond anything flip chip TCB can offer, but that technology operates at a completely different point on the cost and performance curve, which diminishes its ability to ramp in volume for the medium term. This will be discussed in part 4. Intel&#8217;s embrace of TCB has enabled them to create optionality&#8217;s around various IP and have many different blocks fabbed on many different nodes without a large penalty in die-to-die connections. The specifics about the strategy on design side are discussed in this article about the <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/tsmc-wants-to-make-intel-dependent">Intel TSMC wafer supply agreement article.</a></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7080a7a-82fc-436b-acbd-b5eb34238048_846x1024.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7080a7a-82fc-436b-acbd-b5eb34238048_846x1024.png" width="846" height="1024" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a7080a7a-82fc-436b-acbd-b5eb34238048_846x1024.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:846,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7080a7a-82fc-436b-acbd-b5eb34238048_846x1024.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7080a7a-82fc-436b-acbd-b5eb34238048_846x1024.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7080a7a-82fc-436b-acbd-b5eb34238048_846x1024.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7080a7a-82fc-436b-acbd-b5eb34238048_846x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>TCB has also been adopted in HBM applications as well. HBM dies need to be extremely thin. The image above is only memory 4 stacks, but as the industry scaled to 8 stacks and beyond, it has become mandatory for Samsung, SKHynix, and Micron to use TCB. In SKHynix&#8217;s upcoming 12 stack HBM3, the demands of die thinness have become so extreme, <a href="https://news.skhynix.com/sk-hynix-announces-development-of-hbm3-dram/">each die is thinned to 30-microns</a>. The bump pitch is similarly, incredibly dense. The only way to enable HBM stack is with TCB technologies currently, but the industry looks forward to potentially using more exotic forms of packaging such as hybrid bonding.</p><p>Due to being the best technology for packaging extremely thin die, TCB was also experimented with by mobile phone applications that shipped in flagship devices using packaging by both OSATs and IDMs. Samsung, Qualcomm/Amkor, and Huawei/ASE have used TCB in some applications related to package on package (PoP) DRAM. OSATs are beginning to order more and more TCB tools, but the largest orders are still from Intel with their custom co-developed TCB platforms. The important things to note about these other use cases is that they aren&#8217;t the same tools as Intel&#8217;s and they aren&#8217;t designed for high power or performance applications.</p><p>The market between ASM Pacific, Kulicke and Soffa, and Besi is quite dynamic for TCB and each one excels in different areas. This has resulted in each having their own niche. Order books are going up in a major way, but not consistently across the 3 due to the niches they each occupy.</p><p>We will discuss this in the subscriber only section.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/advanced-packaging-part-3-intels?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/advanced-packaging-part-3-intels?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p>

Intel and Samsung initiated quite ambitious plans last year that would take their spending on logic semiconductor fabs to $25B+ a year. Alongside these aggressive spending plans, Intel and Samsung pushed roadmaps that would take them to leadership performance, power, and density. TSMC puts ceiling on their ambitious plans.</p><p>TSMC believes the semiconductor industry will grow at 9%. Their forecast foundry growth at 20%, but they project TSMC&#8217;s growth to be at 25%-29%. Intel&#8217;s own projections have them basically flat on revenue, and Samsung isn&#8217;t growing too fast due to DRAM pricing dynamics.</p><p>TSMC&#8217;s plans for 2021 were $25B to $28B, but total spend ended up coming in at $30B. With 2022, this number was expected to be in the $30B to $35B range, but instead TSMC stated they would spend $40B to $44B on expanding capacity. Intel and Samsung are going to have a hard time keeping up with the sheer scale that TSMC is planning for. On the technology front, TSMC continues to reiterate they will maintain leadership power, performance, area, and transistor technology in the industry.</p><p>The large increase over the consensus Wall Street estimate doesn&#8217;t come as a surprise to SemiAnalysis. We have discussed this aspect in the past, but in short, TSMC started accepting prepayments for capacity since Q3 of 2021. These prepayments are for increases in capacity that customers want beyond TSMC&#8217;s plan. This capacity that customers demand necessitates further expansions beyond the $30B to $35B range and so TSMC wanted upfront cash in order to follow through.</p><p>In total, TSMC has collected $6.7B of prepayments over the last 6 months and they will continue to collect more. This trend isn't slowing down. If anything it is accelerating. These prepayments almost pay for the entire increase in fab spending.</p><p><a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/tsmc-wants-to-make-intel-dependent">As mentioned in the Intel TSMC wafer supply agreement article, different customers have different preferential treatment</a>, but this treatment is fair based on exclusivity terms. Nvidia alone contributed to more than $3B of these prepayments to TSMC, with some of their prepayments also going to packaging and test firms.</p><blockquote><p>We entered into several long-term supply agreements, under which we made advance payments of $1.64 billion this quarter and will make future payments of $1.79 billion. Outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply obligations were $6.90 billion, inclusive of the $1.79 billion, up from $2.57 billion a year earlier and up from $4.79 billion in the prior quarter.</p><p>Colette Kress &#8211; Nvidia CFO</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>With this huge capacity expansion also comes some margin expansion. TSMC projects over 53% long term gross margins. This is material increase over the prior guidance which were over 50%. <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/morgan-stanley-just-reduced-tsmcs">Morgan Stanley continues to look idiotic</a> given they claimed TSMC would fall under 50% margins in late 2021 / early 2022 and that TSMC had no price pressure.

It is the first major TSMC node with a greater than 2 year gap since 28nm. TSMC continues to reiterate there will be shipment in the beginning of 2023, so this is a 2.5 year gap versus N5. TSMC also continues to reiterate they have more tape outs on N3 than they did on N5 in the same timeframe, and the answer why is obvious given what Apple, <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/tsmc-wants-to-make-intel-dependent">Intel,</a> and other customers are doing in the midst of the semiconductor design renaissance.</p><blockquote><p>Let me emphasize that we always operate in a good phase and support all our customers opening and fairly. And the IDM customer has been the same. That's also that TSMC's good customer. We also understand that the IDM customer has their own plans for future insourcing, and we already have taken this into our capacity planning consideration.</p><p>Our capacity planning is based on the long-term market demand profile, underpinned by the industry megatrend of 5G and HPC and the semiconductor content enrichment in very end devices. And we do not depend on any 1 single customer or product.</p><p>TSMC Q4 2021 Earnings Call</p></blockquote><p>TSMC made it quite clear that these huge expansions are solely due to Intel&#8217;s movement. <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/tsmc-wants-to-make-intel-dependent">Despite the details of their supply agreement, Intel isn&#8217;t a risky customer to take on and TSMC is playing the long game.</a></p><p>Despite massively increasing capex again, ASML EUV tool production is not increasing measurably. The recent <a href="https://www.asml.com/en/news/press-releases/2022/update-fire-incident-at-asml-berlin">ASML fire</a> will not materially affect TSMC&#8217;s capex plans either. This is further proof to a point SemiAnalysis has been bringing up for a while now. This point is that wafer fabrication equipment spend intensity on lithography tools stops increasing after 3nm nodes. More spending will go to other tool vendors especially in deposition, etch, metrology/inspection, and advanced packaging related tools/testers.</p><p>TSMC&#8217;s stock will certainly raise due to this earnings call and the huge increases in expectations for capital expenditure and long-term revenue growth, but they aren&#8217;t the best stock to buy for this rally. Semiconductor capital intensity is increasing very fast. </p><p>We will discuss this in the subscriber only section.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/tsmc-throws-down-a-40b-44b-gauntlet?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/tsmc-throws-down-a-40b-44b-gauntlet?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p>

It is offered by a wide array of firms from foundries, integrated design manufacturers, and outsourced assembly and test firms. In flip chip, a PCB, substrate, or another wafer will have landing pads. A chip is then placed accurately on top with the bumps contacting the landing pads. The chip is sent to a reflow oven which heats up the assembly and reflows the bumps to bond the two together. The flux is cleaned away and an underfill is deposited in between. This is just a basic process flow, as there are many different types of flip chip including but not limited fluxless.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6c7cc58a-6728-4bb6-89f3-160d9d7587e3_631x538.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6c7cc58a-6728-4bb6-89f3-160d9d7587e3_631x538.png" width="631" height="538" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6c7cc58a-6728-4bb6-89f3-160d9d7587e3_631x538.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:538,&quot;width&quot;:631,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6c7cc58a-6728-4bb6-89f3-160d9d7587e3_631x538.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6c7cc58a-6728-4bb6-89f3-160d9d7587e3_631x538.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6c7cc58a-6728-4bb6-89f3-160d9d7587e3_631x538.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6c7cc58a-6728-4bb6-89f3-160d9d7587e3_631x538.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>While flip chip is extremely common, advanced versions with less than 100-micron pitches are less so.

Rather than using the standard flow with ABF films, TSMC uses a process that is more tied to silicon manufacturing. TSMC will lithographically define the redistribution layers using Tokyo Electron coater/developers, Veeco lithography tools, Applied Materials Cu deposition tools. The redistribution layers are smaller and denser than what most OSATs can produce and therefore can accommodate more complex wiring. This process is called fan out wafer level packaging (FOWLP). ASE, the largest OSAT, offer FoCoS (fan out chip on substrate), a form of FOWLP, which also utilizes the silicon manufacturing techniques. Samsung also has their fan out system in package (FOSiP) which is mainly used in smartphones, smartwatches, communications, and automotive. Most smartphones include fanouts from ASE, Amkor, Samsung, or TSMC.</p><p>With InFO-R (RDL), TSMC can package a chip with high IO density, complex routing, and/or multiple chips. The most common products with InFO-R are Apple iPhone and Mac chips, but there are a wide variety of mobile chips, communications platforms, accelerators, and even networking switch ASICs. Samsung has also gotten wins in the networking switch ASIC fanout market with Cisco Silicon One. The advancements moving forward with InFO-R will mostly relate to scaling to larger package sizes with more power consumption and IO.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c824a15-3d80-4e8f-9bc7-e1f933f8290a_1024x851.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c824a15-3d80-4e8f-9bc7-e1f933f8290a_1024x851.png" width="1024" height="851" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2c824a15-3d80-4e8f-9bc7-e1f933f8290a_1024x851.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:851,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c824a15-3d80-4e8f-9bc7-e1f933f8290a_1024x851.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c824a15-3d80-4e8f-9bc7-e1f933f8290a_1024x851.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c824a15-3d80-4e8f-9bc7-e1f933f8290a_1024x851.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c824a15-3d80-4e8f-9bc7-e1f933f8290a_1024x851.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>There have been quite a few rumors that AMD will move to fan out packaging for their upcoming Zen 4 client (pictured above) and server CPUs.

Intel also has the flexibility to design the package to function without EMIB and certain chiplets if needed. Some teardowns of Intel&#8217;s FPGAs have found that Intel will not place the EMIB and active die if the SKU Intel is shipping does not demand it. This allows some optimization around the bill of materials for certain segments. Lastly, Intel also can save on manufacturing costs by only utilizing silicon bridges where needed. This contrasts with TSMC&#8217;s CoWoS which has all die placed on top of a single massive passive silicon bridge. More on this later, but the single largest differentiator between TSMC&#8217;s InFO-LSI and Intel&#8217;s EMIB is choice of substrate materials and manufacturing process.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F107976cd-bf21-4c89-9e75-d7124349f8eb_1023x571.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F107976cd-bf21-4c89-9e75-d7124349f8eb_1023x571.jpeg" width="1023" height="571" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/107976cd-bf21-4c89-9e75-d7124349f8eb_1023x571.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:571,&quot;width&quot;:1023,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F107976cd-bf21-4c89-9e75-d7124349f8eb_1023x571.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F107976cd-bf21-4c89-9e75-d7124349f8eb_1023x571.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F107976cd-bf21-4c89-9e75-d7124349f8eb_1023x571.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F107976cd-bf21-4c89-9e75-d7124349f8eb_1023x571.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>To make things even more complicated, ASE has their own 2.5D packaging technology as well that is distinctly different from Intel&#8217;s EMIB and TSMC&#8217;s InFO-LSI. It is being used in AMD&#8217;s MI200 GPU which will be going into multiple high-performance computers including the US Department of Energy&#8217;s Frontier exascale system. ASE&#8217;s FOEB packaging technology is more similar to TSMC&#8217;s InFO-LSI in that it is also a fan out. TSMC use standard silicon manufacturing techniques to construct the RDL. One major difference is ASE uses a glass carrier panel rather than silicon. This is a cheaper material, but it also has some other benefits which we will discuss later.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb29a460-21b4-40a2-b3cd-f98a16bd1c77_814x488.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb29a460-21b4-40a2-b3cd-f98a16bd1c77_814x488.jpeg" width="814" height="488" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bb29a460-21b4-40a2-b3cd-f98a16bd1c77_814x488.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:488,&quot;width&quot;:814,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb29a460-21b4-40a2-b3cd-f98a16bd1c77_814x488.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb29a460-21b4-40a2-b3cd-f98a16bd1c77_814x488.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb29a460-21b4-40a2-b3cd-f98a16bd1c77_814x488.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb29a460-21b4-40a2-b3cd-f98a16bd1c77_814x488.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Rather than embedding the passive interconnect die within a cavity in the substrate, ASE places the die, builds up copper pillars + solder cap, then builds up the entire RDL. On top of the RDL, the active silicon GPU dies and HBM dies are placed using micro-bumps for connections. The glass interposer is then removed from the package with a laser release process and then the other side of the package is complete before it is mounted onto an organic substrate using the standard flip chip process.</p><p>ASE makes many claims about FOEB versus EMIB, but some are downright wrong. It&#8217;s some understandable that ASE need to market their solutions, but let&#8217;s cut through the noise. EMIB yields are not in the 80% to 90% range. EMIB&#8217;s yields are near 100%. First generation EMIB does have a scaling limit in terms of number of die, but 2nd generation does not. In fact, Intel will be releasing a product with the largest package ever, an advanced package that is 92mm by 92mm BGA package using the 2nd generation EMIB. FOEB does retain advantages in routing density and die to package bump size by using a fanout and lithographically defined RDL through the whole package, but that is also more costly.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Versus TSMC, the biggest difference seems to be the initial glass substrate material versus silicon. Part of this is likely due to ASE having more cost constrained. ASE has to win customers over by offering great technology for less. TSMC is a master of silicon and focuses on the technology they know well, silicon. TSMC has the culture of pushing technology to the furthest bounds, and it was better for them to choose silicon on this push forward.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb6b2e1-1fb0-4b45-9073-372062de0d46_1024x537.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb6b2e1-1fb0-4b45-9073-372062de0d46_1024x537.png" width="1024" height="537" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fcb6b2e1-1fb0-4b45-9073-372062de0d46_1024x537.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:537,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb6b2e1-1fb0-4b45-9073-372062de0d46_1024x537.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb6b2e1-1fb0-4b45-9073-372062de0d46_1024x537.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb6b2e1-1fb0-4b45-9073-372062de0d46_1024x537.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb6b2e1-1fb0-4b45-9073-372062de0d46_1024x537.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Now back to TSMC&#8217;s other advanced packaging options because we still have a few more to go. The CoWoS platform also has CoWoS-R and CoWoS-L platforms. These correspond nearly 1 to 1 with InFO-R and InFO-L. The distinction between these two has more to do with process. InFO is a chip first process where the chip is placed first, then build the RDLs are built around it. With CoWoS, the RDLs are built up then the chip is placed. The distinction is not that important for most folks trying to understand advanced packaging, so we will breeze by that topic today.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9f19dd7-c917-4670-b18f-2cb8ad6ae7f0_1024x443.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9f19dd7-c917-4670-b18f-2cb8ad6ae7f0_1024x443.jpeg" width="1024" height="443" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d9f19dd7-c917-4670-b18f-2cb8ad6ae7f0_1024x443.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:443,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9f19dd7-c917-4670-b18f-2cb8ad6ae7f0_1024x443.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9f19dd7-c917-4670-b18f-2cb8ad6ae7f0_1024x443.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9f19dd7-c917-4670-b18f-2cb8ad6ae7f0_1024x443.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd9f19dd7-c917-4670-b18f-2cb8ad6ae7f0_1024x443.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The big showstopper is CoWoS-S (Silicon Interposer). It involves taking a known good die, flip chip packaging it onto a passive wafer which has wires patterned in it. This is where the name CoWoS comes from, Chip on Wafer on Substrate. It is the highest volume 2.5D packaging platform out there by a long shot. As discussed in part 1, this is because Nvidia datacenter GPUs such as P100, V100, and A100 utilize CoWoS-S. While Nvidia has been the highest volume, Broadcom, Google TPU, Amazon Trainium, NEC Aurora, Fujitsu A64FX, AMD Vega, Xillinx FPGAs, Intel Spring Crest, and Habana Labs Gaudi are just a few more notable examples of CoWoS usage. Most compute heavy chips with HBM, including AI training chips from a variety of startups use CoWoS.</p><p>Just to further hammer home the point on how pervasive CoWoS really is, here&#8217;s a few quotes from AIchip. AIchip is a Taiwanese design and IP firm who primarily assists in EDA, physical design, and capacity work related to AI chips utilizing TSMC&#8217;s CoWoS platform. These quotes come from AIchip, but <a href="https://www.fabricatedknowledge.com/p/on-semi-and-nxpi-alchip-onto-and">Doug O'laughlin of Fabricated Knowledge alerted us of them in his excellent analysis.</a></p><blockquote><p>And we are not allowed to give it (financial guidance) because of the TSMC requesting us not to deliver any numerical guidance to the market.</p></blockquote><p>AIchip, a public firm, is not allowed to give guidance because TSMC said so&#8230;</p><blockquote><p>mass production forecast, we received an incredible high volume from key customers. Number is too large to digest. Honestly, if we can hit, yes we can easily hit another home run if we can get the support from supplier to fulfill just 50% of their forecast. Yes honestly, the NP forecast we receive is incredibly high.</p></blockquote><p>AIchip is incredibly limited in capacity, namely CoWoS</p><blockquote><p>In fact, if a (single cloud) customer come to them individually, they (TSMC) deny all the meeting, but they still work on Alchip. The reason they want to work with us because we are representing more than 30 customers. So yes they need -- they also need to diversify their business concentration. So I think we get -- we can say we get a great support, but of course not 100%. Because all the capacity is booked by the tier 1 customer Daniel mentioned before.</p></blockquote><p>TSMC doesn&#8217;t even take every meeting related to CoWoS capacity because TSMC already sells everything they make, and it would be too much engineering time to support all those designs. On the other hand, TSMC has high customer concentration (Nvidia), so TSMC wants to work with other firms. AIchip sort of works as the middleman, and even though the tier 1 customer (Nvidia) booked everything, AIchip still get some capacity. Even then, they are only getting 50% of what they want.</p><p>Let&#8217;s turn around and look at what Nvidia is doing. In Q3, their long-term supply obligations jumped up to $6.9B, and more importantly, Nvidia made $1.64B of prepayments and will be making another $1.79B of prepayments in the future. Nvidia is gobbling up supply, specifically for CoWoS.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2813f02b-d0d5-438f-a994-75bf40823c0b_700x392.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2813f02b-d0d5-438f-a994-75bf40823c0b_700x392.png" width="700" height="392" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2813f02b-d0d5-438f-a994-75bf40823c0b_700x392.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:392,&quot;width&quot;:700,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2813f02b-d0d5-438f-a994-75bf40823c0b_700x392.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2813f02b-d0d5-438f-a994-75bf40823c0b_700x392.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2813f02b-d0d5-438f-a994-75bf40823c0b_700x392.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2813f02b-d0d5-438f-a994-75bf40823c0b_700x392.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Back to the technology, CoWoS-S has gone through an evolution over the years. The main marque is the interposer area becoming larger. Because the CoWoS platform uses Silicon manufacturing techniques, it abides by a principal called reticle limit. The maximum size a chip can be printed with 193nm ArF lithography tool is 33mm by 26mm (858mm2). A silicon interposer is also lithographically defined for its main purpose, very dense wires connecting chips that sit atop it. Nvidia&#8217;s chips have long since approached the reticle limit themselves, yet still need to connect to on package high bandwidth memory.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16022b6e-9fe3-43db-8b5b-ef1119605eeb_1024x541.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16022b6e-9fe3-43db-8b5b-ef1119605eeb_1024x541.jpeg" width="1024" height="541" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/16022b6e-9fe3-43db-8b5b-ef1119605eeb_1024x541.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:541,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16022b6e-9fe3-43db-8b5b-ef1119605eeb_1024x541.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16022b6e-9fe3-43db-8b5b-ef1119605eeb_1024x541.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16022b6e-9fe3-43db-8b5b-ef1119605eeb_1024x541.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16022b6e-9fe3-43db-8b5b-ef1119605eeb_1024x541.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The image above contains a Nvidia V100, Nvidia's 4 year old GPU which is 815mm2. Once the HBM is included, it extends beyond the reticle limit that a lithography tool can print, yet TSMC figured out how to connect them. TSMC achieves this by doing something called reticle stitching. TSMC has grown their capabilities here and can ship 3x the size of a reticle for silicon interposers. Given limitations of reticle stitching, the Intel EMIB, TSMC LSI, and ASE FOEB approaches have merits. They also do not have to deal with as much expense of a large silicon interposer.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fab5469-75a8-4c3e-aa9f-533bf0eab4a3_720x540.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fab5469-75a8-4c3e-aa9f-533bf0eab4a3_720x540.jpeg" width="720" height="540" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5fab5469-75a8-4c3e-aa9f-533bf0eab4a3_720x540.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:540,&quot;width&quot;:720,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fab5469-75a8-4c3e-aa9f-533bf0eab4a3_720x540.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fab5469-75a8-4c3e-aa9f-533bf0eab4a3_720x540.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fab5469-75a8-4c3e-aa9f-533bf0eab4a3_720x540.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fab5469-75a8-4c3e-aa9f-533bf0eab4a3_720x540.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>In addition to increasing the reticle size, they have made other enhancements such as changing the micro-bumps to copper from solder for improved performance/power efficiency, <a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/tsmc/cowos#Integrated_Capacitor_.28iCAP.29">iCap</a>, a new TIM/lid package, and more.</p><p>There&#8217;s an interesting story about the TIM/lid packaging. With the Nvidia V100, Nvidia had a pervasive HGX platform which would ship to many server ODMs and then out to datacenters. The torque one could apply to coolers screws to achieve the correct mounting pressure was very specific. These server ODMs were overtightening the coolers and cracking dies on these $10k GPUs. Nvidia with their A100 moved to a package that had a lid over the die rather than direct die cooling. The issue with this type of packaging crop up with Nvidia&#8217;s A100 and future Hopper DC GPUs when they still needed to dissipate a huge amount of heat. There is a lot of optimizations that had to go on between TSMC and Nvidia on the packaging to deal with this. Anyways, we will have some information on the packaging and power requirements on the next generation Hopper GPUs behind the paywall.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Samsung also has their I-Cube technology which is similar to CoWoS-S.

The types of stacking leads to a problem where the package substrate has varying height connections to the chip sitting upon it. Intel developed a copper pillar technique that lets them transport signal and power to different z heights and through dies so chip designers can have more freedom when designing 3D heterogenous chips. Foveros Omni will start at a 36-micron bump pitch, but it will move down to 25-micron in a future generation.</p><p>We want to note that DRAM also uses advanced 3D packaging. HBM has been using advanced packaging for years across Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron. The memory cells will be made and connect to TSVs which are revealed and have micro-bumps formed. More recently, Samsung has even began introducing stacks of DDR5 and LPDDR5X which utilize similar stacking technologies to pump up capacity higher. SKHynix HBM 3 will start with 12 dram dies vertically stacked with <a href="https://news.skhynix.com/sk-hynix-announces-development-of-hbm3-dram/">each dram die at 30-micron thickness.</a> SKHynix will also be introducing hybrid bonding eventually in HBM 3. SKHynix will bond 16 chips together and each die will need to be even thinner. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F19578691-f944-4d59-99cc-349eceaebd11_1024x319.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F19578691-f944-4d59-99cc-349eceaebd11_1024x319.jpeg" width="1024" height="319" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/19578691-f944-4d59-99cc-349eceaebd11_1024x319.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:319,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F19578691-f944-4d59-99cc-349eceaebd11_1024x319.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F19578691-f944-4d59-99cc-349eceaebd11_1024x319.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F19578691-f944-4d59-99cc-349eceaebd11_1024x319.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F19578691-f944-4d59-99cc-349eceaebd11_1024x319.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Hybrid bonding is a technology where instead of using bumps, the chip is directly connected with through silicon vias. If we refer back to the flip chip process, there is no bump formation, flux, reflow, or under mold to fill the area between chips. Copper directly meets copper, end of story. The actual process is very difficult and partially detailed above. We will dive more into the tool ecosystem and types of hybrid bonding in the next part of this series. Hybrid bonding enables denser integration than any other packaging method described before this.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F841eab1c-3df5-49f6-a0f8-8e37c92e90ad_1024x576.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F841eab1c-3df5-49f6-a0f8-8e37c92e90ad_1024x576.jpeg" width="1024" height="576" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/841eab1c-3df5-49f6-a0f8-8e37c92e90ad_1024x576.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:576,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F841eab1c-3df5-49f6-a0f8-8e37c92e90ad_1024x576.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F841eab1c-3df5-49f6-a0f8-8e37c92e90ad_1024x576.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F841eab1c-3df5-49f6-a0f8-8e37c92e90ad_1024x576.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F841eab1c-3df5-49f6-a0f8-8e37c92e90ad_1024x576.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The most famous hybrid bonded chip is of course the recently announced AMD&#8217;s 3D stacked cache which is set to release later this year.

In fact, you likely have a device in your pocket that contains a hybrid bonded CMOS image sensor assuming you have a high-end phone.

All sorts of rumors have circulated about this deal from Intel trying to stiff AMD out of capacity to Intel running with their tail between their legs begging TSMC for capacity because their new nodes don&#8217;t work properly. This has all culminated with Pat Gelsinger&#8217;s trip to Taiwan last week. Some argue TSMC is shooting their own foot by supplying Intel. SemiAnalysis wants to clear the air because some of the rumors are ridiculous. We are going to dive into the details for wafer supply agreements including prepayment terms and capacity agreements for AMD, Apple, Broadcom, Intel, MediaTek, Nvidia, and Qualcomm.</p><p>TSMC likes to say they are everyone&#8217;s foundry and that they will supply everyone, but TSMC has their favorites. This doesn&#8217;t preclude TSMC from selling to everyone though. To be clear, TSMC is everyone&#8217;s foundry, but the terms of their agreements are not the same everywhere. TSMC gives quite different terms to their various clients. The most simple is volume pricing, but others include earlier access to technology or other terms. The best way to explain these differences are by first diving into some of the terms of TSMC&#8217;s most important customer, Apple.</p><p>By all measures, Apple is TSMC&#8217;s most important customer. Apple is the largest customer on the most advanced node. <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/advanced-packaging-part-1-pad-limited">Apple utilizes advanced packaging more than any other firm in the form of high-density integrated fan outs (InFO).</a> Apple is 3 times larger than TSMC&#8217;s 2nd largest customer. Apple is the rich friend that TSMC has had for a long time. Apple buys bleeding edge wafers and TSMC knows Apple will pay for them. TSMC knows Apple&#8217;s plans intimately, so TSMC will build out the capacity Apple asks for without demanding prepayments.</p><p>Apple&#8217;s integration with TSMC is so incredibly tight that they work together on defining the original process development kits (PDK) for new nodes. TSMCs other major customers get to have some customization, but Apple drives much of the base PDK.</p><p>Due to Apple being the first to major new nodes, Apple is in a unique position where their seasonal business drives utilization rates for the first year of a process node. In the first Q1 during the lifetime of the N7 process node and N5 process node, TSMC dealt with some underutilization on these respective nodes. Apple gets to buy capacity, but they also have the right to move the capacity they need up and down across the year according to their business needs. The exact details are unknown, but it&#8217;s abundantly clear Apple does not do prepayments for capacity like other customers. Likewise, Apple does not seem to pay charges when they reduce demand early in the year or increase demands mid-year. The advantages of being the tier 1 customer are immense.</p><p>TSMC takes this seasonal element and does something quite clever. Despite Apple not demanding TSMC&#8217;s full capacity of N5 wafers, TSMC continues to manufacture these wafers and holds them on the balance sheet. By pre-manufacturing wafers that TSMC knows they will sell, TSMC retains more capacity for later in the year and maximizes throughput/earnings.</p><blockquote><p>Days of inventory increased 10 days to 83 days, primarily due to N5 wafer prebuild. We prebuild for our customers during seasonal low level as we did before. Now when we start to ramp in the higher season, the inventory usually come down naturally as before.</p><p>Wendall Huang &#8211; TSMC CFO</p></blockquote><p>This paradigm will be changing somewhat with the N3 process node which has twice the number of new design tape outs in the first year relative to the N5 process node. There are a lot more firms hopping onto N3 despite some of the performance and cost per wafer issues. They will deal with some teething pains related to being the first mover that Apple and TSMC have hidden due to their incredibly tight integration.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>AMD and MediaTek are the two other preferred TSMC customers. They are mostly exclusive on the leading edge and therefore they do not deal with having to prepay large amounts for capacity. They get most the leading-edge wafer capacity they need, and the issues for their respective supply chain hinges on other aspects.</p><p>For AMD, these supply issues deal more with substrates and externally at server and notebook ODMs for components such as BMC&#8217;s and WiFi. For MediaTek, these supply issues deal more with PMIC and RFFE. As such, both firms&#8217; pre-payment for supply agreements with TSMC are close to non-existent. <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/2488/000000248821000178/amd-20210925.htm">In Q3 2021, AMD only notched up to $355M of pre-paid long-term supply agreements</a> despite being amid the largest semiconductor supply crunch in decades. Most of this prepayment is dedicated to substrates.</p><p>Both MediaTek and AMD also work very closely with TSMC on customizing process nodes. MediaTek has been in the driver seat for the N6 and N4 node evolutions. MediaTek has been the first customer to use these process nodes by about 6 months. AMD also designs their own custom libraries. They worked on this some at N7, but especially so at the N5 process node. AMD is more so a trailblazer on packaging. TSMC&#8217;s has a testbed and ramp partner for 3D hybrid bonding packaging. This is AMD. Volumes here very small, but AMD has a more than 6 months head start on shipping the technology.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb7a7b3d-d67b-403f-b100-e90176d7e81f_1024x427.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb7a7b3d-d67b-403f-b100-e90176d7e81f_1024x427.png" width="1024" height="427" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/db7a7b3d-d67b-403f-b100-e90176d7e81f_1024x427.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:427,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb7a7b3d-d67b-403f-b100-e90176d7e81f_1024x427.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb7a7b3d-d67b-403f-b100-e90176d7e81f_1024x427.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb7a7b3d-d67b-403f-b100-e90176d7e81f_1024x427.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb7a7b3d-d67b-403f-b100-e90176d7e81f_1024x427.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">TSMC Q3 2021 Financial Filings</figcaption></figure></div><p>Despite TSMC&#8217;s 3 largest and most friendly customers not having pre-payment terms, TSMC has received large payments to retain capacity by her customers. In Q3 2021, TSMC received $580M for capacity within the next 12 months and $3.24B for capacity beyond 12 months. Certainly, some of TSMC&#8217;s customers need to give money up front to get the wafers they need years out.</p><p>At the other end of the spectrum, we have Qualcomm and Nvidia. These firms are very opportunistic with their wafer supply arrangements. They consistently play Samsung and TSMC off each other. Generally, Samsung undercuts TSMC by quite a bit, especially on a cost/transistor basis, and that has allowed them to lure over the 2nd and 3rd largest fabless semiconductor firms in the entire industry.</p><p>Nvidia has played this relationship masterfully. Nvidia has received much lower costs on low end GPUs in the past, and acceptable performance at much lower costs for the entire Ampere gaming and Orin automotive lineup. Nvidia has also been able to secure a lot more supply than they would have been able to access at TSMC, fueling their fantastic growth. Nvidia is also a trailblazer with TSMC by working with TSMC to optimize for massive reticle sized dies and custom libraries for the datacenter GPUs. Nvidia is by far the highest volume 2.5D advanced packaging customer at TSMC.</p><p>Due to Nvidia&#8217;s opportunistic switching between TSMC and Samsung, Nvidia doesn&#8217;t receive the same terms. Nvidia wants a lot of N5 capacity and 2.5D packaging capabilities next year and beyond as they prep launch for Hopper datacenter GPUs, Lovelace gaming GPUs, and continue to gain share in networking versus Broadcom. To secure this supply, Nvidia is prepaying billions to TSMC, something the previous 3 customers have not had to deal with. A big portion of this is also due to Nvidia&#8217;s growth at TSMC due to switching away from Samsung.</p><blockquote><p>We entered into several long-term supply agreements, under which we made advance payments of $1.64 billion this quarter and will make future payments of $1.79 billion. Outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply obligations were $6.90 billion, inclusive of the $1.79 billion, up from $2.57 billion a year earlier and up from $4.79 billion in the prior quarter.</p><p>Colette Kress &#8211; Nvidia CFO</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><blockquote><p>First of all, we have secured guaranteed supply, very large amounts of it, quite a spectacular amount of it from the world's leading foundry in substrate and packaging and testing certain companies, the integral part of our supply chain.</p><p>Jensen Huang &#8211; Nvidia CEO </p></blockquote><p>Qualcomm has played this relationship masterfully, but they have also had a recent misstep. Qualcomm has long since produced many of their low end and midrange SOCs at Samsung, but in 2020, they moved the flagship Snapdragon 800 line to Samsung. A long-speculated item is that Samsung used more Qualcomm SOCs in their smartphones due to their use of Samsung foundry.</p><p>This was a great arrangement up until just recently where MediaTek came roaring back. <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/mediatek-officially-enters-the-flagship">In July, SemiAnalysis exclusively detailed MediaTek&#8217;s usage of N4 for a new flagship SOC.</a> We detailed the exact CPU configuration and cache details many months before MediaTek&#8217;s own announcement. At the time we believed that MediaTek may take the Android CPU crown away from Qualcomm, and that seems to have come true. Benchmarks show MediaTek has a 17% MT performance advantage and a 34% power efficiency advantage on the CPU.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42feb3b6-f1de-4ed6-b7c4-4a7a0a35a2f0_1024x588.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42feb3b6-f1de-4ed6-b7c4-4a7a0a35a2f0_1024x588.png" width="1024" height="588" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/42feb3b6-f1de-4ed6-b7c4-4a7a0a35a2f0_1024x588.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:588,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42feb3b6-f1de-4ed6-b7c4-4a7a0a35a2f0_1024x588.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42feb3b6-f1de-4ed6-b7c4-4a7a0a35a2f0_1024x588.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42feb3b6-f1de-4ed6-b7c4-4a7a0a35a2f0_1024x588.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42feb3b6-f1de-4ed6-b7c4-4a7a0a35a2f0_1024x588.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Qualcomm uses the same stock Arm cores as MediaTek and has also recognized the performance deficit was coming. As such they are doing something completely unprecedented by switching nodes mid-generation. The S8G1, 2022 flagship SOC, is currently on a Samsung node, but mid-year 2022, they will release a version that is on TSMC&#8217;s N4 process node. This will allow all efficiency and performance deficits to be reclaimed. H1 will be a tough comparison for them due to this loss in the CPU category. Of course, heterogenous compute reigns supreme and Qualcomm has a better chip outside this, but they had to scramble. In 2023, Qualcomm will move the entire high end and flagship lineups to TSMC entirely.</p><p>Qualcomm has ~$13B of purchase obligations. This number can&#8217;t be directly compared to Nvidia&#8217;s, but it is a mammoth one. <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/qualcomm-rffe-business-continues">A large portion of these go to Qualcomm&#8217;s RFFE suppliers as they are growing this business in a titanic way.</a> A portion also goes to UMC and PSMC, but TSMC is forcing Qualcomm to sign long term agreements as well.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Before moving onto Intel, we will briefly touch on Broadcom. Broadcom has a diverse supply chain and they use multiple foundries including internal for RFFE, but TSMC is the primary foundry. Broadcom is one of TSMC&#8217;s largest customers, but Broadcom is also the slowest growing amongst the large customers. The slow growth is contrary to the fact that Broadcom is operating in the two fastest growth verticals in the semiconductor industry, networking and RFFE.</p><p>Broadcom is losing share in both, and a portion of it has to do with their capacity arrangements. They have been extremely tepid to increase capacity massively and demand absurd margins for their products. Broadcom&#8217;s technology is fantastic in many niche&#8217;s, but they are slowly being eroded. Future supply growth for Broadcom at TSMC is not that large, and they are making little to no pre-payments for leading edge N5 and N3 capacity. Broadcom is the financial machine who wants good deals on the front end and resells to their clients at very favorable terms. Broadcom has implemented non-cancellation terms into many of their product segments.</p><p>Now, onto Intel. Let&#8217;s start by dispelling this fiction that Intel is buying up capacity to stiff AMD. AMD is getting the capacity they want from TSMC, on the time frame they want. Another fact, Bob Swan has long since agreed to some very large deals. This deal included capacity at N6, N5/4, and N3. This is nothing new.</p><p>TSMC is smart, calculated, and is playing the long game. Yes, TSMC could be helping Intel get back on the horse as Intel works through internal process node issues. TSMC has a longer-term vision, where only they can supply leading edge capacity. In 2022 and 2023, Qualcomm and Nvidia recognize this fully, but are keeping Samsung in the back pocket for the future. They want to do the same to Intel.</p><p>As Intel has moved to more industry standard SOC design flows, the ability for them to design to different process nodes increases. Bob Swan kept using the word &#8220;optionality&#8221; for the change. Intel is keeping their core IP blocks portable and even designing them to multiple processes. Their roadmap includes chiplets on in-house and external processes. There is a battle brewing with Intel on internal process versus external.</p><p>TSMC wants to convert the Intel internal design and product teams to choosing TSMC nodes despite the lower margins. These teams have mostly used Intel nodes for majority of their history despite having external manufacturing account for 20% of total wafer supply. If TSMC can convince Intel design and product organizations that their nodes are better, they can cut the throat of Intel&#8217;s in-house manufacturing.</p><p>Pat Gelsinger has obviously pitched a very different story. He has been investing heavily in manufacturing and is even pushing a foundry service story. SemiAnalysis can confirm that Intel has stopped selling old tools into the market as they will be preserving older node capacity that they cannot transition. While the deals Bob Swan signed are very much binding and do include some pretty harsh terms to prevent cancellation, the long-term story is quite different.</p><blockquote><p>But let's get to '25 and '26, and we say we've overshot a little bit. I have 3 uses for that spare capacity. One is go get more market share, right? If I have leadership products and leadership process, I'm going to do so with good margins. Gain market share back. Second is, I've also built into our business model that we use foundries, right, external foundries as well. So if I have too much capacity, I'm going to pull wafers back from the external foundries and run them internally at better margins. Third, I go win more foundry customers. So I have -- and these are good margin foundry customers as well, just like we're seeing in the leading edge foundry market. So in the off chance that I have any spare capacity, I have 3 tremendous uses of that, that are highly margin and capital and cash flow efficient as well. So to me, those concerns, right, I lust after the day that one of those might actually materialize.</p><p>Pat Gelsinger &#8211; Intel CEO</p></blockquote><p>What is the current Intel TSMC deal? What did Bob Swan sign? How much capacity does Intel have at TSMC in 2023 and 2024? What products will they be moving to external nodes? What about other clients and their capacity arrangements?</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/tsmc-wants-to-make-intel-dependent?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/tsmc-wants-to-make-intel-dependent?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p>These sorts of questions will be answered in the subscriber only section.</p><p>Pat&#8217;s trip to Taiwan was quite interesting to say the least.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Give a gift subscription&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true"><span>Give a gift subscription</span></a></p>

All sorts of rumors have circulated about this deal from Intel trying to stiff AMD out of capacity to Intel running with their tail between their legs begging TSMC capacity because their new nodes don&#8217;t work properly. This has all culminated with Pat Gelsinger&#8217;s trip to Taiwan last week. Some argue TSMC is shooting their own foot by supplying Intel. SemiAnalysis wants to clear the air because some of the rumors are ridiculous. We are going to dive into the details for wafer supply agreements including prepayment terms and capacity agreements for AMD, Apple, Broadcom, Intel, MediaTek, Nvidia, and Qualcomm.</p><p>TSMC likes to say they are everyone&#8217;s foundry and that they will supply everyone, but TSMC has their favorites. This doesn&#8217;t preclude TSMC from selling to everyone though. To be clear, TSMC is everyone&#8217;s foundry, but the terms of their agreements are not the same everywhere. TSMC gives quite different terms to their various clients. The most simple is volume pricing, but others include earlier access to technology or other terms. The best way to explain these differences are by first diving into some of the terms of TSMC&#8217;s most important customer, Apple.</p><p>By all measures, Apple is TSMC&#8217;s most important customer. Apple is the largest customer on the most advanced node. <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/advanced-packaging-part-1-pad-limited">Apple utilizes advanced packaging more than any other firm in the form of high-density integrated fan outs (InFO).</a> Apple is 3 times larger than TSMC&#8217;s 2nd largest customer. Apple is the rich friend that TSMC has had for a long time. Apple buys bleeding edge wafers and TSMC knows Apple will pay for them. TSMC knows Apple&#8217;s plans intimately, so TSMC will build out the capacity Apple asks for without demanding prepayments.</p><p>Apple&#8217;s integration with TSMC is so incredibly tight that they work together on defining the original process development kits (PDK) for new nodes. TSMCs other major customers get to have some customization, but Apple drives much of the base PDK.</p><p>Due to Apple being the first to major new nodes, Apple is in a unique position where their seasonal business drives utilization rates for the first year of a process node. In the first Q1 during the lifetime of the N7 process node and N5 process node, TSMC dealt with some underutilization on these respective nodes. Apple gets to buy capacity, but they also have the right to move the capacity they need up and down across the year according to their business needs. The exact details are unknown, but it&#8217;s abundantly clear Apple does not do prepayments for capacity like other customers. Likewise, Apple does not seem to pay charges when they reduce demand early in the year or increase demands mid-year. The advantages of being the tier 1 customer are immense.</p><p>TSMC takes this seasonal element and does something quite clever. Despite Apple not demanding TSMC&#8217;s full capacity of N5 wafers, TSMC continues to manufacture these wafers and holds them on the balance sheet. By pre-manufacturing wafers that TSMC knows they will sell, TSMC retains more capacity for later in the year and maximizes throughput/earnings.</p><blockquote><p>Days of inventory increased 10 days to 83 days, primarily due to N5 wafer prebuild. We prebuild for our customers during seasonal low level as we did before. Now when we start to ramp in the higher season, the inventory usually come down naturally as before.</p><p>Wendall Huang &#8211; TSMC CFO</p></blockquote><p>This paradigm will be changing somewhat with the N3 process node which has twice the number of new design tape outs in the first year relative to the N5 process node. There are a lot more firms hopping onto N3 despite some of the performance and cost per wafer issues. They will deal with some teething pains related to being the first mover that Apple and TSMC have hidden due to their incredibly tight integration.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>AMD and MediaTek are the two other preferred TSMC customers. They are mostly exclusive on the leading edge and therefore they do not deal with having to prepay large amounts for capacity. They get most the leading-edge wafer capacity they need, and the issues for their respective supply chain hinges on other aspects.</p><p>For AMD, these supply issues deal more with substrates and externally at server and notebook ODMs for components such as BMC&#8217;s and WiFi. For MediaTek, these supply issues deal more with PMIC and RFFE. As such, both firms&#8217; pre-payment for supply agreements with TSMC are close to non-existent. <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/2488/000000248821000178/amd-20210925.htm">In Q3 2021, AMD only notched up to $355M of pre-paid long-term supply agreements</a> despite being amid the largest semiconductor supply crunch in decades. Most of this prepayment is dedicated to substrates.</p><p>Both MediaTek and AMD also work very closely with TSMC on customizing process nodes. MediaTek has been in the driver seat for the N6 and N4 node evolutions. MediaTek has been the first customer to use these process nodes by about 6 months. AMD also designs their own custom libraries. They worked on this some at N7, but especially so at the N5 process node. AMD is more so a trailblazer on packaging. TSMC&#8217;s has a testbed and ramp partner for 3D hybrid bonding packaging. This is AMD. Volumes here very small, but AMD has a more than 6 months head start on shipping the technology.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb7a7b3d-d67b-403f-b100-e90176d7e81f_1024x427.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb7a7b3d-d67b-403f-b100-e90176d7e81f_1024x427.png" width="1024" height="427" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/db7a7b3d-d67b-403f-b100-e90176d7e81f_1024x427.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:427,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb7a7b3d-d67b-403f-b100-e90176d7e81f_1024x427.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb7a7b3d-d67b-403f-b100-e90176d7e81f_1024x427.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb7a7b3d-d67b-403f-b100-e90176d7e81f_1024x427.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb7a7b3d-d67b-403f-b100-e90176d7e81f_1024x427.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">TSMC Q3 2021 Financial Filings</figcaption></figure></div><p>Despite TSMC&#8217;s 3 largest and most friendly customers not having pre-payment terms, TSMC has received large payments to retain capacity by her customers. In Q3 2021, TSMC received $580M for capacity within the next 12 months and $3.24B for capacity beyond 12 months. Certainly, some of TSMC&#8217;s customers need to give money up front to get the wafers they need years out.</p><p>At the other end of the spectrum, we have Qualcomm and Nvidia. These firms are very opportunistic with their wafer supply arrangements. They consistently play Samsung and TSMC off each other. Generally, Samsung undercuts TSMC by quite a bit, especially on a cost/transistor basis, and that has allowed them to lure over the 2nd and 3rd largest fabless semiconductor firms in the entire industry.</p><p>Nvidia has played this relationship masterfully. Nvidia has received much lower costs on low end GPUs in the past, and acceptable performance at much lower costs for the entire Ampere gaming and Orin automotive lineup. Nvidia has also been able to secure a lot more supply than they would have been able to access at TSMC, fueling their fantastic growth. Nvidia is also a trailblazer with TSMC by working with TSMC to optimize for massive reticle sized dies and custom libraries for the datacenter GPUs. Nvidia is by far the highest volume 2.5D advanced packaging customer at TSMC.</p><p>Due to Nvidia&#8217;s opportunistic switching between TSMC and Samsung, Nvidia doesn&#8217;t receive the same terms. Nvidia wants a lot of N5 capacity and 2.5D packaging capabilities next year and beyond as they prep launch for Hopper datacenter GPUs, Lovelace gaming GPUs, and continue to gain share in networking versus Broadcom. To secure this supply, Nvidia is prepaying billions to TSMC, something the previous 3 customers have not had to deal with. A big portion of this is also due to Nvidia&#8217;s growth at TSMC due to switching away from Samsung.</p><blockquote><p>We entered into several long-term supply agreements, under which we made advance payments of $1.64 billion this quarter and will make future payments of $1.79 billion. Outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply obligations were $6.90 billion, inclusive of the $1.79 billion, up from $2.57 billion a year earlier and up from $4.79 billion in the prior quarter.</p><p>Colette Kress &#8211; Nvidia CFO</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><blockquote><p>First of all, we have secured guaranteed supply, very large amounts of it, quite a spectacular amount of it from the world's leading foundry in substrate and packaging and testing certain companies, the integral part of our supply chain.</p><p>Jensen Huang &#8211; Nvidia CEO </p></blockquote><p>Qualcomm has played this relationship masterfully, but they have also had a recent misstep. Qualcomm has long since produced many of their low end and midrange SOCs at Samsung, but in 2020, they moved the flagship Snapdragon 800 line to Samsung. A long-speculated item is that Samsung used more Qualcomm SOCs in their smartphones due to their use of Samsung foundry.</p><p>This was a great arrangement up until just recently where MediaTek came roaring back. <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/mediatek-officially-enters-the-flagship">In July, SemiAnalysis exclusively detailed MediaTek&#8217;s usage of N4 for a new flagship SOC.</a> We detailed the exact CPU configuration and cache details many months before MediaTek&#8217;s own announcement. At the time we believed that MediaTek may take the Android CPU crown away from Qualcomm, and that seems to have come true. Benchmarks show MediaTek has a 17% MT performance advantage and a 34% power efficiency advantage on the CPU.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42feb3b6-f1de-4ed6-b7c4-4a7a0a35a2f0_1024x588.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42feb3b6-f1de-4ed6-b7c4-4a7a0a35a2f0_1024x588.png" width="1024" height="588" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/42feb3b6-f1de-4ed6-b7c4-4a7a0a35a2f0_1024x588.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:588,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42feb3b6-f1de-4ed6-b7c4-4a7a0a35a2f0_1024x588.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42feb3b6-f1de-4ed6-b7c4-4a7a0a35a2f0_1024x588.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42feb3b6-f1de-4ed6-b7c4-4a7a0a35a2f0_1024x588.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42feb3b6-f1de-4ed6-b7c4-4a7a0a35a2f0_1024x588.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Qualcomm uses the same stock Arm cores as MediaTek and has also recognized the performance deficit was coming. As such they are doing something completely unprecedented by switching nodes mid-generation. The S8G1, 2022 flagship SOC, is currently on a Samsung node, but mid-year 2022, they will release a version that is on TSMC&#8217;s N4 process node. This will allow all efficiency and performance deficits to be reclaimed. H1 will be a tough comparison for them due to this loss in the CPU category. Of course, heterogenous compute reigns supreme and Qualcomm has a better chip outside this, but they had to scramble. In 2023, Qualcomm will move the entire high end and flagship lineups to TSMC entirely.</p><p>Qualcomm has ~$13B of purchase obligations. This number can&#8217;t be directly compared to Nvidia&#8217;s, but it is a mammoth one. <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/qualcomm-rffe-business-continues">A large portion of these go to Qualcomm&#8217;s RFFE suppliers as they are growing this business in a titanic way.</a> A portion also goes to UMC and PSMC, but TSMC is forcing Qualcomm to sign long term agreements as well.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Before moving onto Intel, we will briefly touch on Broadcom. Broadcom has a diverse supply chain and they use multiple foundries including internal for RFFE, but TSMC is the primary foundry. Broadcom is one of TSMC&#8217;s largest customers, but Broadcom is also the slowest growing amongst the large customers. The slow growth is contrary to the fact that Broadcom is operating in the two fastest growth verticals in the semiconductor industry, networking and RFFE.</p><p>Broadcom is losing share in both, and a portion of it has to do with their capacity arrangements. They have been extremely tepid to increase capacity massively and demand absurd margins for their products. Broadcom&#8217;s technology is fantastic in many niche&#8217;s, but they are slowly being eroded. Future supply growth for Broadcom at TSMC is not that large, and they are making little to no pre-payments for leading edge N5 and N3 capacity. Broadcom is the financial machine who wants good deals on the front end and resells to their clients at very favorable terms. Broadcom has implemented non-cancellation terms into many of their product segments.</p><p>Now, onto Intel. Let&#8217;s start by dispelling this fiction that Intel is buying up capacity to stiff AMD. AMD is getting the capacity they want from TSMC, on the time frame they want. Another fact, Bob Swan has long since agreed to some very large deals. This deal included capacity at N6, N5/4, and N3. This is nothing new.</p><p>TSMC is smart, calculated, and is playing the long game. Yes, TSMC could be helping Intel get back on the horse as Intel works through internal process node issues. TSMC has a longer-term vision, where only they can supply leading edge capacity. In 2022 and 2023, Qualcomm and Nvidia recognize this fully, but are keeping Samsung in the back pocket for the future. They want to do the same to Intel.</p><p>As Intel has moved to more industry standard SOC design flows, the ability for them to design to different process nodes increases. Bob Swan kept using the word &#8220;optionality&#8221; for the change. Intel is keeping their core IP blocks portable and even designing them to multiple processes. Their roadmap includes chiplets on in-house and external processes. There is a battle brewing with Intel on internal process versus external.</p><p>TSMC wants to convert the Intel internal design and product teams to choosing TSMC nodes despite the lower margins. These teams have mostly used Intel nodes for majority of their history despite having external manufacturing account for 20% of total wafer supply. If TSMC can convince Intel design and product organizations that their nodes are better, they can cut the throat of Intel&#8217;s in-house manufacturing.</p><p>Pat Gelsinger has obviously pitched a very different story. He has been investing heavily in manufacturing and is even pushing a foundry service story. SemiAnalysis can confirm that Intel has stopped selling old tools into the market as they will be preserving older node capacity that they cannot transition. While the deals Bob Swan signed are very much binding and do include some pretty harsh terms to prevent cancellation, the long-term story is quite different.</p><blockquote><p>But let's get to '25 and '26, and we say we've overshot a little bit. I have 3 uses for that spare capacity. One is go get more market share, right? If I have leadership products and leadership process, I'm going to do so with good margins. Gain market share back. Second is, I've also built into our business model that we use foundries, right, external foundries as well. So if I have too much capacity, I'm going to pull wafers back from the external foundries and run them internally at better margins. Third, I go win more foundry customers. So I have -- and these are good margin foundry customers as well, just like we're seeing in the leading edge foundry market. So in the off chance that I have any spare capacity, I have 3 tremendous uses of that, that are highly margin and capital and cash flow efficient as well. So to me, those concerns, right, I lust after the day that one of those might actually materialize.</p><p>Pat Gelsinger &#8211; Intel CEO</p></blockquote><p>What is the current Intel TSMC deal? What did Bob Swan sign? How much capacity does Intel have at TSMC in 2023 and 2024? What products will they be moving to external nodes? What about other clients and their capacity arrangements?</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/tsmc-the-drug-dealer-is-trying-to?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/tsmc-the-drug-dealer-is-trying-to?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p>These sorts of questions will be answered in the subscriber only section.</p><p>Pat&#8217;s trip to Taiwan was quite interesting to say the least.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Give a gift subscription&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&amp;gift=true"><span>Give a gift subscription</span></a></p>

Bringing memory on die helps reduce the IO needs by reducing communications overhead, but at the end of the day, this is a limited avenue of scaling. The processor must transact with the external world to send and receive data. Moore's law has had the industry increasing transistor densities roughly 2x every 2 years, but the rate of IO data rates have only been 2x every 4 years. Over the decades, this delta in transistor density vs IO data rates has diverged massively. <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/intels-trojan-horse-into-the-foundry">Co-packaged optics is but one solution to this issue and it doesn&#8217;t come alone.</a></p><p>Fundamentally chips need to accommodate more points of communication or IO in order to keep up.

This means that each unit of IO is 150 to 200 microns apart on the bottom side side of a die. There has been some incremental improvement here with TSMC N7 bringing bump pitch down to 130-micron and Intel&#8217;s 10nm bringing bump pitch down to 100-micron. These are advancements are called fine pitch flip chip. Not to belittle these advancements, as they are huge enablers of better processors, but the packaging technology in 2000 is essentially the same as that of 2021.</p><p>A 250mm2 die from 2000 versus a 250mm2 die from 2022 has incredibly different transistor counts, capabilities, and of course costs. A Moore&#8217;s law type doubling every 2 years would say there is a &gt;2,000x increase in transistors. Obviously, reality isn&#8217;t that favorable, but the transistor increase is still orders of magnitude larger. On the flip side of the coin, packaging has not enjoyed the same level of increases.</p><p>AMD has gone from ~200-micron bump pitch to 130-micron on TSMC&#8217;s N7 node, only 2.35x more IO. As mentioned earlier, Intel has achieved a bit more scaling by going from ~200-micron bump pitch to 100-micron on 10nm. This still only yields them a 4x increase in IO. The 2.35x or 4x increase is a rounding error relative to transistor count increases.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa49a8aec-a309-42df-8885-08e1d92dec55_1024x765.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa49a8aec-a309-42df-8885-08e1d92dec55_1024x765.png" width="1024" height="765" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a49a8aec-a309-42df-8885-08e1d92dec55_1024x765.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:765,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa49a8aec-a309-42df-8885-08e1d92dec55_1024x765.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa49a8aec-a309-42df-8885-08e1d92dec55_1024x765.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa49a8aec-a309-42df-8885-08e1d92dec55_1024x765.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa49a8aec-a309-42df-8885-08e1d92dec55_1024x765.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>This brings about the concept of a pad limited design.

But I'd also say some might argue, well, let's go build most of those auto chips are on old nodes. Don't we need some old fabs for old nodes? Do we want to invest in our past or do we want to invest in the future?</p><p>A new fab takes 4 or 5 years to build and have production worthy.

The unit cost economics don&#8217;t work here due to the higher cost per mm2 because chip area does not scale well due to being pad limited. Beyond these costs, there are also high one time costs due to having to redesign ancient chips on the newer node and entire recertification process.

More area means more space for IO. Not the best route, but designers will frequently increase memory on die which allows for more data to be stored on die. This in turn decreases IO needs to an extent. AMD's recent architectures are a great example of this due to their huge caches on both CPUs and GPUs.</p><p>AMD brands this as Infinity Cache. The solution is by providing large pools of on die SRAM to store the most computationally relevant data in the processor and therefore reduce memory bandwidth requirements. In the GPU world, AMD explicitly stated they were able to reduce the GDDR6 bus size from 384 bit to 256 bit by adding infinity cache. <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/apple-a15-die-shot-and-annotation">Apple has also been aggressive on this front by stuffing tons of cache on their in house designed processors.</a> A component of these design choices is related to power, but a large portion is also due to pad limitations.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f0e9d86-0b29-4bfe-978b-489021387f2c_1024x554.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f0e9d86-0b29-4bfe-978b-489021387f2c_1024x554.jpeg" width="1024" height="554" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4f0e9d86-0b29-4bfe-978b-489021387f2c_1024x554.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:554,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f0e9d86-0b29-4bfe-978b-489021387f2c_1024x554.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f0e9d86-0b29-4bfe-978b-489021387f2c_1024x554.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f0e9d86-0b29-4bfe-978b-489021387f2c_1024x554.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f0e9d86-0b29-4bfe-978b-489021387f2c_1024x554.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Another avenue is adding various application specific circuits to improve chip efficiency.

Morgan Stanley justified this by including a laughable chart that showed transistor costs on 5nm being lower than 7nm. This in stark contrast to industry experts. Cost per transistor stalled with the introduction of FinFET nodes, 7nm completely plateaued, and with 5nm they are higher than ever before. Our readers can do the math, N7 wafers are ~$9,500 and N5 wafers are ~$16,000. Apple&#8217;s die size barely fell, yet they paid up.</p></blockquote><p>So cost per transistor is still increasing, but the demand for compute is increasing more than ever. We turn to heterogeneous architectures to fight back, but now the silicon design process is much more difficult. The industry must rely on many teams with different IP delivering on time and integrating it all together. EDA vendors such as Synopsys and Cadence do a fantastic job assisting, but it&#8217;s not enough. An open ecosystem where one can purchase application specific IP or silicon and integrate it into their hardware design is necessary for anyone who doesn&#8217;t have a &gt;10M units use case. Even for those firms, a chiplet style system architecture is the answer.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce1be050-b76c-46b3-a120-2cdb5fc43d88_1024x768.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce1be050-b76c-46b3-a120-2cdb5fc43d88_1024x768.jpeg" width="1024" height="768" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ce1be050-b76c-46b3-a120-2cdb5fc43d88_1024x768.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:768,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce1be050-b76c-46b3-a120-2cdb5fc43d88_1024x768.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce1be050-b76c-46b3-a120-2cdb5fc43d88_1024x768.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce1be050-b76c-46b3-a120-2cdb5fc43d88_1024x768.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce1be050-b76c-46b3-a120-2cdb5fc43d88_1024x768.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">AMD Rome/Milan</figcaption></figure></div><p>As we continue to shrink, the expectation is that yields slowly fall. This is a logical conclusion because each successive node adds ~35% more process steps. When leading edge processes measure in the thousands of processes steps, errors start to stack up quickly. Industrial firms love to talk up "Six Sigma", but that isn&#8217;t enough for semiconductor manufacturing. Let&#8217;s take a hypothetical process with 2,000 process steps and each step is 6 sigmas in terms of defects per cm2. Then the D0 (industry term for defect rate per cm2) would end up being 0.678. The larger the die, the more likely it is to have defects.</p><p>If this hypothetical process was building Intel&#8217;s top end server CPU, Ice Lake. This would result in 4 good dies per wafer and 76 defective ones. Now consider this analysis was done on the cm2 level and there are billions of transistors per cm2 on leading edge process nodes. The semiconductor industry is way better than six sigma.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>What&#8217;s the solution other than perfection on the scale of picometers?</p><p>Chiplets! Breaking large chips into many small ones.</p><p>AMD is the most popular example of this, but it is a trend across the industry. AMD can design 3 chips, a CPU core chiplet, and 2 IO dies. These 3 designs cover huge portion of the market. Meanwhile, Intel designs 2 Alder Lake desktop chips, and 3 Ice Lake server chips to serve the same addressable markets. So, AMD gets to save on design costs, build CPUs with more cores than Intel, and save money on yields.</p><p>To demonstrate the yield argument, see the table below. AMD splits the CPU cores across 8 CPU core chiplets. If yields were 100%, Intel would be able to manufacture cores at a lower cost per CPU core than AMD. But instead, Intel must spend more per CPU core because larger chips have more defects. There are a few glaring caveats with the table below, with the biggest being the assumption that there is 0 harvesting of defective dies and that Intel and TSMC have the same D0. Neither of those assumptions are true, and this exercise is for demonstrative purposes.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45b8546f-dd0c-45a1-a01a-25a93539f037_1024x542.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45b8546f-dd0c-45a1-a01a-25a93539f037_1024x542.png" width="1024" height="542" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/45b8546f-dd0c-45a1-a01a-25a93539f037_1024x542.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:542,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45b8546f-dd0c-45a1-a01a-25a93539f037_1024x542.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45b8546f-dd0c-45a1-a01a-25a93539f037_1024x542.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45b8546f-dd0c-45a1-a01a-25a93539f037_1024x542.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45b8546f-dd0c-45a1-a01a-25a93539f037_1024x542.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Chiplets are great, but it&#8217;s not the solution in isolation.

Some would argue it isn&#8217;t even advanced packaging, but those folks are terribly mistaken. Going back to Apple as an example, they will have TSMC take an application processor die and package it with denser bumps on the order of 90-micron to 60-micron onto a reconstituted or carrier wafer/panel. This is roughly 8x higher bump density versus traditional flip chip packaging.</p><p>This reconstituted or carrier wafer/panel then spreads out the IO further, hence the name fan out. The fanout package is then be attached to a motherboard. The silicon die can be designed with less concerns about becoming pad limited because pads are smaller on a fan out. This package can also have DRAM memory, NAND storage, and PMICs packaged on it. Integrated fan outs are not only great for density, but they also keep a lot of the inter-chip IO on the package. This IO would otherwise have to interface through the motherboard at much larger IO pitch sizes.</p><p>Integrated fan outs are becoming increasingly common for high performance applications, not only mobile. The fastest growing use cases are on the networking side of things where designs have been pad limited for over a decade. AMD will be adopting fan outs quite aggressively in their server CPUs and GPUs. <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/tesla-dojo-unique-packaging-and-chip">Tesla Dojo 1</a> is another high-profile example of integrated fan out packaging, but on a wafer scale. <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/tesla-ai-day-supercomputer-chip-teaser">SemiAnalysis leaked that Tesla would use this packaging type before the announcement by the way</a>.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52c3d881-4620-45bb-899a-721b3f433b6b_1024x545.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52c3d881-4620-45bb-899a-721b3f433b6b_1024x545.png" width="1024" height="545" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/52c3d881-4620-45bb-899a-721b3f433b6b_1024x545.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:545,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52c3d881-4620-45bb-899a-721b3f433b6b_1024x545.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52c3d881-4620-45bb-899a-721b3f433b6b_1024x545.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52c3d881-4620-45bb-899a-721b3f433b6b_1024x545.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52c3d881-4620-45bb-899a-721b3f433b6b_1024x545.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Within advanced packaging, there is 2.5D and 3D packaging. 2.5D involves silicon packaged on top of other silicon, but the lower silicon die is dedicated to routing and has no active transistors.

This subverts the IO issue while also allowing for much tighter integration.</p><p>A few more examples of 2.5D include Intel EMIB based products, Xilinx FPGA&#8217;s, AMD&#8217;s newest datacenter GPU, and <a href="https://semianalysis.substack.com/p/amazon-graviton-3-uses-chiplets-and">Amazon Graviton 3.</a></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14383844-678e-4767-80c0-57c1a0d7a25e_1024x576.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14383844-678e-4767-80c0-57c1a0d7a25e_1024x576.jpeg" width="1024" height="576" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/14383844-678e-4767-80c0-57c1a0d7a25e_1024x576.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:576,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14383844-678e-4767-80c0-57c1a0d7a25e_1024x576.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14383844-678e-4767-80c0-57c1a0d7a25e_1024x576.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14383844-678e-4767-80c0-57c1a0d7a25e_1024x576.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14383844-678e-4767-80c0-57c1a0d7a25e_1024x576.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Nvidia A100</figcaption></figure></div><p>3D packaging is taking an active die and packaging it on top of another active die. This was initially shipped with logic silicon at 55-micron pitches by Intel, but volume use cases will be at 36-micron and lower. TSMC and AMD will be shipping 3d stacked V-cache at a 17-micron pitch. This technology moves from bumps to through silicon vias (TSVs), and it has much more room to scale.</p><p>Other applications such as CMOS image sensors manufactured by Sony are already at 6.3-micron pitch. To keep the comparisons going, 36-micron pitch is 31x higher bump density, copper TSVs implemented at a 17-micron pitch would be 138x higher IO density, and CMOS image sensors by Sony are at 6.3-micron pitch are 567x higher IO density versus standard flip chip.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2248a9b0-1a29-47cb-aef2-1cfe1191bb67_943x1024.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2248a9b0-1a29-47cb-aef2-1cfe1191bb67_943x1024.png" width="943" height="1024" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2248a9b0-1a29-47cb-aef2-1cfe1191bb67_943x1024.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:943,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2248a9b0-1a29-47cb-aef2-1cfe1191bb67_943x1024.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2248a9b0-1a29-47cb-aef2-1cfe1191bb67_943x1024.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2248a9b0-1a29-47cb-aef2-1cfe1191bb67_943x1024.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2248a9b0-1a29-47cb-aef2-1cfe1191bb67_943x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Sony 2017 IEDM CMOS Image Sensor TSVs</figcaption></figure></div><p>That was just a basic explanation of the major types of packaging, but we will delve deeper into the different types in this series. There are quite a few different bets companies have made on future packaging types, tools, and from which tool vendors. The equipment and IP side of things has a lot more excitement than people assume at first glance, but the basics need to be explained before we can delve deeper.</p><p>There are a lot of investable ideas and angles for this coming sea of innovation.
