The other question will be whether other countries even need to follow suit since many private firms are already effectively self-sanctioning Russian oil purchases to both avoid the uncertainty, headache, and acutely elevated risk associated with handling these barrels right now.</strong></p><div><hr></div><p><em><strong>Clicking the LIKE button is one of the best ways to support my research.</strong></em></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Oil Bullish on the Streets, Bearish in the Forecast Sheets]]></title><description><![CDATA[Looking at the gap between oil market sentiment and monitoring agency outlooks]]></description><link>https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/oil-bullish-streets-bearish-forecast-sheets</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/oil-bullish-streets-bearish-forecast-sheets</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Rory Johnston]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 08 Feb 2022 15:14:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0513470-3726-455c-a37c-1856b68b11da_4749x2711.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0513470-3726-455c-a37c-1856b68b11da_4749x2711.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0513470-3726-455c-a37c-1856b68b11da_4749x2711.png" width="1456" height="831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d0513470-3726-455c-a37c-1856b68b11da_4749x2711.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:831,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:973506,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0513470-3726-455c-a37c-1856b68b11da_4749x2711.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0513470-3726-455c-a37c-1856b68b11da_4749x2711.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0513470-3726-455c-a37c-1856b68b11da_4749x2711.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0513470-3726-455c-a37c-1856b68b11da_4749x2711.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><ul><li><p><strong>Despite widely bullish crude sentiment, the major monitoring agencies expect oil market pressures to ease over the coming months and conditions to flip, at least temporarily, into surplus through 2022.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Five common assumptions can be seen as driving these more bearish forecasts: 1) rebounding US shale, 2) further unwinding of COVID-era OPEC+ cuts, 3) all-time high production for non-OPEC producers outside the US and Russia, 4) unchanged Iranian and Venezuelan oil sanctions, and 5) a complete post-pandemic demand recovery.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Together these assumptions suggest that market sentiment may be getting ahead of itself relative to the fundamental outlooks of the major monitoring agencies.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>If the future oil market does turn out to be tighter than the agencies&#8217; forecasts, it&#8217;ll come down to one of the five common assumptions being wrong (e.g., shale stalls out, OPEC+ falls further behind, etc.).</strong></p></li></ul><p>Oil prices are above $90 per barrel for the first time since 2014, and the bulls are feeling validated. Few are saying that oil <em><strong>could </strong></em>hit $100 per barrel anymore&#8212;it&#8217;s more or less assumed that it will at some point through 2022&#8212;while the <em><strong>could </strong></em>has shifted to $150 or even $200 per barrel targets.</p><p>It&#8217;s not hard to see why: prices are experiencing a historic rally, visible crude inventories are plunging, OPEC+ has repeatedly missed its planned production additions, US tight oil production remains well below pre-pandemic levels, and demand growth continues to be robust.</p><p>But while boom followed COVID bust, all three major global oil market monitoring agencies continue to forecast a return of at least temporary (OPEC) if not longer-lasting (EIA/IEA) oversupply conditions. This chasm between financial outlooks and the monitoring agencies&#8217; forecasts leaves considerable room for debate.</p><p>So, what <em><strong>exactly</strong></em> are we debating? With crude prices this volatile and a near-certain tidal wave of oil-related headlines coming our way over the coming months, I think it&#8217;s helpful to understand what <em><strong>specific </strong></em>assumptions the monitoring agencies are making to arrive at their relatively bearish&#8212;or at least less bullish<em>&#8212;</em>market outlooks.</p><p>These forecasters are all relying on five common assumptions: 1) a decisive bounce-back in US tight oil production, 2) that OPEC+ manages to return most but not all of its planned barrels, 3) that non-OPEC+ producers outside the US see all-time high output on the back of growth (e.g., Canada, Brazil, and Guyana), 4) there&#8217;s no major movement on Iranian or Venezuelan oil sanctions, and 5) that demand returns to pre-COVID levels but growth gradually begins to slow again as base effects wear off.</p><p>In this piece, I&#8217;ll look <em><strong>very briefly</strong></em> at each of these common assumptions, with the intention of digging into certain ones more deeply over the coming weeks. I do want to emphasize that these are <em><strong>not my forecasts</strong></em> because I don&#8217;t currently publish forecasts, but keep your eyes peeled for more coming this year! And while I think the collective forecast is notably more bearish than the sentiment I&#8217;m observing, it is far from a call for crude prices to collapse&#8212;more like an easing of upside pressures with the possibility of a very modest step back.</p><p><em>For this analysis, I&#8217;ll be digging into the forecasts of OPEC (the <a href="https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/publications/338.htm">Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR)</a>) and the EIA (the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/">Short Term Energy Outlook (STEO)</a>) because these are both publicly available and free.

The expanded producer group very literally saved the oil market at the beginning of the pandemic, cutting collective output by 9.7 MMbpd to offset lockdown-related demand losses. The return of that near 10% of global supply has been top of mind&#8212;and we&#8217;re getting close but not quite to pre-pandemic levels.</p><p>The EIA forecasts that OPEC crude oil production will rise a further 1.4 MMbpd through 2022 but will stop about 1 MMbpd short of fully unwinding its full contribution to the OPEC+ cuts (my thanks to the EIA STEO team for actually publishing a forecast for OPEC crude output). This forecast is a reasonable middle ground between fears of OPEC quickly running out of spare capacity and the demonstrated challenges in lifting crude output in OPEC members like Nigeria and Angola that are unlikely to return to previous production levels anytime soon.</p><p>Russia was the other major component of the market-saving OPEC+ deal, accounting for 2.5 MMbpd of the initially committed 9.7 MMbpd, and both OPEC and the EIA expect Russian production to reach all-time highs through 2022 as the OPEC+ deal wraps up.

Of course, there are more pressing immediate concerns, like OPEC+ meetings or the latest COVID variant, and more existential long-term questions about climate mitigation policy and accelerated demand destruction.</p><p>But by the time we get to the end of next year and into 2023, we are hopefully going to see demand growing at a reasonably brisk organic pace once again. OPEC+ will have completely unwound COVID-era production cuts, leaving a very thin buffer of spare capacity. The incremental supply torch will then pass to non-OPEC+ producers, the most prolific of which is obviously the US shale patch. Sure, we can expect modest growth from Canada, Brazil, Guyana, etc., but the US accounted for the bulk of pre-COVID oil production growth and it will remain the heaviest lifter outside OPEC+ going forward.</p><p>You see, it was not that long ago that the unrelenting growth of US tight oil production was an anvil around the neck of the oil market. The $40-60 &#8220;shale band&#8221; felt increasingly like an iron law, at least for any period stretching longer than a month or two. If prices rose above that $60 per barrel threshold&#8212;and even often when they didn&#8217;t&#8212;US shale production would grow output at a truly voracious pace. Over the course of 2018, total US crude production grew by a truly staggering 2 million barrels per day (MMbpd), alone adding nearly twice the total global demand growth that year.</p><p>Easy come, easy go, however. US crude output fell by about 2 MMbpd in 2020 to an average of 11 MMbpd. That quick reaction time in response to collapsing prices is part of what makes US tight oil production so disruptive and, theoretically, self-regulating&#8212;an economic swing-producer of sorts, but tracking prices via quick-return investments and quick-decline wells rather than by government fiat. (To be clear, Saudi Arabia and to a lesser extent allied countries within OPEC+ are the only true &#8220;swing producers&#8221; within the current market, because their production can be explicitly modulated by policymakers.)</p><p>Today&#8217;s issue is that we have not seen the type of bounce back that would have been expected from the pre-pandemic shale patch. US production is only up to around 11.5 MMbpd, which is a recovery of barely one-quarter of its COVID losses despite WTI spending a solid month above $80 per barrel. This lackluster shale recovery is also why I feel that the Biden administration&#8217;s efforts to talk/press down the price of crude will be ultimately <a href="https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/lower-oil-prices-pyrrhic-victory">self-defeating</a>. The Black Friday $10 per barrel oil price rout only makes this needed US producer recovery that much more challenging.</p><p><em>For ease, all US production statistics here refer to crude oil rather that total liquids. Virtually all the data behind the charts and discussion in this piece have been taken from the EIA&#8217;s Drilling Productivity Report (DPR), a high-level model of US basin-level oil &amp; gas production efficiency trends. This data is far from perfect but provides a great first look at differences within the US oil &amp; gas recovery&#8212;I hope to follow up this analysis with further, more detailed drill downs (every pun intended).</em></p><h3><strong>Permian Basin and the Rest</strong></h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b097f79-68dc-4bb5-a710-d4e4ba753cae_4749x2711.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b097f79-68dc-4bb5-a710-d4e4ba753cae_4749x2711.png" width="1456" height="831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8b097f79-68dc-4bb5-a710-d4e4ba753cae_4749x2711.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:831,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:906695,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b097f79-68dc-4bb5-a710-d4e4ba753cae_4749x2711.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b097f79-68dc-4bb5-a710-d4e4ba753cae_4749x2711.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b097f79-68dc-4bb5-a710-d4e4ba753cae_4749x2711.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b097f79-68dc-4bb5-a710-d4e4ba753cae_4749x2711.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>In aggregate, the US shale patch production recovery has notably underperformed the recovery in crude prices. Whether that lackluster recovery has been driven by the fabled &#8220;producer cashflow discipline&#8221;, regulatory burden, or ubiquitous supply chain challenges is a question for a different day but we&#8217;ve already seen a considerable regional differentiation. The US shale patch is far from a monolith: in the Permian basin, for example, producers are setting fresh all-time highs, while the rest of the oil-dominant shale regions remain down 20-30%.</p><p>The EIA DPR reports on 7 major tight oil and gas regions, which each produce a varying mixture of oil and gas (see map at the top). Based on the mixture of hydrocarbons yielded, it&#8217;s useful to split these regions into two groups: the 5 oil-dominant regions of Permian, Eagle Ford, Bakken, Niobrara, and Anadarko and the 2 gas-dominant regions of Appalachia and Haynesville. While 45% of natural gas production does come from oil-dominant basins, less than 2% of oil production comes from gas-dominant basins; for the purposes of this oil-focused discussion, we&#8217;ll mostly be leaving Appalachia and Haynesville for another day.</p><p>So, what gives in the Permian Basin? If you look closely at the above chart, we can see that Permian oil production has considerably outpaced the recovery in drilling rigs. Part of what we&#8217;re seeing is a genuine increase in rig productivity similar to what we&#8217;ve seen in previous market routs: as prices fall and rigs are idled, the best remaining rigs and crews become concentrated in the best geological acreage. But another important ingredient is that the implied rig productivity in the Permian basin is being juiced by the depletion of drilled but uncompleted (DUC) well inventory.</p><h3><strong>What the DUC?</strong></h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe519a411-930e-40f2-abca-4f169baf82ac_4749x2711.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe519a411-930e-40f2-abca-4f169baf82ac_4749x2711.png" width="1456" height="831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e519a411-930e-40f2-abca-4f169baf82ac_4749x2711.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:831,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:875969,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe519a411-930e-40f2-abca-4f169baf82ac_4749x2711.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe519a411-930e-40f2-abca-4f169baf82ac_4749x2711.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe519a411-930e-40f2-abca-4f169baf82ac_4749x2711.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe519a411-930e-40f2-abca-4f169baf82ac_4749x2711.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The state of US tight oil production is actually worse than it first appears. Current production rates, especially where we&#8217;re seeing any tangible recovery (i.e., the Permian basin), are being subsidized by a rapid depletion of DUC inventory.</p><p>Drilled but uncompleted wells are a function of the fact that the US shale production process has two major steps: (1) a well is drilled with a drilling rig and then (2) it is &#8220;completed&#8221; by a different team (i.e., the actual fracking part) after which it begins to produce marketable crude. When drilling runs ahead of completions as it largely did through 2017-19, the industry accumulates a sizable mountain of this potential production. These DUCs were yet one more bearish factor weighing on pre-COVID market prospects: even when US drilling declined, producers could lean into their DUC inventory to keep production humming along despite weaker rig activity.</p><p>And in the 2020 downturn, this is exactly what happened. Rigs across all regions were idled and production collapsed. When the industry began revving up again near the end of Summer 2020, completions ran <em>well </em>ahead of drilling, drawing down that fracklog&#8212;er, backlog&#8212;at a record pace. This DUC drawdown, especially in the Permian basin, essentially subsidizes still-weak drilling activity, making rigs seem <em>even more</em> productive.</p><p><strong>Drilling remains down, if not non-existent, across all oil-dominant regions of the US shale patch, even in the Permian Basin where producers are technically setting fresh all-time production highs. This means that the current medium-term prospects for US shale production are lackluster to say the least barring a material acceleration in rig activity. And this is amidst favorable price conditions begging the question of what it will take for US producers to put in the investments required to contribute significant additional supply to the global oil market over the next year.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sorry, Biden: Lower Oil Prices Today Would be a Pyrrhic Victory]]></title><description><![CDATA[Neither Increased OPEC+ production nor SPR releases are a durable answer to high pump prices]]></description><link>https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/lower-oil-prices-pyrrhic-victory</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/lower-oil-prices-pyrrhic-victory</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Rory Johnston]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 17:15:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F932d3ad5-93b5-40a2-944b-031d542e09df_4749x2711.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F932d3ad5-93b5-40a2-944b-031d542e09df_4749x2711.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F932d3ad5-93b5-40a2-944b-031d542e09df_4749x2711.png" width="1456" height="831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/932d3ad5-93b5-40a2-944b-031d542e09df_4749x2711.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:831,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1047026,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F932d3ad5-93b5-40a2-944b-031d542e09df_4749x2711.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F932d3ad5-93b5-40a2-944b-031d542e09df_4749x2711.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F932d3ad5-93b5-40a2-944b-031d542e09df_4749x2711.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F932d3ad5-93b5-40a2-944b-031d542e09df_4749x2711.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><ul><li><p><strong>To blunt rising prices at the pump, the White House has repeatedly called on OPEC+ to accelerate production additions; but these calls are misguided.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>OPEC+ isn&#8217;t likely to lift production given longer-term outlooks, with the group generally favouring market stability over short-term price management, and already [admittedly optimistically] forecasting supply surpluses in the months ahead.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>US tight oil production&#8212;the largest source of non-OPEC+ pre-pandemic growth&#8212;is rebounding from the pandemic downturn at a far slower pace than expected, especially given the currently elevated price environment.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The production trajectory of the US shale patch is the single-biggest question in the oil market today and, frankly, prices at or above their current level are likely needed to incentivize the non-OPEC+ production investment we&#8217;re going to need as OPEC+ cuts roll off through end-2022.</strong></p></li></ul><p>Oil prices are pretty high right now.

The Kingdom is the longest-term oil supplier imaginable, with massive, cheap-to-produce reserves and, therefore, is motivated less by the price of oil today or tomorrow as by the price of oil over the next two decades. Using this lens, Saudi Arabia&#8212;acting through OPEC+&#8212;generally prioritizes market stability, looking to avoid prices that are high enough to accelerate long-term demand destruction.</p><p>So, wouldn&#8217;t Saudi Arabia want to increase production to help lower prices (as the What House has been demanding)? Not necessarily. It is with this long-term lens that Riyadh&#8217;s approach to managing a historic crisis can be understood; the oil market likely needs higher prices today to ensure adequate supply and contain price volatility for the period <em>after</em> OPEC+ has wound down its emergency cut.</p><p>There&#8217;s also the small matter of a seasonal surplus over the coming months expected by most major forecasters, including OPEC+, as seen in the chart above. However, for the purposes of this discussion, that seasonal oversupply just accentuates the price effect that I&#8217;m discussing. The same thing can be said about the White House&#8217;s pivot toward potential strategic petroleum reserve releases from the US and allied countries: the market just doesn&#8217;t need more crude right now.</p><p><strong>Shale?

Far and away the largest source of non-OPEC+ pre-pandemic growth, production in the US fell by 2-3 MMbpd during the opening weeks of the pandemic and remains depressed despite the price of crude reaching its highest level since the 2014 collapse. The US is currently producing 11.5 MMbpd of crude, still 1.6 MMbpd below its February 2020 peak.</p><p>Where production in the US shale patch goes from here is the single-biggest question faced by the oil market today. In the past, it was common to refer to a $40-60 per barrel &#8220;shale band&#8221; (credit to <a href="https://twitter.com/petromatrix">PetroMatrix</a>) inside of which oil prices would bounce around. Lower than $40, shale investment would slow, decline rates would take hold, and production would contract. Higher than $60/bbl, US production would accelerate to a point where gains would swamp demand growth and prices would be forced lower.</p><p>We&#8217;re clearly well above $60/bbl today and US production is rising at a far slower pace than one would expect&#8212;and from a materially depressed base. Oil-directed rig counts are still one-third lower than they were before COVID. And while the efficiency of those online rigs has improved, US producers have been forced to draw down a large backlog of drilled but uncompleted wells (aka &#8220;DUCs&#8221;) to subsidize the lack of drilling.</p><p>Much has been made of these US tight oil producers finding the religion of cashflow discipline after a decade of profligate spending. A less flattering interpretation is that US producers are simply facing the same supply chain bottlenecks as the rest of the economy and it&#8217;s kneecapping any potential efforts to lift production. In reality, it&#8217;s likely a sticky combination of both tight purse strings and tight supply chains.</p><p>Despite this lackluster bounce back to date, all major forecasting agencies now expect US oil production growth to average nearly 1 MMbpd in 2022. Given current [un]responsiveness, that expected target feels unlikely to be met absent continued high prices, which brings us back to why OPEC+ is happy enough with the current stronger-priced environment.</p><p><strong>Expect OPEC+ to continue supporting a reasonably high oil price over the coming months given confidence in their established recovery strategy and a desire for market stability. Meanwhile, the big question continues to be around non-OPEC+ producer investment, particularly in the US shale patch. US shale continues to recover post-pandemic but at a disappointing rate, especially given the current price environment. Biden likely won&#8217;t see any relief for Americans at the pumps in the short-term&#8212;but that&#8217;s good because any short-term release likely yields longer-term pain.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Canadian Crude Discount Rising Anew]]></title><description><![CDATA[Growing differential borne by Canadian heavy barrels is more about quality than pipelines this time]]></description><link>https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/wcs-diff-rising-anew</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/wcs-diff-rising-anew</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Rory Johnston]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:10:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4a71f2f-1b48-4525-8a4d-888ec8b8d263_4749x2711.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4a71f2f-1b48-4525-8a4d-888ec8b8d263_4749x2711.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4a71f2f-1b48-4525-8a4d-888ec8b8d263_4749x2711.png" width="1456" height="831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b4a71f2f-1b48-4525-8a4d-888ec8b8d263_4749x2711.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:831,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1967668,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4a71f2f-1b48-4525-8a4d-888ec8b8d263_4749x2711.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4a71f2f-1b48-4525-8a4d-888ec8b8d263_4749x2711.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4a71f2f-1b48-4525-8a4d-888ec8b8d263_4749x2711.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4a71f2f-1b48-4525-8a4d-888ec8b8d263_4749x2711.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><ul><li><p><strong>WCS differentials have widened to a pandemic-era high of more than $21 per barrel under WTI.</strong></p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>While pipeline bottlenecks have typically driven relative WCS value over recent years, the latest widening is more so the result of crude quality preferences.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The generalized heavy oil cheapening appears to be driven by a combination of factors including (i) stronger Canadian production and the start-up of Line 3, (ii) heavier OPEC barrels coming back to market, (iii) higher natural gas prices pushing up the costs associated with refining heavier crudes, and (iv) the US Gulf Coast oil industry&#8217;s uneven recovery from hurricane Ida.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Many heavier crude grades are now trading at wider than pre-pandemic differentials and, while these will likely regain some relative value, this breakdown marks the end of a pandemic goldilocks period for heavier sour crudes defined by tight and uncharacteristically stable spreads.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>In some ways, this is good news for Canadian oil producers because it does not necessitate the reopening of the age-old pipeline debate; however, the bad news is that we can&#8217;t really do anything to change it.</strong></p></li></ul><p>Western Canadian heavy crude is getting cheaper again relative to the North American benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI), but it&#8217;s not for the usual pipeline-related reasons.

The relative value of WCS, like that of all crudes, is driven by a cocktail of factors related to the chemical make-up and geographic location of the barrel. At some point I&#8217;ll do a longer write-up on how this all works, but in brief:</p><p><em><strong>Quality</strong></em>: Different grades of crude vary widely across multiple attributes, but the two main factors are the oil&#8217;s &#8220;gravity&#8221; or density (i.e., light, medium, or heavy) and its sulphur concentration (i.e., sweet or sour). Lighter barrels typically command a premium because they yield a higher proportion of more valuable petroleum products, like gasoline, with less expensive refining techniques. Sweet barrels are also typically preferred since many jurisdictions require that most of a crude&#8217;s sulphur content is removed before reaching consumers (because sulphur is nasty; see: acid rain, respiratory harm, etc.). WCS is an especially heavy, sour crude, which means that it will almost always be worth less than a light, sweet barrel like WTI. That relative value of WCS shifts over time alongside availability of and demand for different grades.</p><p><em><strong>Geography</strong></em>: All oil is priced at a specific location because transporting or storing crude is expensive and complicated. WCS is priced at an oil storage tank terminal in Hardisty, Alberta and WTI is priced nearly 2,200 KM away in Cushing, Oklahoma, with the US Gulf Coast refining hub another 800 KM further down the line (see map). This geographic reality coupled with insufficient pipeline capacity has been the traditional source of heartache for Western Canadian oil producers.</p><p>Over the past decade, whenever production in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) outpaced available takeaway capacity, a glut of crude would get trapped on the Alberta end of the pipes. This would only be resolved when the local prices were sufficiently depressed such that the difference between the price in Hardisty and the desired destination could cover the higher cost of incremental transport (typically, rail). This cycle was most acutely felt in October 2018 when the WCS differential widened to an unprecedented $50/bbl, which ultimately prompted the provincial government to temporarily curtail domestic production to reduce competition for takeaway capacity.</p><p><em>(I was writing a lot about Canadian heavy crude and pipeline bottlenecks back in those days, and it&#8217;s honestly kind of shocking that I haven&#8217;t waxed poetic on Canadian crude differentials until this, my 12th newsletter.)</em></p><h3><strong>Heavy is the Crude that Wears the Discount</strong></h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bd18082-83c7-4919-84f5-9fd4e67c33f0_4749x2711.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bd18082-83c7-4919-84f5-9fd4e67c33f0_4749x2711.png" width="1456" height="831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1bd18082-83c7-4919-84f5-9fd4e67c33f0_4749x2711.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:831,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1511918,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bd18082-83c7-4919-84f5-9fd4e67c33f0_4749x2711.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bd18082-83c7-4919-84f5-9fd4e67c33f0_4749x2711.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bd18082-83c7-4919-84f5-9fd4e67c33f0_4749x2711.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bd18082-83c7-4919-84f5-9fd4e67c33f0_4749x2711.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>So, what&#8217;s happening today? Given the still-fresh pain of the acute 2018 differential blowouts, a widening WCS differential harkens renewed pipeline worries. However, this time WCS&#8217; marketing struggles have much more to do with quality than geography, as evidenced by the simultaneous and equivalent widening of the WCS differential marked in Cushing as well as the US Gulf Coast. Indeed, the implied transportation differential has remained almost entirely stable through this latest bout of widening at around $7 per barrel (see map, &#8220;implied transportation&#8221;). The quality discounting problem seen today is bigger&#8212;more global and more complicated&#8212;than the expected Canadian crude transportation story.</p><p>We&#8217;re seeing similar widening trends across other regional and global crude differentials. At the highest level, the differential between Brent, the light sweet global benchmark, and Dubai, the medium sour benchmark used across most of Asia, recently widened to an 8-year high of more than $5 per barrel. Closer to home, medium sour crudes like Mars and Poseidon at the US Gulf Coast have also sold off relative to their lighter, sweeter counterparts over the past few weeks.</p><p>This heavy crude weakening is being driven by a variety of factors that I&#8217;ll dig deeper into over the coming weeks. First, we&#8217;re seeing strong Canadian production and the start-up of Line 3, Canada&#8217;s first new[ish] pipeline in ages, which facilitates even more heavy crude inflows. At a global level, the return of withheld, predominantly heavier OPEC+ production increases the availability of these heavy crudes, while crisis-level natural gas prices push up the costs associated with refining heavier barrels. This is compounded on a local level as US Gulf Coast refineries continue to struggle to recover after hurricane Ida-related shutdowns, with offshore platforms pumping heavier grades restarting more quickly. Now you have more heavy crude available than the refining market wants to process&#8212;at least at narrow differentials. I also note that some industry players have claimed simple seasonal weakness as refiners switch up their product mix; however, this seasonal weakness hasn&#8217;t really been seen over the past two years.</p><p><strong>The latest bout of WCS differential widening is very much a good news/bad news story for Canadian oil producers. The good news: This (finally) isn&#8217;t a pipeline or Canada-specific problem. Moreover, quality differential widening has much less room to run compared to almost-ceilingless transportation-related discounting. The bad news: there&#8217;s nothing really to be done about the widening from a Canadian industry perspective and it seems to mark the end of a short-lived pandemic goldilocks period for heavy crude differentials. In many ways, the recent weakness of WCS, and heavy crudes more broadly, is yet another post-pandemic return to &#8220;normal&#8221;: WCS&#8217; implied quality differential spent most of the pandemic at an abnormally narrow $2-4 per barrel versus the pre-2020 norm of nearer $5-8 per barrel, though we&#8217;ve now overshot that norm which means we&#8217;re likely to gradually tighten again as markets normalize.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Winter NatGas Inventories: Choose Your Temperature Adventure]]></title><description><![CDATA[Winter temperatures will determine the extent of the drawdown, although structural changes have us trending toward tighter markets in most scenarios]]></description><link>https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/winter-gas-inventories-temperature-adventure</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/winter-gas-inventories-temperature-adventure</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Rory Johnston]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 14:13:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a50d7ac-32f5-4852-9e37-2c2278f56bcc_4749x2711.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a50d7ac-32f5-4852-9e37-2c2278f56bcc_4749x2711.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a50d7ac-32f5-4852-9e37-2c2278f56bcc_4749x2711.png" width="1456" height="831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8a50d7ac-32f5-4852-9e37-2c2278f56bcc_4749x2711.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:831,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1193074,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a50d7ac-32f5-4852-9e37-2c2278f56bcc_4749x2711.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a50d7ac-32f5-4852-9e37-2c2278f56bcc_4749x2711.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a50d7ac-32f5-4852-9e37-2c2278f56bcc_4749x2711.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a50d7ac-32f5-4852-9e37-2c2278f56bcc_4749x2711.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><ul><li><p><strong>Whether it&#8217;s a mild or cold winter will determine much of how North American natural gas markets evolve over the next few months, with more than 1.5 trillion cubic feet of inventory between the two extreme scenarios.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Structurally higher exports and still-recovering domestic production (from the lows of the pandemic) will likely push natural gas inventories to lower than usual levels even in an average winter temperatures scenario, especially after accounting for total system inventory cover.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>In a worst-case-scenario, a particularly cold winter&#8212;like, for example, one on par with the 2013-14 polar vortex&#8212;would significantly deplete inventories, likely driving them to their lowest effective level in over a decade.</strong></p></li></ul><p>North American benchmark Henry hub natural gas prices have had an extremely volatile past month, rising to a 13-year high of more than $6.30 per Million British thermal units (MMBtu) in early October and then retreating to the $5-6/MMBtu range in the weeks since.

These scenarios only vary in their predicted weather patterns: the &#8220;average winter&#8221; uses 10-year seasonal average temperatures, the &#8220;mild winter&#8221; follows the abnormally warm 2011-12 experience, and the &#8220;cold winter&#8221; recreates the bone-chilling 2013-14 polar vortex.</p><h3><strong>Too Hot, Too Cold, Just Right&#8212;They&#8217;re All Still Pretty Tight</strong></h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa100400-5b2c-4b0b-afdd-56786bbec95f_4749x2711.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa100400-5b2c-4b0b-afdd-56786bbec95f_4749x2711.png" width="1456" height="831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/aa100400-5b2c-4b0b-afdd-56786bbec95f_4749x2711.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:831,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1514417,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa100400-5b2c-4b0b-afdd-56786bbec95f_4749x2711.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa100400-5b2c-4b0b-afdd-56786bbec95f_4749x2711.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa100400-5b2c-4b0b-afdd-56786bbec95f_4749x2711.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa100400-5b2c-4b0b-afdd-56786bbec95f_4749x2711.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Let&#8217;s look at the three scenarios over a 10-year history. In the &#8220;average winter&#8221; scenario, temperatures follow their 10-year seasonal average and inventories fall to around 1.5 trillion cubic feet by the end of the winter drawdown in March. These levels are about 10% below the 5-year average, but still well within the 5-year range and in line with the 2014-15, 2017-18 and 2018-19 winter drawdowns. We&#8217;re in similarly normal inventory ranges in the &#8220;mild winter&#8221; scenario. This scenario puts us at the upper end of the 5-year inventory range, with a good number of historical parallels. Factoring for total system inventory cover (see my <a href="https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/gas-inventories-lower-than-they-appear">last natural gas post</a>), the typical-temperature winter scenario looks notably tighter at roughly 20% below the 5-year average compared to the mild scenario that essentially traces the 5-year average.</p><p>Then there is the truly threatening &#8220;cold winter&#8221; scenario, with the depth of its potential drawdown going a long way towards explaining higher gas prices. The &#8220;cold winter&#8221; scenario looks at what happens if we get a repeat of 2013-14 frigid cold temperatures, which at the January-February peak was about 15% colder than the 10-year average. This type of cold winter combined with current high exports and still-recovering production would pull nearly 3 trillion cubic feet of gas out of inventories through March and bring us to a perilously low inventory position of less than 700 Bcf. That inventory level amounts to just more than 6 days of total system demand cover when most winters fail to break below 20 days of inventory cover and only a couple drop below 15 days.</p><p>Now, the probability of slipping into the &#8220;cold scenario&#8221; is low; we&#8217;ve only had one winter with those extreme temperatures in the past decade. However, the massive potential implications for natural gas market balances help explain why we&#8217;re seeing such high prices today: even the low probability of a high impact scenario warrants material repricing, especially given the rest of the energy crises buzz that is electrifying markets at present.</p><h3><strong>You know what they say about assumptions&#8230;</strong></h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05e26b3f-8555-4cbf-947f-02d72ea82a30_4749x2711.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05e26b3f-8555-4cbf-947f-02d72ea82a30_4749x2711.png" width="1456" height="831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/05e26b3f-8555-4cbf-947f-02d72ea82a30_4749x2711.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:831,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1229371,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05e26b3f-8555-4cbf-947f-02d72ea82a30_4749x2711.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05e26b3f-8555-4cbf-947f-02d72ea82a30_4749x2711.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05e26b3f-8555-4cbf-947f-02d72ea82a30_4749x2711.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05e26b3f-8555-4cbf-947f-02d72ea82a30_4749x2711.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The purpose of this scenario-based piece was to give readers a sense of the magnitude of winter temperature variability on natural gas inventories.

This is certainly not the kind of production recovery we would have expected in pre-COVID times, but you can read more about why producers aren&#8217;t snapping back as quickly in my <a href="https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/hot-gas-summer">first natural gas post</a>.</p></li><li><p>I see LNG exports steadily rise to 12 billion cubic feet per day, reflecting a level previously achieved this past Spring. Flows will be further assisted by the start-up of new LNG export capacity through the first half of 2022, though no major uplift from these projects is assumed through May.</p></li><li><p>I keep pipeline exports to Mexico flatlined around current levels, while both exports to and imports from Canada reflect a typical seasonal patterns.</p></li><li><p>I also assumed Non-Residential, Non-Commercial domestic natural gas demand follow their &nbsp;typical seasonal pattern.</p></li></ol><p>Overall, these three scenarios assume that there is no movement in non-temperature variables, which is obviously unrealistic: if inventories fell as deeply as the cold winter scenario foresees, prices would surely rise enough to depress power or industrial demand or further accelerate production bounce back before the implications of the cold winter scenario are fully played out.</p><p><strong>We&#8217;re positioned for tight North American natural gas markets given higher export demands and continued pandemic production recovery, but ultimately the next six months of the natural gas market is largely up to the weather. The extent of the winter inventory drawdown varies by as much as 50% across three potential temperature-driven scenarios. Most notably, these scenarios highlight that the North American natural gas market faces a bullish near-term tilt as the combination of lower production and record exports are pressuring inventory cover lower.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Oil Strong but Headwinds Mounting]]></title><description><![CDATA[Crude market is tight and inventories falling but transitory COVID, sentiment headwinds building]]></description><link>https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/oil-strong-but-headwinds-building</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/oil-strong-but-headwinds-building</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Rory Johnston]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 18:21:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3980751-2e19-4a0b-8d51-43b234df5235_4749x2711.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3980751-2e19-4a0b-8d51-43b234df5235_4749x2711.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3980751-2e19-4a0b-8d51-43b234df5235_4749x2711.png" width="1456" height="831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a3980751-2e19-4a0b-8d51-43b234df5235_4749x2711.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:831,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1835391,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3980751-2e19-4a0b-8d51-43b234df5235_4749x2711.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3980751-2e19-4a0b-8d51-43b234df5235_4749x2711.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3980751-2e19-4a0b-8d51-43b234df5235_4749x2711.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3980751-2e19-4a0b-8d51-43b234df5235_4749x2711.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><ul><li><p><strong>Crude prices reached fresh pandemic-era highs of $85 per barrel (WTI); oil continues to see strong fundamental support, yet headwinds are building.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Oil market strength persists in the form of acute futures backwardation, continued drawdown of global inventories, recovering refinery margins, and a generally bullish environment towards all fuels amidst multi-headed global energy crises.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>But this rally is now obviously longer in the tooth than in August and near-term risks are building: the trajectory of COVID feels like it can only worsen through winter and we&#8217;re back into clearly stretched speculative sentiment territory.</strong></p></li></ul><p>Oil prices are really, really high again&#8212;you&#8217;ll hear a lot of &#8220;highest since 2014!&#8221; these days&#8212;and I thought this would be a good time to follow up on my last two higher-level oil market updates.</p><p><em>My first newsletter in late-June, <a href="https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/the-oil-market-is-super-tightbut">The Oil Market is Super Tight&#8212;But Also Not At All</a>, was balanced but broadly skeptical of the rally, highlighting that still-reasonable oil inventories, weak product markets, and excessive speculative positioning were all putting near-term risks to the downside.

I noted in my very first newsletter that calendar spreads&#8212;or the difference between various vintages of futures contracts&#8212;are a great directional indicator about the state of a commodity market like oil. As is the case now, spot prices that trade at a premium to future-dated barrels is known as &#8220;backwardation&#8221; and this is fundamentally bullish for markets as it reflects insufficient spot supply relative to current demand. Holders of inventory cease to be paid to store crude and are instead incentivized to release barrels to the market to fill the perceived production hole.</p><p>The acute backwardation facing crude markets today remains the strongest signal of insufficiency-supplied markets, and inventories continue to draw down rapidly around the world. In fact, OECD commercial crude inventories fell by a record 400+ million barrels since August 2020, more than erasing the pandemic-induced inventory glut. This drawdown rate is matched only by the scale of inventory <em>builds </em>during the cycle that tanked oil prices between 2014 and 2016.</p><p>But in such tight and precarious markets as we find ourselves today, I think it is also easy to overstate the fundamental value of rapid moves in calendar spreads, especially blowouts in intraday trading at the front of the curve. Recall that the reason timespreads are important is that they give us the <em>rough</em> direction and magnitude of inventory movements, but that sporadic moves throughout the day are more noise than signal. Even while writing this piece, the WTI prompt-spread (i.e., the difference between the front-month and the second-month futures contract) blew out from about $1.30 to $1.70 before collapsing back to around $1.15 in the span of just a few hours. That degree of volatility smells more like futures positioning and risk management activity than it does a true sign of a rapid change in the <em>magnitude</em> of the undersupply faced by the market, though the <em>direction </em>of spread movement remains constructive.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F369df273-c505-44a7-844e-1eb16367710c_4749x2711.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F369df273-c505-44a7-844e-1eb16367710c_4749x2711.png" width="1456" height="831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/369df273-c505-44a7-844e-1eb16367710c_4749x2711.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:831,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1366786,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F369df273-c505-44a7-844e-1eb16367710c_4749x2711.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F369df273-c505-44a7-844e-1eb16367710c_4749x2711.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F369df273-c505-44a7-844e-1eb16367710c_4749x2711.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F369df273-c505-44a7-844e-1eb16367710c_4749x2711.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>This sense of spot market tightness is exacerbated by the ongoing energy crises linked to tight natural gas, coal, and power markets across Europe and Asia. These multi-headed energy crises have the potential to contribute upwards of a million barrels per day of fuel switching demand, on top of the broadly bullish effect of the feeling of global scarcity on current sentiment. Demand has also continued to recover and, with the help of that aforementioned fuel switching, refining margins have roughly doubled from August levels, which further eases concerns about lingering weakness in end-product markets.</p><h3><strong>Crude vs COVID: Winter Wave Worries</strong></h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b0da501-48d7-4899-95d6-9ecd0a21fc5f_4749x2711.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b0da501-48d7-4899-95d6-9ecd0a21fc5f_4749x2711.png" width="1456" height="831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0b0da501-48d7-4899-95d6-9ecd0a21fc5f_4749x2711.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:831,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:947407,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b0da501-48d7-4899-95d6-9ecd0a21fc5f_4749x2711.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b0da501-48d7-4899-95d6-9ecd0a21fc5f_4749x2711.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b0da501-48d7-4899-95d6-9ecd0a21fc5f_4749x2711.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b0da501-48d7-4899-95d6-9ecd0a21fc5f_4749x2711.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Lower COVID case counts are obviously a great thing; however, at this stage it feels like developments over the winter can only get worse. As I first discussed in September, the year-to-date relationship between crude prices and global COVID case counts has more to do with investor sentiment than demand for oil products (although there is also a direct impact as outlined in my oil demand recovery piece <a href="https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/oils-uneven-demand-recovery">here</a>). As it currently concerns those interested in the constellation of factors driving the global oil market, COVID has shifted from a bullish to a neutral-to-potentially-bearish factor for crude.</p><p>See, the rally that took us to the highs of late-June was driven in part by rising risk appetite amidst falling global COVID cases. Then around the end of June, global COVID cases began to rise again, which coincided with a $13/bbl drop in the price of crude through mid-August. The high point of global cases marked the low point for crude prices in mid-August, after which both trends reversed with global case counts falling and crude rallying to set new pandemic-era highs above $85/bbl.</p><p>As for current global COVID case counts, we&#8217;re just coming off the bottom of another wave and it doesn&#8217;t feel possible to see much more improvement absent complete eradication (if wishing made it so&#8230;). We will likely see worsening global case counts next, an outlook made more probable as we head into winter and already see new infections gradually accelerating once again. The counter to this cautious COVID narrative is substantially higher vaccination rate: the number of global COVID vaccine doses administered has doubled since mid-July. Still, it remains to be seen if that higher vaccination rate will materially blunt the emergence of another winter wave and, with it, the market&#8217;s inevitable reaction.</p><h3><strong>Hot Money Rolling or Just Taking a Breather?</strong></h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3db9615-88ab-4fe8-9ecb-868bf8ef969e_4749x2711.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3db9615-88ab-4fe8-9ecb-868bf8ef969e_4749x2711.png" width="1456" height="831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b3db9615-88ab-4fe8-9ecb-868bf8ef969e_4749x2711.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:831,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1247457,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3db9615-88ab-4fe8-9ecb-868bf8ef969e_4749x2711.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3db9615-88ab-4fe8-9ecb-868bf8ef969e_4749x2711.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3db9615-88ab-4fe8-9ecb-868bf8ef969e_4749x2711.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3db9615-88ab-4fe8-9ecb-868bf8ef969e_4749x2711.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>As discussed above, the effect of macro and COVID concerns on crude prices has been primarily via speculative sentiment. The net position of speculators, as measured by Commitments of Traders reports, fell by roughly one-third through the July-August rout and coincided with a WTI price loss of about $13/bbl. As positions began to rise anew, oil price gains far outpaced their relative losses and rose almost twice as much as they had fallen despite only recovering about 60% of the liquidated length, indicating that the latest rally was driven by more than just hedge fund interest.</p><p>We still have room to go to hit the level of net length witnessed in late-June. This leaves fuel in the tank for further bursts higher; but it is also undeniable that we&#8217;ve re-entered a frothy sentiment environment in which the downside rationalization risk is ever present. In fact, it looks like net positions have already begun to roll over from the latest cycle high-water mark left at the beginning of October. The fact that crude prices haven&#8217;t collapsed outright is a positive sign of the market&#8217;s current resilience.</p><p><strong>Oil remains fundamentally well-supported as evidenced by tight calendar spreads and rapidly falling inventories. However, a constellation of shorter-term factors like the trajectory of the pandemic and speculative sentiment tip </strong><em><strong>near-term </strong></em><strong>risks to the downside. The ongoing energy crises around the world and the spectre of an especially frigid winter may be enough to support crude prices through what are expected to be temporary headwinds.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Natural Gas Inventories Lower than They Appear]]></title><description><![CDATA[North American natural gas inventories are very low when factoring for booming export demand and the global energy crisis]]></description><link>https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/gas-inventories-lower-than-they-appear</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/gas-inventories-lower-than-they-appear</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Rory Johnston]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 14:03:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84645621-eccc-47e6-b99c-a53583c8674a_4749x2711.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84645621-eccc-47e6-b99c-a53583c8674a_4749x2711.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84645621-eccc-47e6-b99c-a53583c8674a_4749x2711.png" width="1456" height="831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/84645621-eccc-47e6-b99c-a53583c8674a_4749x2711.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:831,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1361043,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84645621-eccc-47e6-b99c-a53583c8674a_4749x2711.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84645621-eccc-47e6-b99c-a53583c8674a_4749x2711.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84645621-eccc-47e6-b99c-a53583c8674a_4749x2711.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84645621-eccc-47e6-b99c-a53583c8674a_4749x2711.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><ul><li><p><strong>North American natural gas prices have surged to decade-highs, yet headline inventories appear reasonably full at face value.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>However, adjusted for steeply higher exports to global markets roiled by energy crises, inventories are actually at the bottom of their 5-year range, which better explains current market pricing.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Exports are likely to remain strong and Henry Hub price insensitive over the coming winter, which will create additional competition for scarce inventories even in an especially cold/tight market.</strong></p></li></ul><p>The price of Henry Hub natural gas, the primary North American benchmark, reached its highest level since 2008 at over $6 per Million Btu (MMBtu) earlier this month and, while easing back slightly, have remained heady at around $5/MMBtu.

Yet only some of that new supply was used by the US economy, while the lion&#8217;s share fed surging natural gas exports with cheap feedstock and facilitated the birth of the US LNG industry. (I first discussed these booming exports in my last natural gas <a href="https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/hot-gas-summer">piece</a>.) LNG exports have risen from nothing at the beginning of 2016 to more than 10 Bcfd today, while more traditional natural gas pipeline exports to Mexico have more than doubled to around 6.6 Bcfd. The turnaround in the US natural gas trade balance has been staggering: from net <em>imports</em> accounting for roughly 10% of available supply in 2011 to net <em>exports</em> exceeding 10% today.</p><p>This export demand is both less seasonal (relative to domestic demand) and operates on an entirely different economic calculus. For example, unlike in power generation where the relative cost of alternative fuels like coal will affect demand for natural gas, LNG exports are effectively a geographic arbitrage between domestic and foreign prices. This feature of LNG economics means that these exports act as a kind of natural pressure relief valve for the North American natural gas market. Price spikes put LNG exports out of the money and prompt shipments to fall, reducing demand and easing market strain. The extent and volume of that buffer is debatable: most of a facility&#8217;s capacity is theoretically locked up in long-term contracts; but, somewhere around one-quarter of LNG exports are more flexible spot cargoes. (Even then, LNG exports fell by more than half in Summer 2020, so we certainly have some demonstrated flex.)</p><p>However, the global energy crisis has clogged this pressure value with $30+/MMBtu LNG prices in Europe and Asia. This extremely high global gas price environment means that Henry Hub prices could rise 5-fold before compromising LNG economics, so all bets are off if winter is cold and inventories get tight. If you assume that those exports aren&#8217;t budging even if prices rise, it&#8217;s useful to adjust inventory sufficiency calculations to understand the true extent of our winter stores. And that&#8217;s where we start to run into problems, with that adjusted inventory figure sitting at the very bottom of its 5-year average heading into this winter.</p><h3><strong>Effective Inventories Deflated by Export Demand</strong></h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c3bb1ea-80ca-4737-b87f-621c5fd20ff0_4749x2711.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c3bb1ea-80ca-4737-b87f-621c5fd20ff0_4749x2711.png" width="1456" height="831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1c3bb1ea-80ca-4737-b87f-621c5fd20ff0_4749x2711.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:831,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1034021,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c3bb1ea-80ca-4737-b87f-621c5fd20ff0_4749x2711.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c3bb1ea-80ca-4737-b87f-621c5fd20ff0_4749x2711.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c3bb1ea-80ca-4737-b87f-621c5fd20ff0_4749x2711.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c3bb1ea-80ca-4737-b87f-621c5fd20ff0_4749x2711.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Adjusting for both higher domestic demand and steeply higher exports, we are currently at the bottom of the 5-year range for this time of year (right chart vs demand-only chart on left). Looking back over the longer history of this series (first chart at top), you can see that there was a wide deviation of this series below its 5-year average in 2018. While this deviation did prompt a price rally, it is important to note that the differential between domestic and foreign gas prices wasn&#8217;t high enough for the market to view a complete blowout as a possibility. And that&#8217;s where things start looking starkly different today.</p><p>With that wider Henry Hub-Global LNG pricing spread, it&#8217;s possible that adjusted inventories are even lower than they appear on the above chart.

In fact, even before adjusting for demand, let alone exports, inventory volumes are below their 5-year range. Save the short-lived spike during the 2014 polar vortex, North American benchmark Mont Belvieu propane prices have risen to their highest level since 2011. Like natural gas, exports have been rising on the back of growth in US shale gas production, but are an even larger share at more than half of total available supply.</p><p><strong>Heating fuels like natural gas and propane are heading into winter with weak inventory positions as well as large and price-insensitive export demand. The pace of recent export growth necessitates adjusting nominal inventory levels for this rising demand sink, which facilitates a better understanding of price moves despite </strong><em><strong>apparent </strong></em><strong>headline inventory sufficiency. While propane inventories are already in critical territory, natural gas inventories may prove enough absent an especially cold winter (a subject for another newsletter). Still, the low inventory position mixed with the unknowability about ultimate winter conditions pushes the market to price in winter tail risk.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fly, You Fools: Oilâ€™s Uneven Demand Recovery]]></title><description><![CDATA[Jet Fuel Demand Still Has Furthest to Climb, Gasoline Likely Already Exceeding Pre-Pandemic Levels]]></description><link>https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/oils-uneven-demand-recovery</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/oils-uneven-demand-recovery</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Rory Johnston]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 15:00:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F526567be-6457-4e54-b394-fdeee2080584_4749x2711.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F526567be-6457-4e54-b394-fdeee2080584_4749x2711.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F526567be-6457-4e54-b394-fdeee2080584_4749x2711.png" width="1456" height="831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/526567be-6457-4e54-b394-fdeee2080584_4749x2711.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:831,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1406112,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F526567be-6457-4e54-b394-fdeee2080584_4749x2711.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F526567be-6457-4e54-b394-fdeee2080584_4749x2711.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F526567be-6457-4e54-b394-fdeee2080584_4749x2711.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F526567be-6457-4e54-b394-fdeee2080584_4749x2711.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><ul><li><p><strong>Unlike other commodities (e.g., lumber, steel) that received a surprising pandemic consumption boost, global oil demand remains depressed below pre-COVID levels.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Of the two major road fuels, gasoline consumption has seen a full recovery and has likely already surpassed pre-pandemic volumes, while distillate demand has remained relatively steady over the course of the pandemic.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>It&#8217;s unsurprisingly jet fuel demand that continues to lag well below the pre-pandemic norm and accounts for the bulk of remaining COVID demand damage, with ongoing volatility in air travel trends.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Jet fuel will be the most important demand recovery category over the coming year, with the potential to contribute upwards of 4 MMbpd overall oil demand lift from June levels if pre-pandemic growth rates can be restored.</strong></p></li></ul><p>While many commodities&#8212;lumber, <a href="https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/steel-smelt-up">steel</a>, <a href="https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/dr-copper-still-studying-in-china">copper</a>, etc.&#8212;have experienced a surprising boost to demand as locked-down economies shifted spending away from services toward durable goods, oil continues to struggle with weak demand given still-depressed global mobility, particularly in air travel.

While gasoline consumption yo-yo&#8217;ed through the pandemic, demand for good ol&#8217; diesel remained fairly steady. The impacts of the economic downturn were largely offset by the surge in shipping and logistical services: people didn&#8217;t buy less, they just had it all delivered directly to their home.</p><p>Over the past month or so, diesel demand has experienced a boost on the back of gas-to-oil fuel switching amidst the acute energy crisis in Europe and Asia. Since natural gas prices in crises-stricken regions are well above $200/bbl in oil-equivalent terms, facilities that have feedstock flexibility have been switching from natural gas to diesel or fuel oil (more on the pricing impact at the end). Industry sources put the possible fuel-switching volume in the ballpark of 500 thousand barrels per day, which is certainly material but far smaller than the potential contribution that would come from a recovery in air travel.</p><h3><strong>Jet Fuel: Pulled Out of a Nosedive but Trouble Gaining Altitude</strong></h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33f68cd9-c286-43f9-8ea6-b8a7997579a2_4749x2711.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33f68cd9-c286-43f9-8ea6-b8a7997579a2_4749x2711.png" width="1456" height="831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/33f68cd9-c286-43f9-8ea6-b8a7997579a2_4749x2711.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:831,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1059532,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33f68cd9-c286-43f9-8ea6-b8a7997579a2_4749x2711.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33f68cd9-c286-43f9-8ea6-b8a7997579a2_4749x2711.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33f68cd9-c286-43f9-8ea6-b8a7997579a2_4749x2711.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33f68cd9-c286-43f9-8ea6-b8a7997579a2_4749x2711.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Jet fuel&#8212;end use of which is pretty self-explanatory&#8212;was the fuel most battered by the COVID border lockdowns and international travel restrictions. Consumption of jet fuel fell by nearly 75% in the early months of the pandemic and the demand damage has been longer lasting, still down at least 1/3 as of June 2021 compared to where we&#8217;d expect it for this time of year.</p><p>There is little doubt that jet fuel is the final battlefield of the oil demand COVID recovery, with still-depressed business travel and wary international vacationers at the forefront. When considering how much further jet fuel demand can climb, it&#8217;s important to remember that jet fuel demand growth was much stronger than that of gasoline or diesel pre-pandemic. If jet fuel can regain that pre-COVID trend growth rate&#8212;i.e., there is no permanent post-COVID behaviour change&#8212;then jet fuel demand in this sample could rise by roughly 60% or almost 2 MMbpd (implying upwards of 4 MMbpd globally) from June 2021 levels.</p><p>Current air traffic activity indicators remain mixed, however, with strong growth in the US, Canada, and Japan and weakening conditions in China and India. A global deceleration of COVID case counts will provide tailwinds to jet fuel demand into the end of the year, but the risk of reacceleration and continued mix of country-level recoveries&#8212;not to mention any potential for longer lasting behaviour change&#8212;push any likely global recovery to pre-COVID levels into mid-2022.</p><p><strong>Global petroleum product consumption has nearly recovered to pre-pandemic levels, but unsurprisingly jet fuel remains the largest hole in demand. Gas-to-oil switching may provide some near-term support but ultimately presents only a fraction of the potential demand still waiting to recover in air travel. Unfortunately, while the recovery in jet fuel demand is trending positive, air travel activity is increasingly volatile across the globe, which will make this last leg of the COVID recovery particularly bumpy.</strong></p><h4><strong>PS: a quick note on gas-to-oil fuel switching and crack spreads</strong></h4><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffff10113-44c9-4750-be86-f8bfce9b6dac_4749x2711.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffff10113-44c9-4750-be86-f8bfce9b6dac_4749x2711.png" width="1456" height="831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fff10113-44c9-4750-be86-f8bfce9b6dac_4749x2711.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:831,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1364509,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffff10113-44c9-4750-be86-f8bfce9b6dac_4749x2711.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffff10113-44c9-4750-be86-f8bfce9b6dac_4749x2711.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffff10113-44c9-4750-be86-f8bfce9b6dac_4749x2711.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffff10113-44c9-4750-be86-f8bfce9b6dac_4749x2711.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The past month has seen a fairly stark reversal of fortune in crack spreads. Gasoline had spent most of the pandemic as the strongest part of the barrel but is now easing back, while diesel and jet fuel have rallied. General jet fuel strength does likely reflect some true air travel recovery, but the recent rally is too steep and correlated with diesel, particularly in Europe and Singapore, to be unrelated; likely that both diesel and jet fuel are being driven higher by oil-to-gas switching (as discussed in the distillate section above) rather than any durable improvement in core end markets. It is also important to note that despite these higher crack spreads, true refinery margins in Europe and Asia are also facing acutely inflated costs of everything from natural gas to electricity to emissions, which likely offsets at least some of the product price gains.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Great Steel Smelt Up]]></title><description><![CDATA[Steel price explosion began in China but US market remains tightest]]></description><link>https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/steel-smelt-up</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/steel-smelt-up</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Rory Johnston]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 13:32:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9c345e7-dba9-4d8c-aff1-b29dd4b9401d_4749x2711.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9c345e7-dba9-4d8c-aff1-b29dd4b9401d_4749x2711.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9c345e7-dba9-4d8c-aff1-b29dd4b9401d_4749x2711.png" width="1456" height="831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e9c345e7-dba9-4d8c-aff1-b29dd4b9401d_4749x2711.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:831,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1101528,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9c345e7-dba9-4d8c-aff1-b29dd4b9401d_4749x2711.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9c345e7-dba9-4d8c-aff1-b29dd4b9401d_4749x2711.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9c345e7-dba9-4d8c-aff1-b29dd4b9401d_4749x2711.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9c345e7-dba9-4d8c-aff1-b29dd4b9401d_4749x2711.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><ul><li><p><strong>Steel prices rallied around the world but have gone higher and for longer in the US.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The rally began in China with strong real estate investment and manufacturing activity, pushing Chinese steel production higher and pulling up the price of feedstocks like iron ore.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>What began as a cost-related price increase in China quickly turned into a global supply chain crunch and rush for metal in the US and Europe, where prices rose to all-time highs in 2021.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>US steel prices continue to mint fresh all-time highs while inventories are only starting to rise from all-time lows.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>While the bulk of the price spike is likely behind us, steel prices should not collapse in the way we&#8217;ve seen across lumber or iron ore markets.

A quintessentially ubiquitous commodity, the steel industry had previously suffered from years of excess global capacity, lacklustre demand, and falling prices. Then COVID changed everything. Like the wild lumber spike earlier this year, the exploding prices of and lead-times for everything steel&#8212;from wall panels to rebar&#8212;have pushed up costs and compounded bottlenecks further downstream.</p><p>So, what&#8217;s going on with the steel market and why are steel consumers in the US facing an especially tight situation?</p><p>Off the bat, it&#8217;s important to recognize that steel markets are highly regional. Steel is heavy and expensive to transport, which creates natural trade frictions that favour local producers (at least to a point). This is particularly exaggerated right now as shipping costs experience their own bullwhip crack to all-time highs. Also, steel industries tend to be political: steel production typically employs politically valuable, often unionized, constituencies concentrated in key electoral jurisdictions, which frequently leads to protectionist policies like of tariffs and other trade barriers. Global steel prices tend to move broadly together but given these interregional frictions can deviate significantly between China, the US, and Europe, particularly in the short term&#8212;these days, they are deviating by <em><strong>A LOT</strong></em>.</p><h3><strong>All Metallic Roads Begin in China</strong></h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feac2c9e6-2346-45ca-a401-1b755701c0c1_4749x2711.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feac2c9e6-2346-45ca-a401-1b755701c0c1_4749x2711.png" width="1456" height="831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/eac2c9e6-2346-45ca-a401-1b755701c0c1_4749x2711.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:831,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:918371,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feac2c9e6-2346-45ca-a401-1b755701c0c1_4749x2711.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feac2c9e6-2346-45ca-a401-1b755701c0c1_4749x2711.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feac2c9e6-2346-45ca-a401-1b755701c0c1_4749x2711.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feac2c9e6-2346-45ca-a401-1b755701c0c1_4749x2711.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>As with other industrial metals, China <em>dominates </em>the global steel industry, producing and consuming about half the world&#8217;s total tonnage (see my discussion about <a href="https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/dr-copper-still-studying-in-china">Chinese copper demand</a>).

Iron ore miners were, as everyone else, expecting a pandemic demand recession and had suffered COVID-related shutdowns at mines and through the shipping industry. With the run up of surprisingly strong demand from China against this weakened global supply, seaborne iron ore prices boomed to all-time highs by Spring 2021.</p><p>Steel and iron headed higher together until they both peaked in May 2021. From there, Chinese steel prices fell back slightly and ultimately plateaued at still-high levels around $900 per tonne, supported by government mandated production cuts. While less steel production is good for domestic Chinese steel prices, it&#8217;s been terrible for iron ore prices, which have continued to collapse.</p><p>China now faces two opposing trends that will determine the course of steel prices over the next year. The steel-positive trend is the aforementioned production pullback: Beijing doesn&#8217;t want 2021 steel production to exceed 2020 levels, partly in pursuit of its decarbonization goals as well as a strategy aimed at reducing raw material prices, where they continue to have an acute effect on iron ore. The steel-negative trend is construction-related demand: real estate activity indicators are already diving and the ever-worsening condition of property behemoth Evergrande (<em>way</em> too big a story to get into now) presents a significant tail-risk of steeper demand losses.</p><h3>The US Steel Rally Never Ended</h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcbbaac8d-3740-4709-8dd4-e0e0f2d8bdb4_4749x2711.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcbbaac8d-3740-4709-8dd4-e0e0f2d8bdb4_4749x2711.png" width="1456" height="831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cbbaac8d-3740-4709-8dd4-e0e0f2d8bdb4_4749x2711.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:831,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:924576,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcbbaac8d-3740-4709-8dd4-e0e0f2d8bdb4_4749x2711.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcbbaac8d-3740-4709-8dd4-e0e0f2d8bdb4_4749x2711.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcbbaac8d-3740-4709-8dd4-e0e0f2d8bdb4_4749x2711.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcbbaac8d-3740-4709-8dd4-e0e0f2d8bdb4_4749x2711.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>While the rally rolled over months ago in China and weeks ago in Europe, US steel prices keep heading higher&#8212;currently at around $2000 per short ton or almost double the previous high set back in 2008.</p><p>US apparent steel demand began outstripping supply in June 2020; but unlike in China, domestic US mills were relatively slow to react. In fact, US steel production has yet to outpace pre-COVID levels while demand is as strong as it&#8217;s been in years. Even since the pandemic began, the US steel industry has consolidated and production capacity has fallen to the point that production capacity utilization&#8212;a standard way of measuring how hard the industry is running&#8212;is running above 85%, its highest level since 2008 despite the still-depressed production volume. The US steel sector doesn&#8217;t typically stray far above that 85% mark; we haven&#8217;t seen 90% utilization since before the Great Financial Crisis.</p><p>If we&#8217;re ever going to see mills push their limits to maximize output, however, now is the time&#8212;with prices at all-time highs and the Trump-era steel tariffs remaining in place. Still, it will take time to refill severely depleted inventories even if producers can rise to meet demand. Imports could rise, but probably not until shipping bottlenecks and/or tariffs are unwound. In the interim, Canada has come out as an obvious winner with steel exports to the US rising to levels, which, if maintained, would also be the strongest since 2008.</p><p>There is always the possibility of a demand-side correction: another COVID wave, a wearing-off of the general post-pandemic sugar high, or a reopening that shifts spending from goods toward services to cool manufacturing demand. But it&#8217;s more likely that the bullwhip will have more than one crack. As some bottlenecks ease&#8212;in semiconductors and auto manufacturing, for instance&#8212;demand in currently depressed but typically important steel demand drivers will snap back, adding subsequent waves to the materials demand pull.</p><p><strong>Absent a severe unwinding of China&#8217;s real estate sector (always a good caveat), Chinese steel prices will continue to trade sideways and exert gradual downward pressure on prices elsewhere. While US steel prices may continue rising for a short time longer, it is likely that the bulk of the price spike is behind us as inventories begin to slowly rise again. However, it also seems doubtful that prices will collapse as quickly as we saw in lumber or iron ore markets, which fell almost as quickly as they rose. Record-low inventories still need to be rebuilt and demand is likely to remain relatively robust&#8212;even if we begin to see weakness in currently-strong sectors, we will see additional bursts of demand from sectors like the auto industry as the debottleneck.</strong></p><p></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Crude healthier today than when prices were higher]]></title><description><![CDATA[Less dependence on hot money and more spec headroom for next move up]]></description><link>https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/crude-healthier-today-than-highs</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/crude-healthier-today-than-highs</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Rory Johnston]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 15:43:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff78d7104-cd4a-44ec-a9e6-86bf8434ee81_4749x2711.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff78d7104-cd4a-44ec-a9e6-86bf8434ee81_4749x2711.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff78d7104-cd4a-44ec-a9e6-86bf8434ee81_4749x2711.png" width="1456" height="831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f78d7104-cd4a-44ec-a9e6-86bf8434ee81_4749x2711.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:831,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1533042,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff78d7104-cd4a-44ec-a9e6-86bf8434ee81_4749x2711.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff78d7104-cd4a-44ec-a9e6-86bf8434ee81_4749x2711.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff78d7104-cd4a-44ec-a9e6-86bf8434ee81_4749x2711.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff78d7104-cd4a-44ec-a9e6-86bf8434ee81_4749x2711.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><ul><li><p><strong>It&#8217;s been a bumpy two months for crude prices, which fell by one-fifth from pandemic-era highs only to quickly retrace more than half those losses. </strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The initial rout was driven by the reacceleration of global COVID case counts, accentuated by the liquidation of speculative long positions.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>While fundamentals have shifted with the virus, myopic investor sentiment moved further, faster&#8212;both on the way up and on the choppy ride back down.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The past two months of oil price backsliding was both rational (prices had gotten ahead of themselves) and healthy (frees up positioning headroom for the next move higher)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Oil prices look healthier today&#8212;slightly lower but with much more potential upside&#8212;than when they were precariously sitting at pandemic-era highs merely two months ago.</strong></p></li></ul><p>Oil prices have been on quite the roller coaster over the past two months, plunging from a pandemic-era high of $75.25 per barrel (bbl) in early-July to $62.32/bbl in mid-August back to around $69/bbl today. </p><p>My first newsletter on crude&#8217;s precarious rally in late-June&#8212;the publication of which coincided with the high-water mark for crude prices in 2021&#8212;highlighted some of the fundamental weaknesses that I thought were being obscured by oil&#8217;s steep price gains.

This fallback was the latest iteration of a cycle that has played out repeatedly over the past year: crude prices have been grinding structurally higher from depressed 2020 levels, with that steady rally getting supercharged in periods when global COVID cases are falling (January-February, May-June) and temporarily derailed&#8212;backslide followed by range-bound trading&#8212;when those cases begin to rise anew (March-April, July-August). </p><p>While this latest wave obviously slowed the oil demand recovery slightly&#8212;the latest IEA OMR notes that that global oil demand fell back slightly (0.12 MMbpd) in July, but only after surging 3.8 MMbpd in June&#8212;investor myopia can be largely credited with aggressive price swings, both on the upside and on the way back down. When COVID case counts were bottoming, investors became overzealous and overbid crude on its central reopening narrative, pushing it higher than it deserved given lingering headwinds and the high likelihood of at least one more COVID wave. When COVID cases reaccelerate, that hot money floods out.</p><p>The current COVID new case plateau combined with rising vaccination rates means that we&#8217;re already likely past the point of peak COVID-sentiment weight on oil prices and that these headwinds will become tailwinds if new case identification continues to reverse.</p><p><strong>Hot Money, Cold Feet</strong></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d586ea1-e144-4a51-94d2-6f7ba63432c4_4749x2711.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d586ea1-e144-4a51-94d2-6f7ba63432c4_4749x2711.png" width="1456" height="831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2d586ea1-e144-4a51-94d2-6f7ba63432c4_4749x2711.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:831,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1253571,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d586ea1-e144-4a51-94d2-6f7ba63432c4_4749x2711.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d586ea1-e144-4a51-94d2-6f7ba63432c4_4749x2711.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d586ea1-e144-4a51-94d2-6f7ba63432c4_4749x2711.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d586ea1-e144-4a51-94d2-6f7ba63432c4_4749x2711.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Speculative sentiment toward crude oil&#8212;as measured by managed money positions in futures contracts&#8212;has eased off substantially since June. Net-long positions have fallen by more than a quarter, the equivalent of about 200 million paper barrels of crude, and the move was mostly driven by the liquidation of long positions than the establishment of fresh shorts. Funds likely saw great returns on those profit-taking decisions, with oil prices nearly doubling between late-2020 when said positions began to accumulate and when they started selling in early-July 2021. </p><p>Net speculative positioning in combined Brent and WTI contracts is back to around the levels last seen in August 2020, when crude was trading more than $25 cheaper in the low-$40s per barrel and futures contracts were still trading in contango territory.

Production, meanwhile, is much steadier throughout the year. Balancing the seasonal mismatch falls to inventory management: stocks are typically built up between April and November and then draw down from November to April.</p><p>Inventories started 2021 near the upper end of their 5-year range but fell precipitously to below 5-year average levels in February as a result of the winter storms that roiled much of the US and were especially acute in Texas. Not only did heating demand skyrocket, but temperatures dropped so low that gas producers experienced so-called &#8220;freeze-offs&#8221; that cratered natural gas production just when it was most needed. In little more than a week, the winter storm blew through what had been a healthy volume of buffer stocks and primed the market for prices to rise to the levels we&#8217;re seeing today. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cold winter, hot summer kept demand strong and inventory injections weak</strong></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a8a764c-27d4-40fd-a935-7f0ae324f212_4749x2711.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a8a764c-27d4-40fd-a935-7f0ae324f212_4749x2711.png" width="1456" height="831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4a8a764c-27d4-40fd-a935-7f0ae324f212_4749x2711.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:831,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1352083,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a8a764c-27d4-40fd-a935-7f0ae324f212_4749x2711.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a8a764c-27d4-40fd-a935-7f0ae324f212_4749x2711.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a8a764c-27d4-40fd-a935-7f0ae324f212_4749x2711.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a8a764c-27d4-40fd-a935-7f0ae324f212_4749x2711.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The winter freeze (blue circles on the chart above) was followed by a blisteringly hot summer that kept demand from the power generation sector well above typical levels as North Americans ramped up air conditioner use (red circles).

In normal times, the economics of exports (especially pricier-to-process LNG) would strain under rising feedstock prices linked to Henry Hub and then facilitate some degree of natural pressure release for the market. However, as discussed at the outset, this gas boom has been global in scope and prices would need to rise much, much higher to make a dent in potential liquefaction margins amidst LNG prices in the $15 per MMBtu ballpark through much of the world. China, Brazil, India, and South Korea have all recently imported record volumes of LNG. Furthermore, there really isn&#8217;t any slack in the global gas production system, save Russia, which seems unlikely to lift gas exports to Europe before the approval of the geopolitically contentious Nord Stream 2 pipeline.</p><p><strong>US supply response restrained by newfound producer discipline</strong></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F156e0dbc-eb6c-4379-8fb0-703d46f3b124_4749x2711.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F156e0dbc-eb6c-4379-8fb0-703d46f3b124_4749x2711.png" width="1456" height="831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/156e0dbc-eb6c-4379-8fb0-703d46f3b124_4749x2711.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:831,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:606829,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F156e0dbc-eb6c-4379-8fb0-703d46f3b124_4749x2711.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F156e0dbc-eb6c-4379-8fb0-703d46f3b124_4749x2711.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F156e0dbc-eb6c-4379-8fb0-703d46f3b124_4749x2711.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F156e0dbc-eb6c-4379-8fb0-703d46f3b124_4749x2711.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>This combination of robust domestic demand and surging exports wouldn&#8217;t have been such a challenge in the past. In fact, the North American natural gas market has felt the pressure of unrelenting and seemingly endless production for much of the past decade with prices far lower than they are today. The two greatest sources of that production growth have been the prolific shale gas basins&#8212;especially the mammoth Marcellus Shale in the northeastern US&#8212;and gas produced as a by-product of tight oil production&#8212;particularly in the Permian Basin across west Texas and eastern New Mexico.</p><p>Fast forward to today, however, and the situation has changed. As discussed in my <a href="https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/the-oil-market-is-super-tightbut">first newsletter</a> on the crude market, US producers have yielded to equity market pressure to resist growth-focused investments and prioritize cashflow. Combined with COVID-walloped prices in 2020 and the resultant uncertainty, US natural gas production fell back and isn&#8217;t expected to exceed pre-COVID levels despite currently lofty prices until the fourth quarter of 2022 at the earliest according to the latest forecasts from the US Energy Information Administration.</p><p><strong>In short, natural gas prices are high today because demand remains robust, weather has been unforgiving, and producers don&#8217;t seem that interested in drilling more any time soon despite attractive margins. The saving grace for natural gas consumers is that inventories remain at a reasonably safe level for this time of year. But that inventory safety could be jeopardized if exports keep rising or we have an especially cold winter the market, which would push markets into a more precarious position in a few months&#8217; time. </strong></p><p><strong>Think of today&#8217;s high price as a test by the market: will producers take the bait and drill again despite their recent restraint commitment? Will exporters let up? Will we catch a break in the form of a mild winter? Let&#8217;s check back in a few months.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dr. Copper still studying in China]]></title><description><![CDATA[Booming Chinese imports saved copper in 2020 but favourable demand trends will likely ease over coming months]]></description><link>https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/dr-copper-still-studying-in-china</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/dr-copper-still-studying-in-china</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Rory Johnston]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 14:33:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd536c3f7-99d6-4b63-8252-ed5443c9884a_4749x2711.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd536c3f7-99d6-4b63-8252-ed5443c9884a_4749x2711.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd536c3f7-99d6-4b63-8252-ed5443c9884a_4749x2711.png" width="1456" height="831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d536c3f7-99d6-4b63-8252-ed5443c9884a_4749x2711.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:831,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1137141,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd536c3f7-99d6-4b63-8252-ed5443c9884a_4749x2711.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd536c3f7-99d6-4b63-8252-ed5443c9884a_4749x2711.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd536c3f7-99d6-4b63-8252-ed5443c9884a_4749x2711.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd536c3f7-99d6-4b63-8252-ed5443c9884a_4749x2711.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><ul><li><p>Copper prices are really high and they&#8217;re moving higher yet again but the foundation of the rally above $4 per pound was built on a Chinese copper import boom in 2020.</p></li><li><p>Those imports began as opportunistic bargain shopping for strategic inventories but became a mad dash for metal to satisfying ravenous demand for Chinese exports and physical goods more broadly benefiting from the pandemic-shuttered service industry.</p></li><li><p>Absent a stark change in Beijing&#8217;s policy priorities, many of the favourable demand trends that have benefitted copper prices look set to normalize and exert downside pressure on contracts over the coming months, though longer-term energy-transition investment demand expectations remain strong even if timing remains an open question.</p></li></ul><p>Copper prices are really, really high and US futures contracts are sitting around $4.50 per pound.

And this influence has only grown more acute since the onset of the pandemic as China&#8217;s apparent demand ripped higher in stark contrast to waning consumption through the rest of the world. </p><p>In a global copper market of about 25 million tonnes annually, the International Copper Study Group (ICSG) estimates that 2020 saw a deficit of roughly 600 thousand tonnes (2.4%)&#8212;a very tight market, thanks entirely to a massive Chinese import boom. The ICSG now expects the copper market to record small surpluses in 2021-22, but forecasting is challenging in the best of times and mid-pandemic forecasts come with especially wide error bands. Last year&#8217;s China-driven deficit was hardly a foregone conclusion ahead of time. </p><p>Indicators of Chinese copper market tightness like local premia and refining margins were validating dour demand forecasts earlier this year. In April, the physical premium for Chinese copper cratered into negative territory for the first time since 2019 and refinery treatment charges for imported copper ore fell to their lowest level in more than a decade, a sign of relatively flush mined ore supplies. But both those indicators have begun to quickly rise again over the past couple months, signalling that China&#8217;s appetite for the red metal isn&#8217;t satiated quite yet.</p><p>Where does China&#8217;s copper demand go from here?

As can be seen in the chart above, China&#8217;s apparent demand for copper boomed before its three more-visible copper-intensive industries even got off the starting line, meaning the consumption jolt likely began as an opportunistic accumulation of strategic stockpiles at a time of pandemic-depressed pricing. </p><p>Then something funny happened. Government stimulus floated household purchasing power around the world and pent-up spending that would have gone to movie theatres, hair salons, bars, and vacations all got plowed into home renovations and physical consumer goods. Suddenly, the world really needed Chinese goods exports&#8212;and lots of them, which means plenty of new copper demand. China&#8217;s real estate market has begun adding further demand pressure on the back of rising sales and copper-intensive completions, which typically spur more copper intensive appliance purchases. </p><p>Demand was running so hot and prices rising so quickly that Beijing shifted its attention to what it increasingly saw as destabilizing commodity inflation. The Chinese government clamped down on financial speculation and Beijing&#8217;s strategic inventory managers came full circle by returning some of the accumulated stocks back to the market to cool prices.</p><p>Going forward, most of the trends that have supported copper&#8217;s wild rally look unsustainable. Strategic inventories are already being unwound. Chinese export demand will likely suffer as consumers shift back to spending on services in a reopening economy at the expense of copper-intensive goods.

This agreement will see members increase their collective production target at a steady, stepwise pace of 400 thousand barrels per day (kbpd) each month from August 2021 through Fall 2022, at which point the full 9.7 MMbpd of original cuts will have fallen off entirely. The baseline bruhaha, which caused the initial stand-off and subsequent negotiation postponement, won&#8217;t become relevant until May 2022&#8212;if at all&#8212;and those adjustments are discussed in all their fuzzy glory more fully below.</p><p>The OPEC+ compromise and steady easing pace is good news for the oil market, as I stated in my <a href="https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/opec-controls-the-oil-market-for">last newsletter</a>. The oil market desperately needs additional barrels to ease current <a href="https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/the-oil-market-is-super-tightbut">artificial tightness</a>. Indeed, the market likely could have absorbed 1-2 MMbpd more crude by year-end than was secured in this deal, with balances in the second half of 2021 (2H21) likely remaining in a deficit of millions of barrels per day. Therefore, even with this boosted OPEC+ production path, tight spot market conditions will likely contribute to further upward price pressure over the coming months.</p><p>But then OPEC&#8217;s own forecasts begin to paint a weaker demand picture in the first half of 2022, which when combined with still-rising OPEC+ output flips the market into surplus for the first time since the initial May 2020 cut to offset the pandemic demand rout. Given the amount of speculative money still supporting the price of crude, even a temporary return to oversupply, contango, and rising inventories could prompt a harsh&#8212;though transient&#8212;rout.</p><p>Things start to look more durably bullish going into the second half of 2022 when OPEC+ cuts have rolled off and the market is facing tighter conditions with what are by then low global crude inventories and slim OPEC spare capacity. The handoff into 2023 is setting up to be especially tight absent renewed growth from non-OPEC+ producers (e.g. the newly growth averse US shale patch) or a moderation of post-pandemic demand gains.</p><p><strong>Tranquility Baseline. The Eagle has landed&#8212;kinda </strong></p><p>While the agreement was explicit about the easing pace and extension timeline, the more controversial baseline adjustments were left diplomatically fuzzy and ultimately lack any immediate market impact. </p><p>The UAE got some of what it was after: its baseline will be increased by roughly 350 kbpd to 3.5 MMbpd, which is better than the initial October 2018 baseline but only half-way to the 3.84 MMbpd produced in April 2020. Good luck changing only one country&#8217;s baseline, though. Four other members used this opportunity to extract their own concessions: Saudi Arabia and Russia each added 500 kbpd to their baselines, and Iraq and Kuwait each got a boost of 150 kbpd. In total, the group&#8217;s collective baseline will rise by more than 1.6 MMbpd on May 1st, 2022.</p><p>Ultimately, this baseline hike is likely more for show than any real trigger for growth. Roughly two-thirds of the overall baseline increase went to Saudi Arabia&#8212;which has typically over-complied with cut requirements&#8212;and Russia&#8212;which despite steady quota cheating faces a host of operational challenges to ever reaching this higher production quota. Even for the lucky members that received baseline upgrades and would produce more if they could, the general understanding of the deal is that the 400 kbpd easing pace would be unaffected by these baseline revisions. The main benefit these five baseline-revised members will receive is a greater proportional share of the 400 kbpd easing pace from May 1, 2022 forward. </p><p>Even the endpoint of the cuts will remain unchanged: a further 5.8 MMbpd of easing from July allowances and a total rollback of the 9.7 MMbpd of cuts from October 2018 levels. The implicit spare capacity that remains in countries like the UAE seems to have been left as a topic for another day. All in all, the baseline discussion consumed way, way more oxygen (and my attention) than it deserved and appear to be a true more-heat-than-light kerfuffle in classic OPEC tradition.</p><p><strong>In the end, OPEC+&#8217;s production deal came in broadly as expected and when contextualized with OPEC&#8217;s latest 2021-22 forecasts yields a steadily tighter oil market only temporarily derailed by a seasonal demand slump in the first half of 2022 before tightening again as we head into 2023.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[OPEC+ Controls the Oil Market for Better or Worse]]></title><description><![CDATA[OPEC and its allies saved the oil market but continued salvation is far from assured.]]></description><link>https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/opec-controls-the-oil-market-for</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/opec-controls-the-oil-market-for</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Rory Johnston]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 15:00:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ebd921b-9d92-43d3-99a6-4412dd55498a_4749x2711.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ebd921b-9d92-43d3-99a6-4412dd55498a_4749x2711.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ebd921b-9d92-43d3-99a6-4412dd55498a_4749x2711.png" width="1456" height="831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1ebd921b-9d92-43d3-99a6-4412dd55498a_4749x2711.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:831,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:804669,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ebd921b-9d92-43d3-99a6-4412dd55498a_4749x2711.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ebd921b-9d92-43d3-99a6-4412dd55498a_4749x2711.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ebd921b-9d92-43d3-99a6-4412dd55498a_4749x2711.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ebd921b-9d92-43d3-99a6-4412dd55498a_4749x2711.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><ul><li><p><strong>OPEC+ saved the market by cutting production in April 2020 and has since been gradually easing those cuts; a broadly, but not unanimously, accepted plan would have seen the group further ease these cuts through end-2021 and extend the deal through end-2022.</strong></p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>The UAE unexpectedly opposed the extension of the deal, demanding a higher baseline against which the cuts should be calculated.

Even if said salvation came only after a market share conflagration that contributed to WTI oil prices trading negative for the first time in history, the emergency supply management surely spared the market from months of destabilizingly low prices that would have done lasting damage to the industry&#8217;s productive capacity. </p><p>Now OPEC+ is in near-total control of oil prices, with the producer group arguably holding the highest degree of market power in decades.

First, members acknowledged that both current prices and physical market signals justified a production hike, with a consensus quickly emerging that they would ease cuts by an additional 2 MMbpd between August and December at a pace of 400 kbpd each month. Second, members widely accepted that the current agreement, scheduled to conclude April 2022, should be extended through end-2022&#8212;widely accepted, but not unanimous.</p><p>Instead, the UAE emerged as a spoiler, refusing to support an extension of the current deal without changes to the baseline against which the cuts are measured. The UAE has invested substantially in its industry since the current baseline was established in October 2018 and now wants an alternative baseline reflecting April 2020 production, a time when members pumped unrestrained amidst the battle for market share and therefore is arguably more representative of current production capacities.</p><p>The UAE has a logical argument here. It is the second-largest producer behind Saudi Arabia to have averaged steeper-than-required cuts to-date and holds the largest deviation between the current baseline and demonstrated April 2020 production capacity within the alliance&#8212;83% vs 94% for Saudi Arabia and 104% for Russia. Its position is hardly unassailable, however, and it should be noted that the UAE&#8217;s capacity expansion investments occurred entirely while under a formal production restraint deal. </p><p>In response to the UAE opposition, Saudi Arabia drew a line in the sand that there would be no production hike without an extension of the deal (i.e., no first resolution without the second resolution). The discord emerging at what were supposed to be relatively straightforward meetings surprised observers, dragging on for days and concluding suddenly after a tumultuous weekend with parties walking away without a deal. </p><p>Why would Saudi Arabia draw such a line in the sand, especially when a re-basing would also benefit the Kingdom? Aside from a principle-of-the-matter opposition, Russia would have ended up on the wrong side of an April 2020 re-basing and Riyadh has shown a willingness to go out of its way to keep Moscow in the production pact.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F405b4cfc-4958-4634-9267-f147550f1ac1_4749x2711.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F405b4cfc-4958-4634-9267-f147550f1ac1_4749x2711.png" width="1456" height="831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/405b4cfc-4958-4634-9267-f147550f1ac1_4749x2711.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:831,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:839771,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F405b4cfc-4958-4634-9267-f147550f1ac1_4749x2711.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F405b4cfc-4958-4634-9267-f147550f1ac1_4749x2711.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F405b4cfc-4958-4634-9267-f147550f1ac1_4749x2711.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F405b4cfc-4958-4634-9267-f147550f1ac1_4749x2711.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>While failed OPEC negotiations have historically resulted in a production surge and crashing prices as members rush to get their barrels to market (e.g., the aforementioned April 2020 price war), this time appears different.

This means no production hikes, less supply to the market, and higher prices&#8212;at least for time being.

The longer it takes, the greater the risks of reawakening US shale investment or damaging the global economic recovery. In the meantime, the UAE and Saudi Arabia continue to play chicken, with enough spare capacity to sink the oil market twice over. The entire oil market will be on much more stable footing once these erstwhile allies get back on the same page.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Oil Market is Super Tightâ€”But Also Not at All]]></title><description><![CDATA[Prices are rising fast but crude markets are far from healthy]]></description><link>https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/the-oil-market-is-super-tightbut</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://commoditycontext.substack.com/p/the-oil-market-is-super-tightbut</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Rory Johnston]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2021 13:25:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F886a427b-3994-46ac-bbea-e8b19c13baed_4749x2711.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F886a427b-3994-46ac-bbea-e8b19c13baed_4749x2711.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F886a427b-3994-46ac-bbea-e8b19c13baed_4749x2711.png" width="1456" height="831" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/886a427b-3994-46ac-bbea-e8b19c13baed_4749x2711.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:831,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:914977,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F886a427b-3994-46ac-bbea-e8b19c13baed_4749x2711.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F886a427b-3994-46ac-bbea-e8b19c13baed_4749x2711.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F886a427b-3994-46ac-bbea-e8b19c13baed_4749x2711.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F886a427b-3994-46ac-bbea-e8b19c13baed_4749x2711.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Oil prices have rocketed back above $75 a barrel for the first time since 2018, bullish sentiment abounds, and market commentators are talking seriously about $100 oil for the first time since 2014 on the combination of resurgent demand and slower, less-responsive supply. &nbsp;</p><p>But what are the data telling us about how tight the current oil market is, really?</p><p>In short: Bullish outlooks rest on the fact that demand for crude is currently outstripping production, inventories are falling fast while non-OPEC production growth looks challenged going forward.
