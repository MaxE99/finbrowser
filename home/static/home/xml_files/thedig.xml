Someone told Dave about the SEC investigation and he had the exclusive and likely exclusive follow-ups. Someone wanted this investigation to be known, but the SEC and the audit firms are not yet talking about it publicly. Second, the investigation is being led out of Miami.</p><blockquote><p>The SEC&#8217;s Miami office last year sent letters seeking information about client work that could cause auditors to violate rules requiring they be independent of clients whose finances they inspect, sources say. They say the letters were sent to some smaller accounting firms as well as the big four: Deloitte &amp; Touche,&nbsp;Ernst &amp; Young,&nbsp;KPMG&nbsp;and&nbsp;PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p></blockquote><p>The Big 4 firms either declined to comment or ignored his requests for comment.</p><blockquote><p>Spokesmen for the SEC,&nbsp;KPMG&nbsp;and PwC declined to comment. A spokeswoman for&nbsp;Ernst &amp; Young&nbsp;and a spokesman for &#173;Deloitte&nbsp;did not respond to requests for comment.</p></blockquote><p>Michaels says in his story that the SEC&#8217;s Miami office asked the audit firms for information about all non-audit services for audit clients &#8212;&nbsp;information that is readily available to the SEC via issuer proxies, the PCAOB inspection data gathering process, and research firm Audit Analytics &#8212;&nbsp;but also for information on any cases in which the firms obtained contracts that reimburse them for losses caused by lawsuits over their work, or made fees contingent on a particular result or outcome, the sources say.</p><p>Typically a high profile investigation, one that touches the core of the Big 4, would be led by SEC HQ in DC. For example, the PwC independence-related enforcement action that Dave mentions, where PwC paid $7.9 million in fines, was led by two SEC attorneys who are both <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2019-184">based in Washington, D.C..</a></p><p>The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2014-12">2014 KPMG case</a> Dave mentions, where the firm paid $ 8.2 million to settle an SEC investigation that alleged it provided prohibited non-audit services such as book&#173;keeping to affiliates of audit clients included <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/investreport/34-71390.pdf">a report of a non-prosecuted investigation</a> that was a direct result of my reporting.</p><blockquote><p>It&#8217;s been almost three years since&nbsp;<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/francinemckenna/2011/03/29/ge-auditor-kpmg-supporting-their-tax-strategy-for-102-years/print/">I first broke the story of KPMG&#8217;s loaned tax staff arrangement with audit client GE</a>. On January 24 the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370540667080?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%253A+sec%252FlgHO+%28SEC.gov+Updates%253A+Press+Releases%29#.UufyE_bnYy4">announced&nbsp;</a>an $8.2 million settlement with KPMG over violations of auditor-independence rules. KPMG&#8217;s settlement includes pay back of some fees earned on the illegal services and some fines. The wheels of justice turn very slowly. Unfortunately, none of the companies involved were named and, as far as I can see, the GE case was&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2014/34-71389.pdf">not one of the three cited</a>&nbsp;as a subject of the enforcement&#8230;</p><p>A person familiar with the SEC&#8217;s thinking on the matter confirmed to me that the investigation report is referring to the GE case. This person also pointed to the SEC&#8217;s earlier independence case against KPMG for violations in its Australia practice for clues as to why the agency did not issue an enforcement order here. I discussed the Australia case in my&nbsp;<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/francinemckenna/2012/01/24/kpmg-no-longer-loaning-tax-staff-to-ge/">original reporting.</a></p><blockquote><p>KPMG should know better. KPMG was recently&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2011/34-63987.pdf">sanctioned by the SEC</a>&nbsp;for a similar transgression involving their Australian office. KPMG Australia and at least one other KPMG member firm outside Australia&nbsp;<strong>seconded non-tax professional staff</strong>&nbsp;to work at each client&#8217;s premises, under the supervision and direction of each client, doing the same types of work that each client&#8217;s own employees or managers ordinarily would perform, in violation of the prohibition under Rule 201(c)(4)(vi) against &#8220;[a]citing, temporarily or permanently, as a director, officer, or employee of an audit client, or performing any decision-making, supervisory, or ongoing monitoring function for the audit client.&#8221;</p></blockquote></blockquote><p></p><p>EY and its professionals have paid fines for quite a few auditor independence enforcement actions since the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley in 2002.</p><p>There&#8217;s one just this past December 2021 that specifically involved tax professionals billing on a contingent basis for services to an audit client. </p><blockquote><p>The SEC's orders find that tax professionals at EY billed public company Cintas Corporation for contingent fees for non-audit tax services for approximately nine years, despite EY also being hired to audit Cintas.</p></blockquote><p>Despite the SEC saying that the result of these violations was that the firm was not independent of is audit client, the SEC did not hold the firm responsible for the actions of two partners and one manager, two of whom were attorneys. That investigation was also led by <a href="https://www.sec.gov/enforce/34-93749-s">Washington D.C. -based </a>SEC attorneys. </p><p>Contingent billing to audit clients is a really big no-no and, as I mentioned, Dave&#8217;s story says the SEC wants to know more about these situations, if they exist at other firms. </p><p>There&#8217;s another EY independence enforcement action from the summer of 2021 &#8212; there were two in one year &#8212; where the SEC charged EY, one of its partners, and two of its former partners with &#8220;improper professional conduct for violating auditor independence rules&#8221; for rigging the bid the firm was making for the company&#8217;s audit. EY agreed to a censure, to a penalty of $10 million &#8212; a bit more than the typical firm penalty of around $8-9 million &#8212;  and to &#8220;comply with a detailed set of undertakings for a period of two years.&#8221; That investigation, also, was <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-144">led by a veteran SEC HQ D.C. -based attorney</a>. </p><p>And then there&#8217;s the time in 2016 where the SEC fined EY $9.3 million to settle charges that &#8220;two of the firm&#8217;s audit partners got too close to their clients on a personal level and violated rules that ensure firms maintain their objectivity and impartiality during audits.&#8221; That investigation was <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-187.html">driven out of New York</a>.</p><p>Dave&#8217;s story mentions a 2014 enforcement action where the SEC accused EY of lobbying congressional staff on behalf of two audit clients.&nbsp;That was an <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2014-136">SEC HQ D.C. sourced investigation with a fine of only $4 million. </a></p><p>It&#8217;s no wonder SEC Enforcement Director Gurbir Grewal said in December at the <a href="https://thedig.substack.com/p/heres-a-target-list-for-if-sec-enforcement?s=w">AICPA SEC and PCAOB update conference</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The third thing I'll highlight and I've spoken about this in other conferences is about increasing our penalties when historical penalty amounts are not having the desired deterrent effect. Quite often, when we see these independence cases in particular, very skilled defense attorney on the other side come in. I will sit at a table like this one and they'll show us a list of other resolutions and other independence cases, and they'll say, &#8220;Okay, it was a one-year suspension. In that case, it was $20,000,&#8221; and give us five other examples of similar conduct with similar penalties.</p><p>In my mind, as someone who's trying to deter this type of conduct, that doesn't work. That's just showing me that, you know, dear Mr. Defense Counsel, that just makes it apparent to me that that penalty is not having the desired deterrent fact, and that we need to up our penalties. <em><strong>So I think you will see us really ratcheting up penalties where appropriate so they do have that desired deterrent effect, particularly in these auditor independence cases. Because, you know, there's almost a static penalty amount and it's sometimes viewed as a cost of doing business.

Or is it bankers&#8217; self-interested risk calculations that drive them to point the SEC and Department of Justice towards clients who may already be under heavy scrutiny?</p><p><strong>JPMorgan snitches on entertainment industry royalty</strong></p><p>On March 8, Jeffrey Trachtenberg and Dave Michaels at the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-probes-options-trade-that-gained-on-microsoft-activision-deal-11646787000">hugely scooped</a> that the Justice Department is investigating options trades by Barry Diller, David Geffen and Alexander von Furstenburg to determine if they violated insider-trading laws. The&nbsp;SEC&nbsp;is also conducting its own investigation.</p><blockquote><p>Messrs. Diller, von Furstenberg and Geffen bought options to purchase&nbsp;Activision&nbsp;shares at $40 each on Jan. 14 in privately arranged transactions through&nbsp;JPMorgan Chase, the people said.&nbsp;Activision&nbsp;shares were trading around $63 at the time, meaning the options were already profitable to exercise, or "in the money." Option holders could reap more if&nbsp;Activision's stock price rose.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Apparently, the three amigos &#8212; actually, von Furstenburg is Diller&#8217;s stepson with Diane von Furstenburg &#8212; purchased the options just days before the merger between Microsoft and Activision was announced.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal says Diller and Geffen are longtime friends, having worked together in the mail room at the William Morris agency back in the day. Diller has served on the board of directors of&nbsp;Coca-Cola Co. with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/state-federal-regulators-expand-activision-workplace-misconduct-probes-11645146474?mod=search_headline">besieged</a> Activision&nbsp;Chief Executive&nbsp;Bobby Kotick.&nbsp;Kotick has now stepped down from the Coca-Cola board amidst multiple federal and state regulatory investigations into how&nbsp;he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-blizzard-pushes-out-dozens-of-employees-over-workplace-misconduct-11642428001?mod=article_inline&amp;mod=article_inline">handled workplace misconduct claims</a>. The Activision acquisition may help to bury those allegations and the impact of any settlements in the belly of a beast as big as Microsoft.</p><p>Diller described Kotick, according to the WSJ, as "a long-time friend,&#8221; but said that that their perfect timing was, &#8220;simply a lucky bet. We acted on no information of any kind from anyone. It is one of those coincidences."</p><p>The options were not purchased on an exchange but were bespoke, arranged privately by&nbsp;JPMorgan. The WSJ says that after the deal between Microsoft and Activision became public, JPMorgan&nbsp;reported the trades to law enforcement.</p><p>JPMorgan&#8217;s report is an aggressive approach to risk managing clients whose business may come back to bite the bank, but it&#8217;s not wrong.</p><p>JPMorgan may be watching its p&#8217;s and q&#8217;s because it remains under scrutiny for, amongst other activities, its own toe-dip into market-manipulation of metals futures and Treasury securities. Under the terms of a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/jp-morgan-spoofing-penalty-idINKBN26K325">$920 million multi-agency </a><em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/jp-morgan-spoofing-penalty-idINKBN26K325">criminal </a></em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/jp-morgan-spoofing-penalty-idINKBN26K325">settlement</a> it reached in September 2020, the bank&nbsp;is required during the term of a deferred prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice &#8212;&nbsp;it also settled charges with the SEC and CFTC &#8212; to disclose any evidence or concerns about its own or clients&#8217; misconduct to law enforcement. JPMorgan untypically admitted its guilt when it agreed to the settlements.</p><p>We see now what happens when a bank doesn&#8217;t report a whistleblower&#8217;s concerns to DOJ while under multiple settlement agreements. <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/banks-are-being-punished-again-and-again-to-no-avail">I wrote 10 years ago</a> that Deutsche Bank is a serial recidivist and I am still not wrong.</p><blockquote><p><strong>WSJ: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/deutsche-bank-violates-doj-settlement-agrees-to-extend-outside-monitor-11647016959">Deutsche Bank Violates DOJ Settlement, Agrees to Extend Outside Monitor </a></strong><em>Violation is related to internal complaint in its asset-management arm&#8217;s sustainable-investing business</em></p><p>The bank had ongoing disclosure and compliance obligations as part of a&nbsp;2021 criminal settlement&nbsp;related to&nbsp;Deutsche Bank's involvement in overseas corruption and market manipulation by futures traders. That deal required&nbsp;Deutsche Bank&nbsp;to pay $130 million, but <em><strong>the settlement allowed it to avoid indictment in exchange for staying out of trouble for three years and flagging future potential problems to prosecutors.</strong></em></p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported in December that&nbsp;the DOJ had informed Deutsche Bank&nbsp;of the possible violation, although it hadn't made a final decision.</p><p><em><strong>As a result of the violation,&nbsp;Deutsche Bank&nbsp;agreed to extend the term of an outside compliance monitor</strong></em> that dates to a different settlement with the DOJ reached in 2015 over manipulation of benchmark interest rates. <em><strong>The monitor will now be in place until February 2023.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p></p><p>Activision doesn&#8217;t like to follow SEC accounting/disclosure rules, either. <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-activision-blizzard-is-using-the-media-to-skirt-sec-rules-2017-08-08?mod=article_inline">I wrote in August of 2017</a> that after receiving a letter from the SEC in 2016 that said it had to drop revenue deferral figures from its non-GAAP numbers &#8212; the earnings-report figures that do not comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP &#8212; Activision instead asked journalists to calculate the figures from info it provided in an email and publish the regulator-prohibited adjusted revenue numbers that Activision was prohibited from providing. &nbsp;</p><p>These option trades seem too good to be true to me, too. The scenario is similar to the lucky bets Dean Food Chairman Tom Davis, gambler Billy Walters, and golfer Phil Mickelson made based on Davis&#8217;s inside information back in 2017. <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-it-was-easy-for-investigators-to-find-the-dean-foods-insider-trades-2016-05-19">I wrote:</a></p><blockquote><p>Sara Kropf, an attorney who defends white collar defendants, says the SEC sometimes gets tips about insider trading, but it looks like this time it used market surveillance tools to investigate Walters.</p><p>&#8220;Unfortunately for Walters, it appears that he engaged in large, successful trades with respect to a single company&#8217;s stock. If he had a limited history trading that company or others over the period, then that can raise suspicions,&#8221; said Kropf.</p><p>Walters&#8217; trades were very large compared to the average daily trading volume in Dean Foods and Darden. They were also consistently successful on the up- and downside over more than six years.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/former-dean-foods-chairman-sentenced-to-two-years-in-prison-for-insider-trading-1508448589">WSJ reported</a> in 2017 that Davis was sentenced to two years in prison in 2017. He also pleaded guilty to perjury because he lied to the&nbsp;SEC&nbsp;by denying his involvement in the conspiracy. Walters invoked his Fifth Amendment rights, declined to testify, was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison. </p><blockquote><p>Mr. Davis cooperated with prosecutors and testified for five days at Mr. Walters's trial as the star government witness&#8230; Mr. Davis has said he started cooperating with the government after a series of health scares in late 2015 gave him perspective and made him want to take responsibility for his conduct.</p><p>At trial, the defense tried to undermine Mr. Davis by portraying him as a liar. Mr. Walters's lawyers produced phone records that showed frequent calls from Mr. Davis to escort services, saying this conflicted with Mr. Walters's statements to the government that he had not paid for sex while he was with his third wife. She has since filed for divorce.</p><p>One of the most valuable parts of Mr. Davis's cooperation was the details he shared about a burner phone that Mr. Walters gave him to share tips. Mr. Walters allegedly called it the "bat phone" and told Mr. Davis to refer to Dean Foods&nbsp;as the&nbsp;Dallas Cowboys.</p></blockquote><p></p><p><strong>JPMorgan sues Tesla</strong></p><p>It came as a surprise to most Tesla watchers, if not all, that JPMorgan would sue Tesla over a measly $162 million. Well, maybe not everyone was surprised. The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jpmorgans-jamie-dimon-and-teslas-elon-musk-feud-behind-the-scenes-11637586001">WSJ&#8217;s David Benoit reported</a> in November that, &#8220;Elon Musk&nbsp;and&nbsp;Jamie Dimon&nbsp;don't get along.&#8221;</p><p>Benoit explained back when the lawsuit was filed that it&#8217;s rare in the self-serving world of banking to cut off a hand just because it spasmodically slaps your face.</p><blockquote><p>Typically, bankers seek to avoid public fights with big clients and even potential clients, anxious about winning fees and worried the slightest insult could cost them access.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>But this is a battle of bigger-than-life personalities.</p><blockquote><p>Both chief executives are commanding presences inside their companies and industries. And both have had public fights with rivals or sharp words for critics and regulators, though Mr. Dimon has often wound up expressing regret over what he admits are uncareful slips while Mr. Musk has rarely backed down.</p></blockquote><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>On March 2, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/jpmorgans-162-mln-fight-with-tesla-simple-contract-case-or-revenge-plot-2022-03-02/">Alison Frankel of Reuters</a> provided a status for the dispute.</p><blockquote><p>JPMorgan advised U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe of Manhattan in a&nbsp;<a href="https://tmsnrt.rs/35IPg4w">letter brief</a>&nbsp;last week that it intends to file a motion for judgment on the pleadings. As you know, that&#8217;s an unusual procedural tactic, seeking a final determination based only on the lawsuit's opening complaint and answer to it. But JPMorgan&#8217;s lawyers at Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell told the judge that this is the rare case that can be decided on admitted facts and long-established contract law precedent.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Not so fast, says Tesla.</p><blockquote><p>But Tesla&#8217;s lawyers at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan, in a vivid and accusatory&nbsp;<a href="https://tmsnrt.rs/3ts5MOu">response</a>&nbsp;filed on Tuesday, said it&#8217;s anything but. The Quinn filing talks about a &#8220;brazenly self-serving&#8221; scheme by JPMorgan to wrest an &#8220;improper windfall&#8221; from Tesla, on top of the billions of dollars of shares the automaker delivered to the bank when the 2014 warrants expired.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Frankel goes on to say that Tesla &#8220;posits a baroque theory of the case, in which high-ranking JPMorgan executives saw the warrants deal as an opportunity to exact revenge against Tesla and Musk for icing JPMorgan out of profitable finance and underwriting assignments,&#8221; according to earlier <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/tesla-countersues-jpmorgan-over-contract-affected-by-musk-tweet-2022-01-24">reporting&nbsp;</a>by Jonathan Stempel&nbsp;in January. &nbsp;</p><p>Benoit at the WSJ <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jpmorgans-jamie-dimon-and-teslas-elon-musk-feud-behind-the-scenes-11637586001">described the tension</a> in November:</p><blockquote><p>Mr. Musk has spurned Mr. Dimon's&nbsp;JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. for years, turning to other banks while expanding&nbsp;Tesla Inc. and his broader empire. Conversations over the years between the two companies have often upset one side or the other, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>JPMorgan's investment bankers haven't worked on any Tesla offering or transaction since 2016, according to public records.</p><p>When&nbsp;JPMorgan&nbsp;worked on Tesla's 2010 initial public offering of stock and several capital-markets transactions in the following years, it was usually ranked behind rivals such as&nbsp;Goldman Sachs Group and&nbsp;Morgan Stanley.</p><p>JPMorgan&nbsp;has been paid about $15 million by Tesla for advice and capital-markets work in the past decade, while&nbsp;Goldman Sachs&nbsp;has made about $90 million, according to Dealogic.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What isn&#8217;t described by the WSJ or Reuters is that PwC, as their auditor, has been making billions off all three &#8212;&nbsp;Tesla, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs &#8212;&nbsp;for years, and years. And now PwC is presiding over a mismatch in valuation and significant litigation over a transaction &#8212;&nbsp;one Goldman Sachs advised on&#8212;&nbsp;between two of its clients.</p><p><a href="https://thedig.substack.com/p/pwc-between-a-rock-and-a-hard-place?s=w">I wrote about it</a> shortly after the lawsuit was filed in November.</p><blockquote><p>The kicker here, and the most interesting part for me, is that it appears that Tesla and JPM were recording this transaction at different valuations since August 2018, when the&nbsp;First Adjustment&nbsp;occurred.&nbsp;PwC is the external auditor for both Tesla and JPM.</p></blockquote><p>But that&#8217;s not all&#8230; <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-08-08/elon-musk-has-some-fun-with-tesla?sref=1kJVNqnU">[Matt] Levine writes</a>:</p><blockquote><p>It&#8217;s worth saying that JPMorgan was one of four banks that acted as Tesla&#8217;s counterparties on the warrant transactions for this convertible bond deal. Did the&nbsp;other&nbsp;banks&nbsp;[<em>fm note: such as Goldman Sachs</em>] adjust their warrants to give themselves more shares for Musk&#8217;s pretend going-private deal? Apparently not.</p><p>Here&#8217;s a grudging footnote in JPMorgan&#8217;s complaint:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Tesla also claimed that none of its three other warrant dealers had made similar adjustments. But Tesla has never substantiated that claim.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>On August 13, Musk tweeted, &#8220;I&#8217;m excited to work with Silver Lake and Goldman Sachs as financial advisors, plus Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz and Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson as legal advisors, on the proposal to take Tesla private.&#8221;</p><p>In a footnote to its complaint, JPM says that, according to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/staying-public">Tesla August 24 blog post</a>, two of Tesla&#8217;s other warrant dealers, including Goldman Sachs, were advising Musk on his going-private proposal.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>After I wrote about PwC presiding over mismatched books books and litigation between its two clients, Tesla and JPMorgan,  I got this comment from a former SEC official, a veteran expert in financial accounting and reporting:</p><blockquote><p>[Here&#8217;s] why the accounting might not match up. It isn&#8217;t all that surprising that JPM would mark its purchased option to market while Tesla would not need to remeasure the written option, as these options often qualify for equity classification for the issuer, while the holder must do derivative accounting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What I can&#8217;t explain is how they wound up disagreeing over the settlement requirements.&nbsp;These things are common transactions and I can&#8217;t imagine that it would actually be unclear whether the option was in the money or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p></p><p><strong>GE&#8217;s Biggest Bear -</strong> <strong>Stephen Tusa, JPMorgan sell-side analyst </strong></p><p>Stephen Tusa asks the questions no one else will.</p><p>In their book, <em><a href="https://www.bookcellarinc.com/lights-out-pride-delusion-and-fall-general-electric">Lights Out: Pride, Delusion, and The Fall of General Electric</a></em><a href="https://www.bookcellarinc.com/lights-out-pride-delusion-and-fall-general-electric">,</a> The Wall Street Journal&#8217;s Thomas Gryta and Ted Mann open Chapter 17, &#8220;Enter the Bear,&#8221; with this:</p><blockquote><p>Like any modern bank, JPMorgan Chase had to juggle its interests.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Gryta and Mann go on to remind us that &#8220;inherent conflicts of interest embedded in the Wall Street research models employed by massive banks had supposedly been corrected by a $1.4 billion settlement with regulators in 2003.&#8221;&nbsp; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/28/business/regulators-finalize-14-billion-wall-st-settlement.html">That&#8217;s the settlement </a>where ten Wall Street investment banks, including JPMorgan, agreed to &nbsp;stop issuing biased stock ratings to attract investment banking business. It&#8217;s also the one where <a href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1mpnkdvcmpcp9/Henry-Blodget-Was-Banned-From-the-Financial-Industry-So-He-Built-a-Financial-Media-Empire">Henry Blodget</a>, then of Merrill Lynch, and <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2002-11-25-0211250204-story.html">Jack Grubman</a>, then of Citigroup's brokerage business Salomon Smith Barney, agreed to pay $19 million in fines and penalties and be banned permanently from the securities industry, but not admit nor deny any wrongdoing, to settle fraud charges.</p><p>When Tusa developed doubts about GE&#8217;s financial disclosures in 2008, before the breadth of the problems it would encounter during the financial crisis period were fully known, he ran up against JPMorgan&#8217;s significant banking relationship with GE led by James Bainbridge &#8220;Jimmy&#8221; Lee.</p><p>Tusa gets a lot of credit in my book for following his heart all these years on GE. He had an &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on the stock in the early days of the financial crisis but when GE missed its earnings target he dropped it to &#8220;neutral&#8221;.</p><p>&#8220;It would appear as though accountability for hitting targets is the top priority, and some managers may be chasing earnings,&#8221; Tusa wrote to clients in a note.</p><p>Fast forward to 2016, Tusa issued <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2016/05/12/jpm-resumes-general-electric-with-underweight.html">the first &#8220;sell&#8221; rating on </a>GE by a major bank analyst in recent memory.</p><p>Over the next two years GE would lose more than $200 billion in market value. &nbsp;</p><p>In May of 2017, GE CEO Jeff Immelt spoke to an industry group in Sarasota, Florida and said that a $2 per share earning target for 2018 was a reach and that significant cost cutting would have to occur for the company to have a chance to achieve it. The analysts in attendance, in particular JPMorgan&#8217;s Steve Tusa, were shook, according to an account in Gryta&#8217;s and Mann&#8217;s book. Tusa had been telling his clients to sell GE and he asked Immelt about his succession plans, a hugely taboo subject to discuss openly.&nbsp;</p><p>On a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ge-shocks-market-with-multibillion-dollar-loss-in-legacy-reinsurance-business-2018-01-16">conference call in Jan. 2018</a>, after GE announced the life-threatening fourth quarter after-tax charge of $6.2 billion and a $3 billion cash capital contribution to its insurance subsidiary that was expected to grow to $15 billion by 2024, Tusa even asked about the auditors!&nbsp; </p><p>Tusa posed the question to then-CFO Jamie Miller of whether the company was happy with KPMG, given the huge charge related to aggressive accounting estimates.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>If these guys reviewed this stuff every year for the last several years and this is kind of a result of that, doesn&#8217;t that kind of raise questions?</p></blockquote><p>John Flannery, who replaced Immelt in June 2017, told the attendees that he was not planning an auditor change.</p><p>In September of 2018 GE announced it had issues with its turbine business. A couple of weeks later, on October 1, CEO Flannery was fired. Flannery had admitted to the board the prior week that GE would miss its year-end targets and have to take a $23 billion charge related to write-downs of acquisitions by the power business, including <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2019/01/17/how-the-american-takeover-of-a-french-national-champion-became-intertwined-in-a-corruption-investigation">Alstom</a>.</p><p>Larry Culp was now CEO.</p><p>In <a href="https://thedig.substack.com/p/if-markets-move-on-stories-and-momentum?s=w">February of 2019</a>, Tusa told CNBC GE &#8220;stock could go up based on narrative and sentiment,&#8221; because no one was reading the 10-K which suggested much weaker fundamentals.

For now, as Churchill described the actions of Russia in 1939, &#8220;it is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.&#8221;</p><p>Two weeks into the increasingly bloody morass of Vladimir Putin&#8217;s &#8220;special military operation,&#8221; however, there can be these observations:</p><ul><li><p>The largest six networks (as of this writing) have acted to join an ever-expanding <a href="https://som.yale.edu/story/2022/over-300-companies-have-withdrawn-russia-some-remain">list</a> of firms and companies, public and private, choosing the right side of history by withdrawing from Russia.</p></li><li><p>Which said, the accounting networks&#8217; structures and the nature of the Big Audit model &#8211;- both differing fundamentally from those of the world&#8217;s largest corporations and the lawyers, consultants and other professional service providers &#8211; mean that in actual practice the impact is likely to be minimal.</p></li><li><p>Once beyond the immediate optics and a modest amount of house-keeping, the ease and speed with which these amputations were carried out suggest that future distress scenarios should be seen as dire.<a href="#_ftn1" title="">[1]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Grant Thornton led on <a href="https://www.grantthornton.global/en/press/press-releases-2022/fbk-leaves-the-grant-thornton-network/">March 1</a>, and then the terminations came raining down &#8211;- PwC and KPMG, EY, Deloitte as the last of the Big Four, and BDO on March 9. The pack of red cards lagged business cessation announcements by McKinsey, Apple, Nike, and a partial but <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/eversheds-sutherland-is-latest-global-law-firm-exit-moscow-2022-03-09/">growing list</a> of the large law firms, although ahead of giants in the consumer sector &#8212; McDonalds, Coca-Cola and Starbucks &#8212; and lately even bankers Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase.</p><p>Their public face was one of collegial amiability; if couched as divorces, they would anticipate future reconciliation or re-engagement. EY&#8217;s press release offered comfort that the &#8220;EY global organization assured that it would provide assistance to Russian employees.&#8221; PwC Russia put it that, &#8220;This transition is expected to be smooth and the PwC Global leadership team has stressed that it would make every effort to support our Russian colleagues and firm through the process.&#8221; &nbsp;</p><p>Looking ahead, the tone of the announcements fairly brimmed with confidence:</p><ul><li><p>PwC stated that, &#8220;The principles and rules of working with clients in Russia will remain unchanged.&#8221;</p></li><li><p>Over at EY, &#8220;EY Russian practice is providing and will continue to provide services to all its clients in accordance with high quality standards based on international methodologies developed by the global organization, which will continue to provide methodological support to Russian practice.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>The basic organization of the large networks portended the up-beat tone. As well enough known but seldom scrutinized, they are assemblages of distinct and separate legal entities, organized and providing client services at the local country level to comply with the local nature of the profession&#8217;s regulation. They are, for the most part, various types of private partnerships, owned by their local partners who share profits and losses at that level. They do not have outside third-party capital, a corporate &#8220;parent,&#8221; or a top-level &#8220;holding company,&#8221; although most have some form of non-practicing administrative entity that is inserted into a complex web of inter-firm contractual agreements to facilitate the handling of intellectual property, methodology sharing, quality oversight, personnel transfers and the like.</p><p>Very little need change to maintain the status quo. Daily life at both the newly-outcast Russian firms and their <em>quondam</em> colleagues ex-Russia will evolve in ways that are both marginal and limited. That&#8217;s especially as compared to the disruption being caused by outside forces, as the array of Western sanctions on companies and individuals both Russia-based and doing business there looks expansive, targeted, and significant.</p><p>Those effects, however, would befall the accounting networks and firms whether the Russian members were in or out.</p><ul><li><p>Employees of the newly-isolated Russian firms will continue to work the same jobs, at the same locations and under the same leaders as before.</p></li><li><p>The fortunes of the Russian partners will continue to depend on their on-going local practices &#8211;- although as noted, impacted by Western sanctions &#8211;- but not radically different from under the large networks&#8217; localized compensation ethos of &#8220;eat-what-you-kill.&#8221;</p></li><li><p>Change management will be trivial. Clients and other interested parties will have received the news of the Russian firms&#8217; status almost instantaneously. With marginal effect in the marketplace, the firms&#8217; publicity resources will be occupied briefly with revised branding announcements, re-labelled publications, website re-designs and the issuance of new business cards.</p></li></ul><p>Nor is there any reason to doubt the limited nature and scope of the impact on the execution of Big Audit engagements. For these, there are two aspects:</p><ul><li><p>An audit firm in Russia, engaged by a client based there and having international operations, would always have relied on its collegial network member firms to perform any necessary non-Russia work. That need will continue, although under the global-level assurances of on-going cross-border amity, it will be uninhibited by the cosmetics of separation (while, as noted, very possibly affected by the sanctions regimes).</p></li><li><p>Symmetrically, the auditor of a non-Russia company with operations in Russia will have relied traditionally on its member firm there to audit and report on the local results. Again, going forward (and noting that the audits of companies exiting or halting their Russian business may now have to address the accounting for operating losses or discontinued operations), the local Russian firm would presumably be available to be engaged at arm&#8217;s-length &#8212; deploying its personnel and relying on the non-Russia referring firm to provide technical consultation and methodology guidance, just as a large network has always done to secure services in a country where it might not have its own network member. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>So far, very likely all well and good, if lacking in drama &#8212; save for this: when the violence has ended, and the dust of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict has settled, both literal and figurative, a dark and subtle message lurks beneath the surface.</p><p>Consider that the large audit networks have thrived on messages emphasizing the scope and strength of their international structures, and their capacity at scale to deliver seamless and efficient services to the participants in the global capital markets.</p><p>Those messages have persisted, despite an emphatic signal delivered in 2002, when the Arthur Andersen network collapsed in a matter of weeks. This occurred even though it was the most profitable and tightly-organized, with its partners enjoying the only globally integrated results-sharing model in the profession&#8217;s entire history.&nbsp;</p><p>Which is to say &#8212; the largest six networks have now shown the capacity to surgically excise their Russian member firms, voluntarily and in a matter of days. That suggests &#8212; under-cutting the messaging of network unification as robust and tightly-bound (and shifting metaphors) &#8212; that the &#8220;ties that bind&#8221; may only be attached with slip-knots, or are spun of gossamer, able to being broken or snipped in an eye-blink by the scissors of exigent events.</p><p>I have long argued that the under-appreciated lesson in Andersen&#8217;s precipitous fall was that, far from being &#8220;too big to fail&#8221;,  the surviving Big Four tetrapoly is &#8220;too fragile to survive.&#8221;<a href="#_ftn2" title="">[2]</a></p><p>That <em>every one</em> of these large networks was able to cut loose a member firm of significant size, swiftly and without obvious discord or repercussions, does not inspire confidence that a similar fate would not befall an organization under the stress of a government sanction or a litigation judgment at a level &#8212; easily foreseeable, given <a href="https://www.tafsattorneys.com/pwc-ordered-to-pay-625m-over-colonial-bank-collapse/">the size of recent well-known corporate failures</a> &#8212; that would threaten the limited depth of its capital structure and its individual partners&#8217; resources.</p><p>Modifying network structures that have included Russian member firms, over to on-going relationships with now free-standing Russian local firms, should work smoothly enough, considering the size of the Russian economy in an overall global context.

Trump for the years ending June 30, 2011 through June 30, 2020 <em><strong>&#8220;should no longer be relied upon&#8221;</strong></em> and that Trump Organization should inform anyone who received those documents and may be relying on them to no longer do so.</p><p>Mazars wrote that although the firm had not &#8220;as a whole&#8221; found material discrepancies between the information the Trump Organization provided and the actual value of Mr. Trump&#8217;s assets, &#8220;the totality of circumstances&#8221; that include Mazars&#8217; own investigation required it to now notify anyone who had received the statements that they should no longer rely on them. </p><p>The &#8220;non-reliance&#8221; letter and evidence of Mazars&#8217; resignation as a service provider to the Trump Organization and Donald Trump, personally, were revealed in <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=KBtrXdSMDOM/z_PLUS_toDnNAjw==">a filing by Letitia James</a>, the Attorney General of the State of New York in the Supreme Court of the State of New York on January 18, 2022.

Another firm, Whitley Penn LLP, compiled the June 30, 2021 statement and the Trumps are also looming for a new firm to finish its tax returns for 2021.</p><p>Key in the letter from Mazars to the Trump Organization was a statement that the firm would cease doing any more work for the Trumps and the Trump Organization because, &#8220;We have also reached the point such that there is a non-waivable conflict of interest with the Trump Organization.&#8221; </p><p>That means Mazars believes it is now in a position that is adverse to its client, perhaps as a result of being sued along with its client and acting as a cooperating witness against its client.</p><p>The Trump organization is a private company not a public one, so its accounting firm and the services it provides are governed by AICPA standards, not PCAOB standards. However, when auditing a public company, <a href="https://pcaobus.org/oversight/standards/ethics-independence-rules/details/ET101">auditor independence may be compromised</a> when the audit firm and its client or its management &#8220;are in threatened or actual positions of material adverse interests by reason of threatened or actual litigation.&#8221;</p><p>Mazars is a defendant in the NYAG case, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/14/nyregion/mazars-trump-organization-financial-statements.html">reportedly a cooperating witness</a> in a criminal case the New York District Attorney is pursuing against Trump&#8217;s long-serving chief financial officer, Allen H. Weisselberg and the Trump Organization, who were indicted last summer. Weisselberg and the Trump Organization are accused of perpetrating a 15-year scheme to enable tax avoidance by executives and their families on compensation and perquisites provided by Trump. Weisselberg and the Trump Organization have pleaded not guilty and the case is expected to go to trial this summer. </p><p>The New York Attorney General alleges that the Trump Organization financial statements contain exaggerated estimates of Mr. Trump&#8217;s property values. The financial statements are <a href="https://us.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/compilationreview/downloadabledocuments/ar-c-00070-a.pdf">compilations of financial information</a> provided by management, a special kind of &#8220;non-attest&#8221; engagement. As such, the documents are not opinions based on a full financial statement audit, and include a number of disclaimers, including Mazars had not audited or verified any valuations that were incorporated in the numbers. </p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/04/trump-organizations-dishonesty-all-too-common/586366/">Nothing Trump Said Was True</a> | <em>Private companies such as the Trump Organization operate under very lax accounting rules, </em>by David Dayen in The Atlantic in 2019:</p><p>Trump&#8217;s accountants at Mazars freely admitted in legal proceedings quoted in the <em>Post</em> story that all they did was write down numbers Trump supplied. &#8220;In the compilation process, it is not the role of the accountant to assess the values,&#8221; said one accountant in a deposition. &#8220;The value per se does not have to be logical.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Mazars wrote in its letter to the Trump Organization that did &#8220;not express an opinion or provide any assurance about&#8221; the statements and that while compiling the information the firm had even &#8220;become aware of departures from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.&#8221; I was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2022/02/16/why-its-no-surprise-trumps-accounting-firm-is-saying-his-financial-statements-are-unreliable/?sh=3bbaa6077e39">quoted in Forbes</a> on this:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;They were doing their own risk management,&#8221; says Francine McKenna, an accountant and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/francinemckenna/?sh=67e463974f5b" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/francinemckenna/?sh=67e463974f5b">former </a><em><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/francinemckenna/?sh=67e463974f5b" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/francinemckenna/?sh=67e463974f5b">Forbes</a></em><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/francinemckenna/?sh=67e463974f5b" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/francinemckenna/?sh=67e463974f5b"> contributor</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Many people have been surprised that major banks like Deutsche Bank and other lenders seemingly lend hundreds of millions of dollars to Trump over and over again over the years without audited financial statements. It&#8217;s not that unusual.</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/donald-trump-has-had-no-trouble-getting-big-loans-at-competitive-rates-2017-06-22">Donald Trump has had no trouble getting big loans at competitive rates</a>, June 23, 2017, MarketWatch, Francine McKenna</p><p><em><strong>The idea that banks won&#8217;t lend to Trump because of his bankruptcy history is the equivalent of fake news: MarketWatch analysis</strong></em></p><p>A spokesman for Ladder Capital declined to comment on its business relationship with Trump, citing client confidentiality requirements.</p><p>Ladder Capital no longer holds the loans, according to a person familiar with the transactions. That person also said all of the credits are non-recourse &#8212; meaning the lender or investors in the collateralized mortgage debt securities, or CMBS, can pursue the collateral, in this case the properties, but not the borrower in case of default &#8212; and have been securitized. The CMBS that includes the Trump Tower note was rated triple-A.</p><p>Said Thesman: &#8220;It&#8217;s the collateral, and the underlying economics of the deals, not the character of the borrower, that ultimately drives the deal terms.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>And there are always the tax returns, a sensitive topic for Donald Trump who may have provided those instead of audited financials to lenders and others. We don&#8217;t know because the public never saw any tax returns during his administration and Trump has been fighting the public&#8217;s access to any that have been turned over in any of these lawsuits or criminal cases or Congressional investigations. Although <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/27/us/trump-taxes-takeaways.html">the New York Times obtained 17 years </a>worth of returns, we had to take their word for what they said. The actual documents were not made public and any <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/25/nyregion/trump-taxes-vance-supreme-court.html">documents obtained by prosecutors </a>have not been made public, either.</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/review/how-can-you-monitor-borrower-without-financial-statements">How Can You Monitor a Borrower without Financial Statements?</a></p><p><em>Banks don&#8217;t always request financial statements from a borrower&#8212;whether they do depends on their relationship with a borrower and a borrower&#8217;s credit risk.</em></p><p>Chicago Booth Review, June 20, 2014, Francine McKenna</p><p>After a bank loans money to a private company, one that isn't required by regulation to produce financial statements, how does the bank keep tabs on the company's finances? About half the time, a bank monitors a small private company by requesting financial statements, and in other cases it asks for tax returns or proof of creditworthiness. But often the bank doesn't require any financial reporting&#8212;faith and collateral are sufficient.</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thedig.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://thedig.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p></p><p>I received a lot of questions about the number of years &#8212;&nbsp;ten &#8212; of financial statements that Mazars withdrew.  How common is that?</p><p>Not that common.</p><p>When public companies receive an auditor opinion with a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as a result of material errors or fraud that lead to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/accounting-reporting-warrants-issued-spacs">a &#8220;Big R&#8221; restatement</a>, you will see non-reliance statements by the company.  A few quarters or at most a prior year&#8217;s worth of financial statements should not be relied on because they will be restated. When an auditor resigns because of <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130409006217/en/Herbalife-Announcement">an independence violation</a>, perhaps, you may see a non-reliance statement on the auditor&#8217;s opinion, because the new auditor has to do the audit again.</p><p>However, I was reminded as a result of the horrific events of this past week of the invasion of Ukraine by Putin, that nearly 15 years ago, something similar did happen. It was more serious because the situation back then was related to ten years of audits of a listed global company. But the scenario of an auditor resigning because of worries about its own liability based on alleged prosecutorial pressure is eerily similar.  </p><blockquote><p><a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/f18b722c-227a-11dc-ac53-000b5df10621,dwp_uuid=e8477cc4-c820-11db-b0dc-000b5df10621.html">PwC withdraws Yukos audits</a> (This FT story is not available online anymore but a similar one at Reuters is available <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/yukos-pricewaterhousecoopers/pwc-withdraws-reports-for-bankrupt-oil-co-yukos-wsj-idUKN2425040720070624">here</a>.)</p><p><em>&#8220;PwC has withdrawn its entire set of audit reports over 10 years for the bankrupt Yukos oil group, in a move that marks a <strong>significant climbdown </strong>by the global audit firm following months of Russian government pressure.</em></p><p><em>PwC said on Sunday it was withdrawing all its audit reports of Yukos from the years ending 1995 to 2004 because <strong>Russian prosecutors had unearthed new information that led it to believe statements provided by Yukos management in the past &#8220;may not have been accurate&#8221;. </strong>The sudden about-turn comes after a government pressure campaign that included police raids in March on PwC&#8217;s Moscow office and an ongoing criminal investigation into alleged underpayment of taxes by PwC.</em></p></blockquote><p></p><p>A court in Moscow had declared Yukos bankrupt in August 2006 and ordered its assets to be sold.

The prosecutors&#8217; office declined to comment. The tax service is continuing to pursue the case. <strong>PwC&#8217;s decision to withdraw all its Yukos audits from 1995 to 2004 came after months of government pressure </strong>including the tax service case, a police raid on its Moscow office and a criminal investigation into suspected tax evasion by the audit firm itself.</p><p>Its decision, over what it says was Yukos&#8217;s failure to disclose a number of related party transactions, will probably strengthen a new case against Mikhail Khodorkovsky, former Yukos chief executive, who has been jailed in a Siberian prison camp but now faces charges of embezzling more than $32bn in oil sales from Yukos.</p><p>The apparent show of support by prosecutors comes <strong>a week after Russia&#8217;s Higher Arbitration court overturned an earlier ruling that found PwC had itself underpaid Rbs243m ($9.6m) in taxes </strong>and sent the case back to a lower court.</p><p><strong>PwC on Wednesday said the audit firm&#8217;s apparent reversal of fortune had nothing to do with its withdrawal of the audits.

They filed a subpoena in the southern district court of New York in July seeking documents that might shed light on any role PwC&#8217;s headquarters in Manhattan played in the decision to withdraw the audits. PwC insists the decision was made by its Russia office alone. Its New York arm has declined to comment on the subpoena. </p><p>The defence lawyers argue that PwC may have violated US accounting rules. Also in July, they quietly filed a complaint with the California Board of Accountancy against Douglas Miller, one of the lead PwC partners on Yukos, who has since left Russia for California. It claims that Mr Miller, who played a main role in recommending that the audits should be withdrawn, did so fraudulently&#8230;<br><br>By March 2007, law enforcers were raiding the office, seizing documents and announcing a probe into whether PwC itself had evaded taxes. PwC partners were dragged in for questioning and in April, three state-linked companies said they were not renewing their audit contracts with PwC. </p><p>Throughout it all, Michael Kubena, then head of its Moscow office, had insisted the firm stood by its Yukos audits. But after six interrogations by prosecutors, Mr Miller told them he was recommending that the audits should be withdrawn. That was based on new information he said he had received from the prosecutors, which in his view showed that Yukos management, led by Mr Khodorkovsky, had lied to it on four significant transactions. </p><p>One day after PwC announced it was pulling the audits, Mr Kubena received a letter from Salavat Karimov, the senior prosecutor on the Yukos case. No criminal investigation would be launched into whether PwC employees had knowingly produced false audit opinions, he said &#8211; because it was clear they had been misled&#8230;</p><p>Whatever PwC may have known or not known about the transactions, many auditors believe there is no doubt that the broader embezzlement case against Mr Khodorkovsky and Mr Lebedev, the wily former Soviet official who co-founded Menatep, is political. But few have dared to testify at the trial. </p><p>Only one former PwC tax director, Stephen Wilson, who later took a full-time post at Yukos, took the witness stand to counter prosecutors&#8217; assertions that Mr Khodorkovsky had stolen Yukos&#8217;s oil. But he fled Russia after being presented with a summons by prosecutors to appear for questioning. In an environment such as that, defence lawyers say, it is little wonder PwC withdrew the audits. As one person close to the defence team puts it: &#8220;We don&#8217;t hold anything against them: they had a gun to their heads.&#8221;</p><p></p></blockquote><p>&#169;&nbsp;<em>Francine McKenna, The Digging Company LLC, 2022</em></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thedig.substack.com/subscribe?coupon=f5a9e295&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Get 25% off for 1 year&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://thedig.substack.com/subscribe?coupon=f5a9e295"><span>Get 25% off for 1 year</span></a></p><p></p><div id="youtube2-IjE4_h0t7qI" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;IjE4_h0t7qI&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IjE4_h0t7qI?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Run but you can't hide: There's no avoiding the impact of crypto on public companies]]></title><description><![CDATA[Investors must consider how cryptoasset price swings, and the "special" qualities of crypto, will affect results and taxes.]]></description><link>https://thedig.substack.com/p/run-but-you-cant-hide-theres-no-avoiding</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://thedig.substack.com/p/run-but-you-cant-hide-theres-no-avoiding</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Francine McKenna]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 22 Feb 2022 19:57:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/97b742ed-229a-4bbf-bad8-948362cf22d1_696x796.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve been reading here, and while I was at MarketWatch, you&#8217;ll know that I&#8217;m a skeptic regarding the legitimate utility and long-term viability of cryptoassets. </p><p>But this 500-pound black bear is eating everything!

MicroStrategy would then need to pledge additional bitcoin as collateral to secure that debt.

It&#8217;s important because the old Big 4 firms just ain&#8217;t what they used to be.</p><p>In my opinion, the largest global firms &#8212;&nbsp;Deloitte, EY, KPMG, and PwC&#8212; and the largest next tier firms such as Grant Thornton, BDO, and RSM, are less focused on performing their public duty of auditing and more interested in playing all sides of client opportunities to optimize their payday.</p><p>That includes employing slick language about &#8220;trust&#8221; to suggest their interest in <em>quote-unquote</em> &#8220;auditing&#8221; ESG disclosures, non-GAAP numbers, cybersecurity, or even stablecoin reserves is about enhancing statutory financial audits.&nbsp;</p><p>It is not.&nbsp; It's a play to sell more consulting services.</p><p>Audit firms claim they can <a href="https://retheauditors.com/2011/03/02/auditors-and-consulting-claims-of-no-conflict-strain-credibility/">wall off conflicts</a> when providing tax, consulting and other advisory services &#8212;&nbsp;whether to audit clients or non-audit clients. But they are pulling your leg. Instead, the consulting push repeatedly compromises the independence and integrity of their audits, destroys professional skepticism, and poisons the professionalism&nbsp;of their entire firms. &nbsp;</p><p>In a <a href="https://pcaobus.org/news-events/speeches/speech-detail/the-rise-of-advisory-services-in-audit-firms_544">speech</a> in 2014, PCAOB Board Member Steve Harris explained that as a result of SOx auditor independence rules, approximately 24% of the market on average [<em>in 2014</em>], is out of bounds for any given firm's consulting and advisory practices. Unbridled growth of consulting revenue inside what is supposed to be primarily an audit firm with a public duty can lead to audit firm instability.&nbsp;That&#8217;s what caused the split-up at Arthur Andersen even before Enron hit it like a ton of bricks. Harris said, &#8220;as the advisory practice grows, this prohibition may grow from a nuisance to a business obstacle.&#8221;</p><p>It's not much of an obstacle though because the SEC and PCAOB, in the US, and the FRC in the UK are playing whack-a-mole when they try at all to rein in the violations.</p><p>Contrary to popular misconceptions about the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the law does not forbid an audit firm from providing non-audit services to its U.S. listed audit clients.</p><p>Some potential services that create independence conflicts such as strategy consulting and what is now called &#8220;governance, risk &amp; compliance&#8221; were not even addressed in 2002. Strategy was thought to be the domain of McKinsey and Bain and Booz. But all the firms do strategy now. PwC bought Booz and renamed it Strategy&amp; in 2014, the same year of Steve Harris&#8217; speech. Seems he did not deter anyone.</p><p>For some services like tax, the law is quite vague, leaving plenty of room to rationalize. Therefore, audit firms rarely ask for permission, and instead typically ask for forgiveness when occasionally called out. &nbsp;In the U.S. lobbying efforts to relax auditor independence rules, especially for services provided to pre-IPO companies, were highly successful during the Trump-era SEC, leading to almost unlimited latitude to do everything even as an auditor.</p><p>GRC came into its own after the financial crisis, when there was a boom in non-prosecution and delayed prosecution agreements against the banks. The Big 4 stepped in to fill the need for <em>audit-like</em> services for compliance remediation and monitoring.</p><p>You would have been right most of the time if you guessed, during and immediately after the financial crisis, that if a Big 4 audit firm was not auditing a particular bank it was likely consulting to it. But in many cases auditors never stopped doing work for bank clients that went way beyond the work required to give an opinion on the financial statements. Banks spend more on non-audit services with their auditors than any other industry.</p><p>I am going to talk about three recent cases of accounting and securities fraud &#8212;&nbsp;<strong>Theranos, Autonomy-HP, and Carillion</strong> &#8212;&nbsp; because they involve at least three and even all four of the largest global audit firms providing several different services in addition to audit.</p><p>(Another example with global reach I don&#8217;t have time to get into, the <a href="https://thedig.substack.com/p/timing-is-everything-in-goldman-sachs?utm_source=url">Malaysian sovereign wealth fund case 1MDB</a>, also implicates all four Big 4 audit firms.&nbsp; If you want to learn more, the book <em><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/recommends/read/billion-dollar-whale-an-absurd-tale-of-financial-fraud">Billion Dollar Whale</a></em> has lots about the accounting and audit issues, which is unusual for business books these days.)</p><p><strong>Theranos</strong></p><p>When you're pre-IPO for 15 years and don't have an approved, commercial product, you're in the business of raising money from investors.</p><p>What is the auditors' duty in this case?</p><p>To protect investors, and the public markets from the company!</p><p>I wrote in March of 2018 that ultra-wealthy investors in private company Theranos had abandoned basic due diligence and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-investors-duped-by-the-theranos-fraud-never-asked-for-one-important-thing-2018-03-19">never requested audited financial statements before handing over hundreds of millions. </a>If the investors who gave Elizabeth Holmes money 2008 had asked for audited financial statements &#8212; and we confirmed during Holmes&#8217; recent trial that they had not &#8212;&nbsp; those investors would have been disappointed.&nbsp; There were <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-last-days-of-theranos-the-financials-were-as-overhyped-as-the-blood-tests-2018-10-16">reportedly</a>, none to be had except in its earliest years. EY did give opinions on Theranos&#8217; 2006, 2007 and 2008 financial statements. But then, for some reason, Holmes dumped EY and hired KPMG.</p><p><a href="https://thedig.substack.com/p/elizabeth-holmes-and-her-big-4-audit">And we also found out during Holmes&#8217; trial</a> that KPMG planned to audit Theranos&#8217; 2009 and 2010 financials and produce one report to cover the two years. However, KPMG disagreed with Holmes about the valuation of stock options and believed Theranos was understating its stock option compensation expense.&nbsp;So KPMG changed its mind about being an auditor and, instead, hung around until 2015 to help lend &#8220;credibility&#8221; to financial information that was provided to Theranos investors.</p><p>That makes two global audit firms hired to provide audit services to Theranos that gave no warning to investors or regulators of the lengths Holmes was going to grow Theranos and misrepresent its success to investors and the media.</p><p>Finally, a third firm, PwC, had no interest in providing audit services but was very interested in lucrative advisory work for the law firm defending Theranos against regulatory investigations from September 2016 to the spring of 2019. Theranos had no permanent CFO or external auditor but PwC was comfortable putting up to 40 PwC employees on site to spend more than 10,000 hours to collect text and email messages between Holmes and "Sunny" Balwani, the Theranos COO and Holmes's former boyfriend. PwC was also paid to wind down the company&#8217;s operations starting in late 2018.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>HP-Autonomy</strong></p><p>There was a really great article by the Economist&#8217;s Lane Green nearly 10 years ago called <em><a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21563726">Shape shifters</a>.</em></p><p>Green noted the phenomenal growth of Deloitte&#8217;s consulting and financial advisory business that year and wondered if Deloitte was &#8220;shape-shifting&#8221; into a firm with a business model that&#8217;s inconsistent with its government-sponsored mandates all over the world to do audits, mandates that create a virtual cash machine for auditors because they limit competition in exchange for focus and devotion to delivering public company audits that protect investors and markets.</p><p>Green asked Deloitte global CEO Barry Salzberg, &#8220;Do people perceive Deloitte as a consulting firm with an audit business rather than the other way round?&#8221;</p><p>Salzberg told Green: &#8220;We&#8217;re not going to take our eye off our professional responsibility with respect to either.&#8221;</p><p>Hardware firm HP announced it had acquired enterprise software firm Autonomy on October 3, 2011. HP had hired KPMG as a consultant to review Deloitte&#8217;s audits of Autonomy&#8217;s as part of its acquisition due diligence effort.</p><p>EY, HP&#8217;s external auditor, signed off on its audit opinion of HP&#8217;s full year results as of October 31, 2011 a couple of months later, on December 14.</p><p>But by early 2012 a whistleblower, a former Autonomy executive, had warned HP of the possibility it had overpaid for a fraud. HP began an investigation of the allegations in April 2012 and chose another Big 4 firm, PwC, as its independent forensic consultant to investigate the whistleblower&#8217;s claims.</p><p>HP had put PwC in a difficult spot. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bd138302-9ea6-11e0-9469-00144feabdc0#ixzz2CnDbPT5l">PwC Global Chairman Dennis Nally had told the Financial Times</a> just the year before, in June 2011, that he did not believe it was the auditors' job to find fraud. How could PwC say that Deloitte, or KPMG, should have caught the Autonomy fraud if that&#8217;s what it found?</p><p>If I took a poll of the average investor or public company executive and asked them which Big 4 firm audited the major banks or firms accused of securities fraud in recent years &#8212;&nbsp;GE, Colonial Bank, Tesla, Parmalat, Satyam, Lehman Brothers, JP Morgan &#8212; &nbsp;I doubt they could give me the name.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just a big blur for most when it comes to the auditor.</p><p>That&#8217;s why a reputational hit to one member of the oligopoly of global audit firms is a reputational hit to the whole lot of them. If PwC found professional malpractice by Deloitte or KPMG, all the largest audit firms would suffer the impact of a negative view of audit and auditors, in general, and suffer from the precedent of any fines, sanctions, or legal settlements against Deloitte or KPMG.&nbsp;</p><p>HP&#8217;s disclosure of the investigation and a multi-billion dollar material overstatement of goodwill and intangible assets came more than a year after its acquisition of Autonomy.</p><p>On November 20, 2012, HP said it was taking a non-cash impairment charge of $8.8 billion related to Autonomy in the fourth quarter of its 2012 fiscal year.</p><p>Should EY, HP&#8217;s auditor, have more closely scrutinized the values assigned to the assets and liabilities purchased from Autonomy that HP put on its 2011 books or on any of the 2012 quarterly statements? EY is&nbsp;<a href="http://pcaobus.org/standards/auditing/pages/au722.aspx">required to review HP&#8217;s quarterly financial statements</a>&nbsp;and provide a type of negative assurance that, based on their review, they are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the statements for them to be in conformity with GAAP.</p><p>In September 2020 the UK regulator, the FRC, ordered Deloitte UK to pay&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-accounting-watchdog-fines-deloitte-former-partners-over-autonomy-audits-11600351624?mod=article_inline">a record fine for its Autonomy audit of &#163;15 million</a>&nbsp;plus the investigation legal costs of &#163;5.6m.</p><p>The Deloitte Autonomy lead partner was banned from the accounting profession for five years and fined &#163;500,000. Another Deloitte partner was fined &#163;250,000 and &#8220;severely reprimanded&#8221;. They both had already &#8220;early retired&#8221; from the firm. Those fines are quite a bit larger than the ones the SEC imposed in 2019 on PwC &#8212; $8 million &#8212; and on its partner &#8212; $25 thousand&#8212;&nbsp; for auditor independence issues in 15 clients.</p><p>I reported at the time that Deloitte US and other Deloitte member firms played all possible angles with Autonomy &#8211; as its auditor in the UK and San Jose, CA, as a customer, as a vendor, and as an alliance partner for Autonomy software implementations. <a href="http://retheauditors.com/2012/11/21/mckenna-on-nprs-all-things-considered/">HP&#8217;s auditor Ernst &amp; Young</a>&nbsp;had also been a customer of Autonomy.</p><p>Sources had told me of at least two large client engagements where Autonomy and Deloitte Consulting worked together at the same time Deloitte UK was auditing the company. Deloitte was a &#8220;Platinum&#8221; strategic alliance technology implementation partner for HP, too.</p><p>Autonomy was a British company that listed on Nasdaq in 2000 but apparently followed the more lax British honor code, versus the Sarbanes-Oxley rules, when choosing which services besides the audit to buy from auditor Deloitte UK and Deloitte US.</p><p>The UK media didn&#8217;t miss a beat in reporting on Enron-style conflicts when the fraud allegations surfaced in 2012. Deloitte had been selling Autonomy nearly as much in consulting services such as tax compliance and due diligence for acquisitions &#8212; &#163;4.44 million in non-audit fees over the prior four years &#8212; as they were charging for the audits &#8212; &nbsp;&#163;5.422 million. The implication is that Deloitte&#8217;s independence may have been compromised.</p><p>EY continues to be HP&#8217;s auditor today. Why would&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/francinemckenna/2013/02/14/nothing-for-nothing-hp-pays-dearly-for-ernst-young-tax-testimony/?sh=3fafb6bc4b3c#comments">either firm</a>&nbsp;give up such a&nbsp;<a href="https://retheauditors.com/2013/02/18/tax-pays-hp-pays-ernst-young-two-million-to-testify/">mutually beneficial&nbsp;</a>relationship?</p><p>In September of 2012, EY&nbsp;went to&nbsp;Washington&nbsp;DC to explain how it helped its audit client HP develop and implement a strategy to move profits offshore to avoid U.S. taxes. That Congressional testimony was given smack in the middle of HP&#8217;s Autonomy investigation, while EY likely knew PwC would find a significant overstatement of the Autonomy acquisition goodwill and that the writedown would have to be announced in less than two months. The EY tax partner for audit client HP testified in defense of HP&#8217;s tax avoidance strategy and then charged HP $2 million dollars for the trip, according to&nbsp;<a href="http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/71/71087/proxy2013/HTML2/HP_NPS_2-1-13a/HP_NPS_2-1-13a.pdf">HP's 2013 proxy</a>.</p><p>Despite&nbsp;<a href="https://www.accountancyage.com/2012/11/20/pwc-finds-5bn-black-hole-in-hps-autonomy-deal/">numerous reports</a>&nbsp;of HP and whistleblowers reporting the findings of fraud and lack of action by auditors and advisors to the SEC, neither the SEC nor the PCAOB ever insisted on a restatement by HP and never charged Deloitte or individual partners at Deloitte US, EY, or KPMG with anything.</p><p><strong>Carillion</strong></p><p>Finally, we have UK company Carillion, a multinational&nbsp;construction&nbsp;and&nbsp;facilities management&nbsp;services company that in January 2018 became the was the largest ever liquidation in the UK. Carillion continues to be a painful portion of the KPMG UK&#8217;s &#8220;partner matters&#8221; litigation portfolio.</p><p>On February 3, 2022, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/94c89c70-f8fb-4867-a283-4a8a151060ad">Financial Times reported</a> that KPMG UK had been sued for &#163;1.3 billion by the liquidators. PwC UK was appointed by the UK High Court as <a href="https://www.pwc.co.uk/services/business-restructuring/administrations/carillion.html">Special Managers</a> for the Official Receiver of Carillion. &nbsp;</p><p>Deloitte and KPMG were ruled out of the liquidation role because they were already Carillion&#8217;s internal and external auditors, respectively. EY had advised Carillion on restructuring options before its collapse.</p><p>Responses to questions posed to the firms about their Carillion work from two parliamentary Committees revealed they collected nearly &#163;72m for work linked to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/carillion">Carillion</a>&nbsp;in the 10 years leading up to its&nbsp;collapse.</p><p>Expressions like &#8220;feasting on what was soon to become a carcass&#8221; were used by MPs to describe a picture of the Big 4 thriving while exploiting its vulnerabilities as Carillion began to rot.</p><p>However, PwC had conflicts at the time of its appointment in 2018, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fb913b2e-fac5-11e7-a492-2c9be7f3120a">according to the FT. </a>&nbsp;Carillion&#8217;s pension trustees had engaged PwC in 2017 to advise as financial difficulties increased. The contract was ongoing since PwC would be one of Carillion&#8217;s creditors that PwC, as an agent for the receiver, is supposed to treat impartially. &nbsp;The Insolvency Committee claims that PwC put up &#8220;ethical walls&#8221; to prevent conflicts between all of its activities for Carillion and its creditors.</p><p>The liquidators, with PwC&#8217;s help, are now suing KPMG UK saying the firm auditor missed &#8220;red flags&#8221; that Carillion&#8217;s accounts were misstated because it was apparently insolvent for more than two years before it collapsed. Carillion had liabilities of &#163;7 billion and just &#163;29 million in cash when it went into liquidation.</p><p>The FT quoted one MP saying he would not hire KPMG to audit &#8220;the contents of my fridge&#8221; and posited that it was KPMG&#8217;s Carillion failure that prompted the UK&#8217;s latest round of calls for substantial reforms to UK audit and corporate governance rules.&nbsp;</p><p>KPMG has been investigated by the UK FRC, which is comparable to an SEC/PCAOB combined in terms of its authority over the audit firms.&nbsp; KPMG has voluntarily&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/73e293cd-ce80-4294-967b-97f3a4882a38">ceased bidding for UK government contracts</a>&nbsp;after scandals.</p><p>Now the FRC says KPMG auditors misled regulators during inspections of their work on the Carillion audit and it threatens to &#8220;further damage the reputation of KPMG,&#8221; as if it could get any worse. Another scandal related to KPMG&#8217;s restructuring advisory activities for bedmaker Silentnight resulted in a&nbsp; &#163;13 million fine in August 2021. KPMG has since sold the restructuring unit.</p><p>One good thing is KPMG&#8217;s UK chief executive Jon Holt <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fb22432a-ebd1-45ea-8966-0bac7953efd3">acknowledged</a> that it was &#8220;clear&#8201;.&#8201;.&#8201;.&#8201;misconduct has occurred [by KPMG regarding the Carillion inspections] and that our regulator was misled&#8221;.</p><p>However, Holt and his Big 4 UK colleagues are crying in their tea towels about their damaged reputations all the way to the bank.</p><p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e1654a46-169c-47a6-a27f-955a9b2638f9">KPMG&#8217;s UK partners took home</a> an average of $934k last year in a booming deals market. It was the biggest payday for KPMG partners since 2014. And it is even better at the other UK Big 4 firms Deloitte partners received an average of $1.2 million last year plus an extra $267k from the sale of its restructuring division.

These &#8220;lossmaking transactions were not commercially justified on any basis&#8221;, the judge said of the hardware reselling programme. They were concealed because their revelation would have revealed that Autonomy&#8217;s software business was not generating the accelerating profits &#8220;which heavily influenced its price&#8221;.</p><p>He found that HPE relied on what was said about Autonomy&#8217;s revenue in the accounting material and was induced to pay $11bn for Autonomy.</p></blockquote><p>In November 2018 <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/former-autonomy-ceo-charged-wire-fraud">U.S. prosecutors criminally charged</a> Lynch and former Autonomy vice president of finance Stephen Chamberlain over the HPE acquisition.

20, 2018:</strong></p><blockquote><p>It is important to note that <em>the inexcusable actions of the individuals who were separated from KPMG over a year ago were <strong>designed to subvert the PCAOB&#8217;s inspection process,</strong> </em>and had no effect whatsoever on any of the firm&#8217;s audit opinions or clients&#8217; financial statements. Our commitment to audit quality and integrity remains unwavering. In addition, we have taken steps to reinforce our values and culture, and to enhance our governance.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>We did not know the names of those KPMG fired or the KPMG audit clients potentially impacted when, on <strong>April 11, 2017</strong>, KPMG announced that &#8220;it had determined that six individuals in its Audit practice, including the head of the Audit Practice, four other partners and one employee, had violated the firm&#8217;s Code of Conduct and they are leaving the firm&#8221;.  The names of the accused were not revealed until the SEC filed civil charges and the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/5-former-kpmg-executives-and-pcaob-employees-charged-manhattan-federal-court-fraudulent">Department of Justice unsealed criminal charges</a> on <strong>January 22, 2018</strong>  against five former KPMG executives and PCAOB employees. Those individuals were accused of stealing &#8220;valuable and confidential&#8221; PCAOB information and using that information to &#8220;fraudulently improve&#8221; KPMG&#8217;s PCAOB inspection results. Brian Sweet was the sixth defendant &#8212;&nbsp;a former KPMG partner and former PCAOB associate director &#8212; who pled guilty immediately and agreed to cooperate against the others.</p><p>The Justice Department maintained anonymity for the KPMG clients impacted by the scandal until the trial of two of the defendants in February-March 2019. The SEC and PCAOB have never commented publicly on any specific KPMG clients impacted by the scandal and the SEC specifically asked me back in June 2018 not to disclose the client names.</p><p>Steven Sugarman&#8217;s anti-SLAPP suits and the report of a DOJ investigation into short interest in Banc of California prompted me to go back and look at the history between Banc and its former auditor, KPMG.</p><p></p>

SEC will (potentially) impose an initial trading prohibition on a registrant as soon as practicable after.</em></p></blockquote><p></p><p>The <a href="https://pcaobus.org/oversight/international/board-determinations-holding-foreign-companies-accountable-act-hfcaa">PCAOB recently issued Rule 6100</a>, a guideline for how it will operate to handle audit firms it is unable to inspect.&nbsp;The PCAOB established this rule as a result of the HFCA, which mandated a response from the PCAOB and SEC regarding how they will evaluate the level of resistance from an audit firm and its client before moving towards delisting. &nbsp;</p><p>In short, the PCAOB&nbsp;will tell the SEC when it is not able to inspect an audit performed by a firm that resists.&nbsp;The PCAOB will provide the SEC a list of the public companies audited by that firm. The SEC will review that list and send an inquiry to the companies to ask that they either verify compliance will occur or change auditors. If the company does not comply or respond to the SEC inquiry that they will change audit firms they face removal from U.S. based stock exchanges. The law went into effect December 18, 2020.</p><p>It is too soon to tell what it will take for the PCAOB to formally refer an audit firm and its clients to the SEC.  </p><p>There&#8217;s nothing new about delisting companies or de-registration of audit firms. Delisting is part of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and successive updates. Registration/de-registration is a core activity of the PCAOB since its founding in 2002, based on the Sarbanes-Oxley law.</p><p>We finally got rid of Chinese fraud Luckin.

The injuries can be more than financial. &nbsp;</p><p>The SEC&#8217;s chief enforcer Gurbir Grewal has been asking auditors to step up in almost every speech he&#8217;s made since joining the SEC six months ago<a href="https://thedig.substack.com/p/heres-a-target-list-for-if-sec-enforcement">. In early December</a> Grewal asked an audience of audit professionals, CFOs, and other regulators, &#8220;Where are the people who are supposed to be counseling folks to play within the guardrails not at the edges of the rules or outside the lines?&#8221;</p><p>The SEC&#8217;s Grewal can now ask, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t any of the global accounting firms who worked for Theranos do their public duty?&#8221;</p><p>During Elizabeth Holmes&#8217; four-month trial we learned that at least three Big 4 public accounting firms had provided services to Theranos, including audits, during its 15-year life as a company.</p><p>On Monday a jury in California found Theranos founder and former CEO Elizabeth Holmes guilty of four charges she cheated her investors. She was either acquitted or the jury could not decide on seven other charges, including that she had misled patients about the readiness and accuracy of her faulty device to test blood with just a drop.</p><p>In 2018 I wrote that the ultra-wealthy Theranos investors had abandoned basic due diligence and <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-investors-duped-by-the-theranos-fraud-never-asked-for-one-important-thing-2018-03-19">never requested audited financial statements before handing over hundreds of millions.</a> Those investors would have been disappointed if they had asked because, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-last-days-of-theranos-the-financials-were-as-overhyped-as-the-blood-tests-2018-10-16">reportedly</a>, there were none to be had.</p><p>Philippe Poux took over as Chief Financial Officer of Theranos in mid-2017 as the company was deluged with investigations and lawsuits. His goal was to get a better picture of the company&#8217;s cash position and funding needs. With the exception of the first few years after Holmes founded the company in 2003 at age 19, Theranos hadn&#8217;t had a CFO or an auditor.&nbsp;</p><p>Elizabeth Holmes was forced out of her own company after settling securities fraud charges with the SEC in March of 2018. But it was an audit that finally forced Theranos to shut down.</p><p>Fortress Investment Group LLC, a division of SoftBank demanded an independent auditor&#8217;s opinion on Theranos&#8217; 2017 financial statements as a condition of loaning the company $100 million in December 2017, $65 million immediately and&nbsp;the rest if it got a clean audit and met other conditions. </p><p>Theranos brought in a boutique audit firm that specialized in biotech. OUM &amp; Co. LLP did its public duty by quickly concluding that Theranos would not have enough cash to commercialize its blood testing device with all regulatory approvals, even if it received the remaining $35 million in funding from Fortress by the summer of 2018.</p><p>Theranos&#8217; last CEO David Taylor told me in 2018, &#8220;We were late with the product, and we ran out of time.&#8221;</p><p>On September 8, the first day of Holmes&#8217; trial, former Theranos Corporate Controller Danise Yam, a former Deloitte San Jose and Hong Kong audit professional, testified that there were two Big 4 firms in an auditor role that had the chance early on to rein in Holmes&#8217; &#8220;fake it until you make it&#8221; approach.</p><p>Holmes testified that Lucas Venture Group founder Don Lucas, one of her earliest investors, was the one who insisted she get an outside audit. Lucas also hired a law firm to review the company&#8217;s patents and asked for copies of the company&#8217;s contracts.</p><p>Yam testified that Ernst &amp; Young was the company&#8217;s auditor in 2006 when she was hired. EY gave an opinion on Theranos&#8217; financial statements for 2006, 2007 and 2008, according to Yam. Yam reported directly to Elizabeth Holmes between 2006 and 2017. She left Theranos in March 2017, when the company turned over accounting and finance to turnaround firm Alvarez &amp; Marsal and hired Poux as CFO.</p><p>Ernst &amp; Young did not reply to a request for comment to confirm its services to Theranos.</p><p>Poux had told me in 2018 that KPMG came in to do an audit in 2009, but the process was never completed, and there was no report. Yam confirmed in her testimony that Theranos hired KPMG as its auditor in 2009, replacing EY, but that it never issued any audit opinions.</p><p>Now we know why.</p><p>According to Yam&#8217;s testimony, KPMG had decided to audit the financial information for 2009 and 2010 at the same time and produce a report covering the two years together. However, KPMG disagreed with the company about the valuation of stock options granted to Holmes and several other employees in May 2010. KPMG, Yam testified, believed the valuation of the option grant should reflect the higher value that new financing had created for the company. The issue was never resolved and KPMG never issued an opinion on either the 2009 or 2010 financial statements.</p><p>However, KPMG hung around at Theranos, Yam testified. She said she continued to work with KPMG until 2015. Was that unusual, the prosecutor asked Yam. Yes, Yam testified, because a private company usually has a financial statement audit annually to lend &#8220;credibility&#8221; to financial information it gives existing and potential investors.</p><p>What was KPMG doing? Yam, testified that her responsibilities included everything a day-to-day Controller does. From Yam&#8217;s testimony:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> Did your duties include preparing financial statements?</p><p><strong>Yam:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> Did your duties include ensuring that transactions were appropriately entered into the financial system?</p><p><strong>Yam:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> What financial system did Theranos use during your tenure as Corporate Controller?</p><p><strong>Yam:</strong> QAD [fm note: QAD is a full-featured <a href="https://www.qad.com/manufacturing-erp">manufacturing ERP software</a> and supply chain solution that someone helped implement and set up.] </p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> Did you regularly provide Ms. Holmes with documents?</p><p><strong>Yam:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> Did you regularly provide Ms. Holmes with documents summarizing the company&#8217;s financial condition?</p><p><strong>Yam:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> Did you regularly provide Ms. Holmes with documents summarizing the company&#8217;s cash position?</p><p><strong>Yam:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> Was it part of your job to make sure that Ms. Holmes was aware of the financial state of the company?</p><p><strong>Yam:</strong> Yes.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Yam also testified she:</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;&#8230;did work around the equity. If the company grants options to employees, consulting directors, I would keep track of the number of options that we granted and the value we granted it at and the date&#8230; I also keep track of the capitalization summary of the company. When shareholders invest [I kept track of] which series of the preferred stock.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>KPMG came in to replace EY as the company&#8217;s auditor in 2009 and decided sometime in late 2010 or early 2011, to step down as auditor but to instead stick around and provide consulting to the company. Things got a bit dicey, Yam testified, when cash became tight in early 2009 while KPMG was still the auditor of record.</p><p>From Yam&#8217;s testimony:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> As the Corporate Controller were you familiar with the company&#8217;s cash position in early 2009?</p><p><strong>Yam:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> How would you describe the company's cash position in early 2009?</p><p><strong>Yam:</strong> The company had problems, or issues, with paying vendor at that time.</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> When you say "the company had problems or issues paying vendors at that point in time," what do you mean?</p><p><strong>Yam:</strong> So during that, during that period, so we would -- during our normal course of business we buy, we buy supplies, we buy equipment, we buy, you know -- or we have to pay rent and something like that, and we usually have credit terms like the vendor would give us 30 days or 60 days to pay the bill.</p><p>But when that bill comes due sometimes during this first half of 2009, and sometimes I -- we just do not have the cash to pay all of them on time, so I would have to pick and choose which one we want to pay first.</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> So you were picking and choosing which vendors Theranos would pay in this early 2009 time period?</p><p><strong>Yam:</strong> Correct.</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> Did you have discussions with Ms. Holmes about the company's cash position in early 2009?</p><p><strong>Yam:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> At a high level, what was the substance of those discussions?</p><p><strong>Yam:</strong> I let her know that we would not be able to pay all of the vendors and in one instance that I also told her that we wouldn't, you know -- I also suggest to her that we may have to withhold her payroll so that we could pay a few more vendor with the money. There's also a situation that we have to contact the banker to clear a check so that we can make the next payroll.</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> When you say "we had to contact a banker to make sure that we would make the next payroll," what do you mean? Tell us what happened.</p><p><strong>Yam:</strong> &nbsp;So, for that time, I already submitted the payroll record, and so the next day we need to have money in the bank account for that -- for the payroll company to draw the fund to pay our employees. And then we find out that the bank did not clear the check because they have to hold the check for a certain period of time when we don't have our money in the bank account to support that.</p><p>And so I brought that up to Elizabeth Holmes, and we were in a conference room together, and we called the banker and tried to convince him to let that go one time without a waiting period, and he refused to do that. So I have to contact the -- our customer who cut the check to us, and I have to contact the customer and have her contact the banker to prove that they -- the actual -- the check will be cleared as a legitimate check.</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> &nbsp;Was Ms. Holmes aware that you were doing that?</p><p><strong>Yam:</strong> Yes, we were in the conference room together.</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> Okay. and was all of this as part of an effort to make sure that Theranos could pay its employees and meet its payroll?</p><p><strong>Yam:</strong> Yes.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Yam testified the cash crunch was resolved, for the time being, when Theranos got a loan from Fidelity, the investment bank.&nbsp;The loan was guaranteed by COO Sunny Balwani, who was at that time in a relationship with Holmes.</p><p>In 2010, Theranos raised more money from investors, $45 million, Yam testified. Yam testifies that in 2012 she gave KPMG some 2010 and 2011 financial information.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> Up in the left-hand corner it says Theranos Inc. YE 12/31/2011 trial balance.</p><p><strong>Yam:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> And what does YE stand for?</p><p><strong>Yam:</strong> Year end.</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> And trial balance, what is that?</p><p><strong>Yam:</strong> It's the company financial balance of each account that is including all of the financial accounts including the assets and liability and income and expenses and equity.</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> And was the trial balance something that you maintained in the ordinary course of your business?</p><p><strong>Yam:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> Were you intending by this excel spreadsheet to provide accurate information to KPMG about Theranos' income statement for 2009, 2010, and 2011?</p><p><strong>Yam:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> What was Theranos' revenue for 2009?</p><p><strong>Yam:</strong> It was $2,793,846.</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> And was Theranos' revenue for 2010 $1,401,305?</p><p><strong>Yam:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> And was Theranos' revenue for 2011 $518,248?</p><p><strong>Yam:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> And if we scroll down in the column b for the income statement there's a line for net loss.</p><p><strong>Yam:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Prosecutor:</strong> And what is the net loss?</p><p><strong>Yam:</strong> That's the revenue after subtracting for all of the expenses, and that's what the company basically was losing for that year.</p></blockquote><p>Those revenue numbers seem to be going in the wrong direction. Which contracts were providing revenue to the company way back in 2009-2011?</p><p>Based on Yam&#8217;s testimony, it appears that KPMG would know the answer because the firm was working with Yam &#8212;&nbsp;who reported directly to Holmes during the majority of this time &#8212; doing the work of accounting and finance rather than auditing it. Yam, with KPMG&#8217;s help, was preparing financial statements, paying employees and vendors, and keeping track of option grants and investors&#8217; stakes in Theranos.</p><p>Was KPMG also helping Holmes and Balwani create the presentations and other information sent to investors? Did that revenue and contract information, as well as cash position and net loss information, match what KPMG saw coming out of the company&#8217;s general ledger software while working with Yam? We don&#8217;t know because KPMG has never said.</p><p>KPMG did not reply to repeated requests for comment on the services it was providing to Theranos between 2009 and 2015 instead of an audit.&nbsp;</p><p>Global audit firm PwC had no interest in providing audit services either, but stayed busy with lucrative advisory work when things were already going badly for Holmes and Theranos, from September 2016 to the spring of 2019. PwC&#8217;s Justin Offen testified he worked for the company&#8217;s law firm, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, to help Theranos respond to SEC and U.S. Justice Department investigations, all the while Theranos had no permanent CFO or an external auditor.</p><p>PwC spent more than 10,000 hours collecting text and email messages Holmes exchanged with Ramesh "Sunny" Balwani, the Theranos COO and Holmes's former boyfriend. Sometimes as many as 40 PwC employees were on site. PwC also helped wind down the company&#8217;s operations beginning in late 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A PwC spokeswoman declined comment on its Theranos activities.&nbsp;</p><p>A spokesman from Deloitte did not respond to a request to comment on whether that firm ever provided services to Theranos, its executives or board, its investors, or related third-parties.</p><p>Many Theranos investments came from family offices and via referrals from early investors. Early investor Don Lucas became Theranos Chairman of the Board and introduced Holmes to Oracle founder&nbsp;Larry Ellison, who invested through his family office. Chris Lucas, Don Lucas&#8217; nephew, also invested millions. He was called as a witness by the prosecution and admitted he piggybacked on his uncle&#8217;s due diligence efforts and didn&#8217;t do much of his own.</p><p>Henry Kissinger&#8217;s lawyer Daniel Mosley of Cravath Swain &amp; Moore LLP, invested $6 million on behalf of Mosely Family Holdings. He introduced Holmes to several other clients who became investors including the Walton family, the DeVos family, and the Cox family. In total they kicked in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/elizabeth-holmes-trial-theranos/card/1qxHNRhKgViGm1EBAqel">$384 million</a>, over half of a $730 million funding round.</p><p>Elizabeth Holmes is going to prison because of crimes against investors not against the patients of her faulty device. She was found guilty on four charges related to wire fraud against investors &#8212; PFM Healthcare Master Fund, Lakeshore Capital Management LP and Mosley Family Holdings LLC.</p><p>Brian Grossman oversaw PFM&#8217;s investment. The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e04cb9f0-3726-490b-bbcd-2a6f522a42a2">Financial Times</a> wrote yesterday that he &#8220;testified that his firm had performed extensive due diligence on Theranos and come away impressed by the company&#8217;s purported work with the military and ability to run a full range of blood tests.&#8221; <br><br><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-investors-duped-by-the-theranos-fraud-never-asked-for-one-important-thing-2018-03-19">I wrote about PFM&#8217;s lawsuit against Theranos in 2018</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The Partner Fund sued Theranos, Holmes and Balwani in 2016 after investing more than $96 million in 2014. The hedge fund accused Theranos of securities fraud, alleging that Holmes and Balwani had raised the funds &#8220;[t]hrough a series of lies, material misstatements and omissions.&#8221; These investors settled their lawsuit in 2017 for an undisclosed amount that was reportedly approximately half of their investment.</p></blockquote><p>When I reported on Theranos in 2018 and talked to Grossman&#8217;s lawyer about the lawsuit, I specifically asked if PFM had asked for audited financial statements before investing. Since there were none when PFM invested, the firm obviously invested without seeing any audited financials. The attorney gave me this bland quote in 2018:</p><blockquote><p>The SEC&#8217;s allegations are serious and are thankfully bringing more attention to what can fairly be described as atrocious misconduct.</p></blockquote><p>It&#8217;s highly unusual to see a criminal case against a private company, but if it sells securities, or in this case raises money from accredited investors, the law does have remedies.</p><p>So why didn&#8217;t the jury hold Holmes accountable for the harm done to patients?</p><p>Marc Fagel, the former director of the SEC's&nbsp;San Francisco office, told me that the harm to patients likely drove the criminal prosecution of Holmes, even if the jury did not ultimately assign guilt for misleading the patients. </p><blockquote><p>The defense was able to cast doubt on whether Holmes had scienter, or intent, to mislead patients. </p></blockquote><p>Some question why anyone should worry about ultra-wealthy, so-called &#8220;accredited&#8221; investors, who didn&#8217;t insist on audited financial statements or do more due diligence. Prosecutor John Bostic told the jury in his rebuttal to the defense&#8217;s closing argument:</p><blockquote><p>The level of due diligence doesn&#8217;t matter. A scheme to defraud is still a scheme to defraud even if it would only ensnare someone who is less careful than they should be.</p></blockquote><p>It&#8217;s not the investors&#8217; faults no one was there to protect them from themselves. Two audit firms, EY and KPMG, were there to do audits and didn&#8217;t raise their hands to signal to the public or the regulators that something might be amiss. One more, PwC, preferred to collect millions to help the company and its executives stay out of trouble while Theranos continued to use faulty medical devices with real patients.</p><p>SEC Director of Enforcement Gurbir Grewal told that Washington D.C. audience in December:</p><blockquote><p>Independent auditors are supposed to be the first lines of defense against corporate misconduct.

Jesse M. Furman<br>United States District Judge<br>Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse<br>40 Foley Square<br>New York, NY 10007</p><p><em>By email and registered mail</em></p><p>December 21, 2021</p><p>Case 1:14-cv-02811-JMF</p><p>In re <em>City of Providence, Rhode Island v. BATS Global Markets, Inc.</em></p><p>Your Honor:</p><p>I have been closely following and reporting on the issues which are the subject of this case for the last seven years.<a href="#_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> There are key documents/exhibits that remain sealed in the current case docket. These exhibits are important for the public and the press to be able to follow the arguments of the case and its status, and for me to continue ongoing reporting on this case and its eventual aftermath.</p><p>On November 23, Defendants wrote (ECF No. 784) in response to Plaintiffs&#8217; Motion to Unseal certain documents, filed November 19, 2021 (ECF Nos. 776, 777, and 779, the &#8220;Motion&#8221;) that &#8220;Plaintiffs&#8217; discussion of &#8216;press interest&#8217; is a red herring. There has been no recent press interest in this case.&#8221;</p><p>That statement is untrue. It is not unusual when a case takes a stop-and-start and winding road to trial, or eventual settlement, the press temporarily has to move on. The Plaintiffs faced a dismissal in 2015 when much of the reporting occurred and then appealed and prevailed, essentially reviving the case in December 2017.</p><p>It&#8217;s especially challenging for the press to keep following a case, and make the case to their editors to keep writing about it, when key documents in the case &#8212;&nbsp;documents and exhibits that are important for understanding plaintiffs&#8217; and defendants&#8217; arguments and objections &#8212;&nbsp;are sealed, put out of the reach of the press.</p><p>I last wrote about the case in May 2018, after the Second Circuit denied the defendants&#8217; petition for a panel rehearing on March 13, 2018 and the defendants filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the United State Supreme Court. After the Second Circuit denied the defendants petition for a panel rehearing on March 13, 2018, defendants filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the United State Supreme Court. That petition was denied by the Court on October 9, 2018. Following remand, defendants filed a new motion to dismiss, which the Southern District of New York denied on May 28, 2019, reasoning that Plaintiffs had successfully alleged standing, reliance, scienter, and loss causation.&nbsp;</p><p>And, so, here we are today. This journalist is not shy. I am petitioning to make all documents available to the public, on behalf of all of the journalists who were writing about this case. There is real media interest in this case relating to documents currently filed under seal and the briefing <em>sub judice.</em></p><p>The Court now knows about this press interest and coverage of the case. I am writing to ask you to remove the temporary <em>Confidential Treatment </em>for documents/exhibits that provide ongoing details and discussions regarding:</p><p>1) Motion for Summary Judgment on grounds of preclusion by the defendants, originally filed as ECF No. 600, and</p><p>2) Motion for Summary Judgment&nbsp;on Grounds of Lack of Article III Standing by defendants, originally filed as ECF No. 613.</p><p>Records may be sealed for a temporary purpose, but courts should follow procedures that ensure records become unsealed when they can be.<a href="#_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> The Court has repeatedly indicated each time a seal has been requested that it is only &#8220;granted temporarily.&#8221; See, e.g., ECF Nos. 598, 620, 636-637, 741-744 (&#8220;The Court will assess whether to keep the materials at issue sealed or redacted when deciding the underlying motion&#8221;).</p><p>Specifically, ECF Nos. 609; 611; 611-1 to 611-27; 638; 660; 660-1 to 660-209; 669; 671; 671-1 to 671-279; 724; 726; 730-1; 730-2; 730-15; 731; 731-1 to 731-2; 740; 740-1 to 740-5 remain under seal despite the fact that the initial documents in each series of motions and responses, 600 and 613, were available for public view.</p><p>The public in general and news media in particular have a qualified right of access to court proceedings and records. This right is rooted in the common law.<a href="#_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> The First Amendment also confers on the public a qualified right of access. Some courts of appeals have held that the public&#8217;s First Amendment right of access to court proceedings includes both criminal and civil cases.<a href="#_ftn4" title="">[4]</a></p><p>I am an independent journalist who publishes original analysis of the most widely-held and widely-shorted public companies in the world in a newsletter called <em>The Dig</em>. I&#8217;ve been an investigative reporter and feature writer for publications including&nbsp;<em>Dow Jones</em> <em>MarketWatch</em>, <em>Forbes, American Banker, Financial Times, and the Chicago Booth Review since 2006</em>. At <em>MarketWatch</em> I was a full-time reporter who monitored and reported on public company accounting, fraud and financial investigations, and the often questionable financial reporting practices of pre-IPO companies until November 2019 when I began publishing <em>The Dig</em>.</p><p>Before that I spent more than 20 years in public accounting and consulting, including for KPMG/BearingPoint in the U.S. and Latin America, and at PwC. I am also an adjunct professor of international business in the MBA program at American University&#8217;s Kogod School of Business and an adjunct professor in the graduate accounting program at Ohio State University.</p><p>Members of the news media and the public must be afforded an opportunity to be heard on motions to seal. Courts routinely permit non-parties to intervene for the purposes of challenging motions to seal.<a href="#_ftn5" title="">[5]</a></p><p>Given that court files are now available for inspection on the Internet, federal rules of practice and procedure provide that certain identifiers be redacted in court filings. It has not been fully documented for the public record that any information in these documents has been unequivocally established to be confidential information worthy of exception to the public access default such as trade secrets; sensitive proprietary information; sensitive financial, business, or personnel information; sensitive personal information such as medical records; and personally identifying information such as social security numbers, financial account numbers, and the names of minor children.</p><p>The court, of course, has the obligation and the discretion to weigh the need for secrecy against the public&#8217;s right of access but there should be a public record of what is sealed and why, consistent with the reason for sealing.<a href="#_ftn6" title="">[6]</a> Sealing should be no more extensive than necessary. Courts should seal only the portions of the record that require sealing.<a href="#_ftn7" title="">[7]</a></p><p>An entire case file should not be sealed to protect the secrecy of some documents.

I wrote about a case that would give the SEC a two-for-one, &#8220;one that if followed-up on may throttle a SPAC deal in the stablecoin space.&#8221;</p><p>In particular, Grewal and Jacques singled out gatekeepers &#8212;&nbsp;specifically auditors&#8212; for what he said were obvious, recurring lapses.</p><blockquote><p>We need to make sure that gatekeepers are doing their jobs, that gatekeepers are discharging their duties with good faith [that] they're holding their corporate clients to task, making sure that they play by the rules. You are uniquely positioned in this room to help build back that trust, to help build back that trust in the financial reporting domain. Your front row responsibilities for reporting and disclosures are critically important. </p><p>And as gatekeepers, I think, you know, you're going to play a critical role moving forward &#8230;I was talking and joking back in the holding room, I said Matt, these fact patterns, they're just so basic. This still happens&#8230;You know, this is not new conduct.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Today I&#8217;m going to give Grewal and Jacques a few ideas about cases that the SEC may or may not still be looking at, after enforcement actions that I think fell short of holding everyone accountable. There are also a few cases not yet brought that should be. It&#8217;s not clear whether the SEC is looking at them at all.</p><p></p>

Gensler explained how the SPAC process works:</p><blockquote><p>[SPACs are] blank-check companies [that] raise cash from the public through initial public offerings (IPOs). I call this step the &#8220;SPAC blank-check IPO.&#8221; The number of SPAC blank-check IPOs has ballooned by nearly 10 times between 2019 and 2021. Further, those SPAC blank-check IPOs <a href="https://spacanalytics.com/">now account for more than three-fifths of all U.S. IPOs</a>.</p><p>Typically, the blank-check company has up to two years to search for and merge with a target company.

Brandeis</em></p><p>JPMorgan Chase filed a <a href="https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rJWmH.OutlYM/v0">federal lawsuit </a>for breach of contract against its client Tesla on November 15, seeking to recover over $162 million dollars JPM says is &#8220;immediately due and payable by Tesla&#8221; for a deal the two companies entered into back in 2014. </p><p>The lawsuit recounts the transactions Tesla entered into with several banks including JPM, which required Tesla to deliver either shares of its stock or cash to JPMorgan if, at the time the warrants expired, Tesla&#8217;s share price was above the contractual &#8220;strike price.&#8221; The warrants expired in June and July 2021, when Tesla&#8217;s stock price was well above both the original and adjusted strike prices. JPM demanded the shares or cash due, but Tesla has ignored what JPM says is a clear contractual obligation to pay the bank in full.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-11-16/jpmorgan-fights-tesla-over-warrants">Bloomberg&#8217;s Matt Levine broke down the rationale</a> for the complex transaction and its technical aspects in excruciating but lucid detail the next day. It&#8217;s one of those &#8216;heads I win, tails you lose&#8217; type of deals investment banks talk seemingly sophisticated company treasurers into.</p><blockquote><p>Tesla had <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000119312514077288/d678614d424b5.htm">sold $1.38 billion of 7-year convertible bonds</a>&nbsp;with a 1.25% coupon and a conversion price of $359.87, a 42.5% premium above its stock price of $252.54 at the time of the sale in 2014.&nbsp; Tesla&#8217;s $1.38 billion 7-year convertible would convert into about 3.8&nbsp;million shares of stock, so Tesla bought a 7-year option on 3.8&nbsp;million shares with a strike price of $359.87.</p><p>Then Tesla sold several banks, including JPM and Goldman Sachs, a separate option (the &#8220;warrant&#8221;) at a higher strike price. &#8230; &#8220;a 7ish-year warrant with a strike price of $560.6388, a 122% premium above the stock price when it issued the convertible bonds.&nbsp; The overall result is that the company has effectively issued a synthetic high-premium convertible: If the stock goes up 80% or 100%, it will issue some shares on the convertible but get them back from the bond hedge; it only &#8220;really&#8221; issues shares if the stock goes up more than 122% and the warrant is in the money.</p><p>In effect they buy an option from the banks (the bond hedge) that mirrors the conversion option in the convertible&#8230;</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Convertible bonds almost always dilute the ownership percentage of current shareholders, resulting in those shareholders owning a smaller piece of the company after bondholders exercise conversion rights. Even though a 42.5% conversion premium seems high, Levine says it is likely not high enough to make the dilution of the shares worth it for existing shareholders like senior executives. But, if you set the conversion premium on the bonds at 100% few would buy them.</p><p>JPM says in a footnote to its lawsuit:</p><blockquote><p>Concurrently with the sale of the 2021 Warrants, Tesla also issued certain convertible notes and purchased call options (known as a bond hedge) from JPMorgan. The bond hedge and warrant transactions, collectively, benefitted Tesla by mitigating the stock dilution resulting from Tesla&#8217;s issuance of the convertible notes and were structured to allow Tesla to make certain federal income tax deductions.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Each of the 2021 Warrants was a call option for Tesla&#8217;s common stock, the lawsuit says. In exchange for a premium paid up front by JPMorgan to Tesla, Tesla gave JPMorgan the right to purchase, on the warrant&#8217;s designated expiration date, one share of Tesla common stock per underlying 2021 Warrant at a specified &#8216;strike price&#8217;. </p><p>Tesla sold the warrants to JPM and purchased over-the-counter call options under an International Swaps and Derivatives Association form agreement, according to Levine. There are many more complex aspects to this deal and I highly recommend Levine&#8217;s column on the subject.&nbsp;As is common with many complex equity transactions, it is standard for the deal to have an adjustment provision in case of a corporate event such as a bankruptcy or an acquisition that gives the bank broad discretion to adjust the terms of the deal to maintain its value to the bank.&nbsp;</p><p>Here&#8217;s how Tesla said in its last 10-K that it accounted for the transactions:</p><blockquote><p>As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders&#8217; equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet. </p></blockquote><p></p><p>What I&#8217;m interested in is the fact that something happened that gave JPM, and the other banks, the right to adjust the value of the option on the bank&#8217;s books but it appears that Tesla did not make the same adjustment for the deal on its books. When the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions expired, JPM told Tesla it owed more money because of JPM&#8217;s adjustments. But Tesla disagreed and did not pay JPM the extra money the bank said it owed. </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thedig.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://thedig.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p></p>

The KPMG-PCAOB regulatory data theft scandal represents an unprecedented legal and ethical breakdown at one of the largest global audit firms, and an internal controls and compliance breakdown at the PCAOB, its regulator.</p><p>Ethical and professional norms at both organizations collapsed. PCAOB professionals acted criminally and corruptly in cooperation with the leadership of KPMG&#8217;s audit practice and <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/kpmg-indictment-suggests-many-who-werent-charged-knew-regulator-data-was-stolen-2018-01-23">multiple professionals</a> at the firm.</p><p>On April 11, 2017,&nbsp;KPMG had announced in a press release that its internal investigation had determined that six individuals in its audit practice, including the leader of the audit practice Scott Marcello, four other partners, and one employee, had violated the firm&#8217;s Code of Conduct by taking advantage of inappropriate advance access to regulatory inspection data. No one from the SEC or PCAOB made any public comment at the time of &nbsp;KPMG&#8217;s announcement.</p><p>In mid-December 2017, in between the KPMG announcement and the DOJ/SEC announcement, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/clayton-2017-12-12">Jay Clayton fired the PCAOB board</a> and installed a political ally, William Duhnke, as Chairman.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-05/scandal-filled-financial-watchdog-pcaob-is-getting-attention-in-washington">His tenure was a disaster </a>in many ways, but we did not know then that the dramatic move was, at least in part, a response to a massive criminal conspiracy the board had presided over. </p><p>A month later, on January 23, 2018, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York indicted four KPMG partners, one KPMG Director, and one PCAOB professional, charging them with conspiracy and wire fraud in connection with the scheme. The SEC also brought civil enforcement charges against all defendants on the same day. All defendants were arrested and then released on bail. Scott Marcello and one other KPMG official were not charged but were identified by prosecutors during the trial as unindicted co-conspirators. One KPMG partner and the one PCAOB official stood trial and were found guilty, sentenced to jail terms.  The rest pled guilty and were either sentenced to prison or, if they had cooperated, to probation.  One KPMG partner was later deported. </p><p>The SEC issued a press release describing its charges against the six individuals and the SEC&#8217;s chairman at the time, Jay Clayton, issued a separate statement. Clayton attempted to calm any concerns about KPMG&#8217;s future and also pointed to actions the PCAOB would take. Clayton said he understood that &#8220;when the alleged breaches were first discovered, the [PCAOB] Board members and staff at the time took remedial action, including with respect to the PCAOB&#8217;s internal information technology and security controls.&#8221; Clayton also asked PCAOB Chairman Duhnke to review and take further action, if necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Again, the PCAOB deferred to the SEC and did not issue a press release but did respond to some media inquiries.</p><p>The PCAOB did tell the Wall Street Journal that it would implement a new &#8220;cooling-off&#8221; period for senior inspections staff, prohibiting them from seeking employment with an audit firm that they had inspected until one year after the inspections. The PCAOB&#8217;s Ethics Code did not prohibit staff from joining firms they were involved in inspecting. &nbsp;Two of the indicted former KPMG employees with prior PCAOB experience had both previously been assigned to the PCAOB team tasked with inspecting KPMG. &nbsp;</p><p>The PCAOB escaped most of what little media coverage and other scrutiny occurred. Only one PCAOB professional, Jeffrey Wada, was charged by the SEC and arrested, tried, and convicted in a criminal trial in March of 2019. </p><p>There are many, many things I could put on a to-do list for the new PCAOB board members, but I am going to limit my comments today to just a few urgent ones. They speak directly to transparency &#8212;&nbsp;about the KPMG-PCAOB scandal and about how the Board should promote transparency in the future.</p><p>1) <strong>Issue a report of actions taken by the PCAOB after the KPMG scandal:</strong> Despite Clayton&#8217;s mention of remedial action by the PCAOB after a review of what happened during the KPMG scandal, there&#8217;s never been a public report of any findings, recommendations, or remedial action. I asked Clayton and Duhnke and other PCAOB officials about a report more then once and was rebuffed. It&#8217;s kind of an arrogant &#8220;do as I say, not as I do&#8221; attitude given how strongly the regulator enforces accountability for review, remediation, and reporting by its regulated entities and how auditors must enforce such activities in the event of internal control weaknesses at public companies.</p><p>2) <strong>Implement more stringent cooling-off and post-employment rules:</strong> I asked a PCAOB spokesperson if the agency ever implemented the revised &#8220;cooling-off&#8221; period that was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-the-kpmg-conspiracy-case-revealed-about-its-audits-1516810866">promised to the Wall Street Journal</a>.&nbsp; <em><strong>The response was that it did not.</strong></em> Stricter constraints on movement between a PCAOB inspections team for a particular firm and subsequent employment by that same firm is just common sense.</p><p>3) <strong>Work with an SEC that isn&#8217;t undermining the PCAOB, for a change, and a Democratically-controlled Congress to get the transparency <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/house-committee-takes-up-audit-regulator-legislation-2019-06-19">legislation that has been introduced over and over</a> finally through Congress:</strong> The Sarbanes-Oxley Act currently requires the PCAOB to keep its investigations and disciplinary proceedings confidential at least until the case is appealed to the SEC, the SEC elects on its own to review the PCAOB&#8217;s final decision, or the opportunity for SEC review has passed. Various bills have been repeatedly introduced over the years in the Senate as well as<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/storyFA428CD2-36BE-11E5-99C5-21B7E5B59B39">&nbsp;in the House</a>, but each time has met with defeat after&nbsp;<a href="https://promarket.org/global-audit-firms-led-deloitte-using-lobbying-clout-dilute-sarbanes-oxley-reforms/">significant lobbying&nbsp;</a>by the largest audit firms.</p><p>Passage of such a bill may allow investors to find out if the PCAOB is actually investigating EY for its apparent independence violations at Coca Cola, investigating a whistleblower tip from Mauro Botta, and following up on <a href="https://promarket.org/2020/02/26/how-regulators-and-pwc-fooled-reporters-again/">PwC&#8217;s alleged auditor independence violations reported by Mattel</a>, for example. &nbsp;</p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:41657804,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thedig.substack.com/p/the-pcaob-hasnt-published-pandemic&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:526,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;The Dig&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b61caeda-6cad-405d-b10e-d192dc7580d7_256x256.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The PCAOB hasn't published pandemic period audit inspection results yet but PwC promises nearly zero defects&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;In our teaching case, Corruption in the Auditor Inspection Process: The Case of KPMG and the PCAOB, we asked students to reflect on the dramatic improvement in KPMG&#8217;s Public Company Accounting Oversight Board inspection results from 2014 to 2015: Did any other firm exhibit dramatic improvement in inspection results in a short period?
