For many, this is a simple question with an easy answer: whatever somebody is willing to pay for it. In practice, valuation is critically important to the core functioning of finance over the long run. How value is determined &#8211; and who gets to do the determining &#8211; can make the difference between fortunes won and lost. As with all such circumstances, if there is big money on the line, there will be people with the means, opportunity, and motive to stretch the boundaries and grab more than their fair share of it.</p><p>In the public stock markets, valuation seems straightforward. Stocks trade hands between willing buyers and sellers during market hours, and when the markets close there&#8217;s a final trading price for the day. But things aren&#8217;t always so transparent. Imagine you are a money manager with a large position in XYZ stock. It is somewhat illiquid in that it doesn&#8217;t trade in big volumes. Since your compensation depends in part on the closing value of XYZ on December 31st, you decide to make a series of small buys in the last few minutes into the close, artificially pushing the value of XYZ up by 5%. Your entire stake now gets marked there, but it isn&#8217;t real - you have merely &#8220;painted the tape.&#8221; This brilliant meme from <a href="https://twitter.com/Keubiko">@Keubiko</a> captures the essence of the issue well:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cc3e058-cae6-4b10-92fb-b005554a78e4_480x362.gif"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cc3e058-cae6-4b10-92fb-b005554a78e4_480x362.gif 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cc3e058-cae6-4b10-92fb-b005554a78e4_480x362.gif 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cc3e058-cae6-4b10-92fb-b005554a78e4_480x362.gif 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cc3e058-cae6-4b10-92fb-b005554a78e4_480x362.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cc3e058-cae6-4b10-92fb-b005554a78e4_480x362.gif" width="480" height="362" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1cc3e058-cae6-4b10-92fb-b005554a78e4_480x362.gif&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:362,&quot;width&quot;:480,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2282624,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/gif&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cc3e058-cae6-4b10-92fb-b005554a78e4_480x362.gif 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cc3e058-cae6-4b10-92fb-b005554a78e4_480x362.gif 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cc3e058-cae6-4b10-92fb-b005554a78e4_480x362.gif 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cc3e058-cae6-4b10-92fb-b005554a78e4_480x362.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Painting a happy little tape | credit: @Keubiko</figcaption></figure></div><p>Now, there are rules against such manipulations in the public markets, but what if XYZ Company is a privately-held startup? </p><p>If a founder sells 15% of her startup to an accredited investor in exchange for an injection of $150,000, then it might be fair to say her company is worth $1 million.

SoftBank is a large Japanese conglomerate consisting of run-of-the-mill operating companies and a staggering array of aggressive private investments deployed through all manner of complex structures, often with significant leverage. Known as a swashbuckling gambler with an incredible tolerance for volatility, Masa Son is famous for his bizarre investor presentations during which he rails against the value the public markets assign to the whole of SoftBank, especially compared to what he believes is its proper sum-of-the-parts valuation. Below is a famous <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/technology/golden-geese-and-unicorns-inside-the-eccentric-presentations-of-masayoshi-son">moment</a> from his 2020 presentation, delivered at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, during which Masa Son claimed SoftBank&#8217;s equity was worth 25 trillion Yen, yet the market was assigning it only 9 trillion Yen (on the slide, he&#8217;s backing out the 4 trillion Yen in SoftBank debt).</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff23d8144-8f7e-408e-9263-655677bf7fb0_1200x799.jpeg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff23d8144-8f7e-408e-9263-655677bf7fb0_1200x799.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff23d8144-8f7e-408e-9263-655677bf7fb0_1200x799.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff23d8144-8f7e-408e-9263-655677bf7fb0_1200x799.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff23d8144-8f7e-408e-9263-655677bf7fb0_1200x799.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff23d8144-8f7e-408e-9263-655677bf7fb0_1200x799.jpeg" width="674" height="448.77166666666665" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f23d8144-8f7e-408e-9263-655677bf7fb0_1200x799.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:799,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:674,&quot;bytes&quot;:40864,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff23d8144-8f7e-408e-9263-655677bf7fb0_1200x799.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff23d8144-8f7e-408e-9263-655677bf7fb0_1200x799.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff23d8144-8f7e-408e-9263-655677bf7fb0_1200x799.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff23d8144-8f7e-408e-9263-655677bf7fb0_1200x799.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Masa Son math | photo credit: Bloomberg</figcaption></figure></div><p>Perhaps the absurd story of the Masa-backed Indian startup OYO Rooms (OYO) might explain some of the market&#8217;s skepticism.</p><p>We&#8217;ve long been fascinated with OYO and its young founder, Ritesh Agarwal.

Following immense growth of the now global hotel chain business, <strong>Agarwal opted to increase his 10% stake to 30%</strong> via a Cayman Islands company called RA Hospitality Holdings, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/oyo-hotel-founder-buys-2-billion-in-shares-back-from-vc-investors-11563542385">according</a> to The Wall Street Journal. <strong>SoftBank has also increased its percent ownership as part of this round</strong>, now owning nearly half of the company.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>To the casual observer, this would seem like an incredibly bullish development. The company is now worth $10 billion! The OYO CEO was so confident in his company&#8217;s prospects that he personally bought $2 billion worth of stock! What&#8217;s not to like? This mark made OYO among the most valuable investments in SoftBank&#8217;s portfolio at that time. When <em><strong>we</strong></em> first read this announcement, we wondered why the bluest of blue-chip VC firms, Sequoia and Lightspeed, were bailing on a huge chunk of their investment in such a hot startup, and how a founder in his early 20s without a major exit under his belt could get his hands on $2 billion in cash? As it <a href="https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/masayoshi-son-s-2-billion-guarantee-at-risk-as-coronavirus-hits-star-entrepreneur-ritesh-agarwal-s-oyo-11586746195051.html">turns out</a>, Agarwal <em><strong>borrowed</strong></em> the money, leveraging a personal guarantee <em><strong>from Masa Son himself</strong></em> to buy the shares at the new, elevated valuation:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>In a highly unusual move, <strong>Agarwal, now 26, borrowed $2 billion to buy shares in his own company as the valuation rose, and Son personally guaranteed the loans from financial institutions</strong>, including Mizuho Financial Group Inc.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Highly unusual, indeed.</p><p>According to (paywalled) data from <em>CrunchBase</em>, SoftBank led OYO&#8217;s $100 million Series B round in July 2015 and its $90 million Series C round in August 2016. SoftBank Vision Fund then led OYO&#8217;s $250 million Series D round in September 2017 and its $650 million Series E round in September 2018. Presumably, all these injections funded cash-burning growth and came at progressively higher valuations.</p><p>With the July 2019 transaction, the CEO of SoftBank painted the tape by effectively lending money to the CEO of a startup that he and his affiliated entities had already gone all-in on. The headline became the higher valuation. How Agarwal funded his increased stake and the fact that Sequoia and Lightspeed had liquidated much of their OYO stock became afterthoughts. SoftBank promptly marked its various investments in OYO at the <em><strong>new</strong></em> $10 billion &#8220;valuation,&#8221; which is no minor thing since Masa Son is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-15/softbank-founder-son-loses-25-billion-in-tech-s-brutal-winter?sref=QV0pAzKC">known to pledge</a> substantial portions of his personal holdings <em><strong>in SoftBank stock</strong></em> for loans to fund his lifestyle and other investments.</p><p>In this seemingly endless loop of conflicting motivations and circular finance, was OYO <em><strong>really</strong></em> worth $10 billion in July of 2019? Does <em>25 &#8211; 4 = 9?</em> make more sense now?&nbsp; Nearly three years later, presumably with the depths of the Covid-19 crisis behind it, OYO is still a serious cash burner and seems to be struggling to generate enthusiasm for its planned initial public offering (IPO). Here&#8217;s how <em>Bloomberg</em> recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-17/softbank-backed-oyo-said-to-mull-halving-ipo-size-as-markets-sag?sref=QV0pAzKC">described</a> the situation:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>Oyo, the high-profile affordable lodging startup that filed for an initial public offering last year, <strong>is considering slashing its fundraising target by half or even shelving the debut</strong>, according to people familiar with the matter.</em></p><p><em>Faced with headwinds including slumping stock markets, Oyo-operator Oravel Stays Ltd. could clip its Indian IPO from the nearly $1 billion initially sought to half that, the people said, declining to be identified discussing internal matters. <strong>It&#8217;s considering also halving its expected valuation from the $12 billion originally targeted, they said.</strong> Oyo could even decide to suspend its IPO plans, the people said.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>By our math, half of 12 is 6, which is decidedly less than 10, and we suspect this IPO will get shelved lest a new and unfavorable &#8220;valuation&#8221; force SoftBank to write down its investments. With Chinese internet stocks crashing and US growth stocks swooning under the pressure of increased interest rates, SoftBank&#8217;s solvency itself is slowly moving into focus. The cost to insure against a SoftBank default has been creeping higher in the past several months, recently reaching levels not seen since March of 2020.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab0eb6f9-7b86-4350-9517-9978449ad37b_2874x1476.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab0eb6f9-7b86-4350-9517-9978449ad37b_2874x1476.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab0eb6f9-7b86-4350-9517-9978449ad37b_2874x1476.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab0eb6f9-7b86-4350-9517-9978449ad37b_2874x1476.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab0eb6f9-7b86-4350-9517-9978449ad37b_2874x1476.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab0eb6f9-7b86-4350-9517-9978449ad37b_2874x1476.png" width="1456" height="748" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ab0eb6f9-7b86-4350-9517-9978449ad37b_2874x1476.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:748,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1086133,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab0eb6f9-7b86-4350-9517-9978449ad37b_2874x1476.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab0eb6f9-7b86-4350-9517-9978449ad37b_2874x1476.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab0eb6f9-7b86-4350-9517-9978449ad37b_2874x1476.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab0eb6f9-7b86-4350-9517-9978449ad37b_2874x1476.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a></figure></div><p>The entertainment value of Masa Son&#8217;s antics aside, we flag these events because of their potentially systemic nature, and as a warning for what the consequences might be if he is ever forced to play this game in reverse. As anyone with experience in the VC sector can attest, Masa Son threw around so much money to so many startups at such eye-watering valuations that most other VC firms were forced to follow suit, creating a self-reinforcing pattern of ever-higher valuation comparisons as the basis for the pricing of the next hot deal. We suspect the bubble in the private sector is even bigger than the one transpiring in the public markets.</p><p>We conclude with some thoughts on how a potential collapse in private valuations might put downward pressure on the public markets. Several large and well-known hedge funds have seen the allure of alpha in the private markets and have invested accordingly. Such crossover funds hold a mix of <em><strong>both</strong></em> private and public securities, selling allocators on the idea that excess returns can be achieved with manageable incremental risk. Mega funds Coatue Management and Tiger Global Management have been particularly active in this way, and both have been in the news recently. Here&#8217;s an interesting <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/markets/coatue-investors-pulling-250-million-get-hit-with-side-pocket">story</a> on Coatue that caught our eye last week:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>Coatue Management investors are pulling $250 million from the firm&#8217;s main hedge fund. But they won&#8217;t get all the money they&#8217;re asking for. <strong>Assets invested in private companies will be withheld by Coatue and placed in a side-pocket, according to people familiar with the matter</strong>. That amounts to 13% of the cash being sought by clients -- a total of $33 million.</em></p><p><em>Coatue&#8217;s decision comes as the firm, like many industry peers, <strong>has increasingly invested in private companies</strong>, hoping to see outsized gains when these enterprises go public. About 11% of Coatue&#8217;s main hedge fund, which ran $15 billion as of year-end, is comprised of private firms. <strong>But as market volatility increases asset managers may be forced to mark down the value of their non-public stakes</strong>.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Dealing with redemptions is always challenging, and the danger of holding a mix of liquid and illiquid securities only exacerbates the problem. When cash needs to be produced in short order, one tends to discover just how much truth is in the price being carried on the books.</p><p>For its part, Tiger Global Management has been investing in private companies at a staggering pace, making it the most prolific VC investor in the world last year. Here&#8217;s how the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiger-global-closes-on-12-7-billion-for-latest-growth-fund-11647626626">reported</a> on it last week:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>As an investor, Tiger Global surpassed all other venture firms last year, <strong>backing 335 deals</strong>, a more than fourfold increase from the 79 transactions it did in 2020, according to data provider CB Insights. The firm picked up the pace as this year began, <strong>doing two deals each business day into mid-February, the data show.</strong></em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve heard the whispers from our friends in the VC sector about the crazy valuations Tiger is paying to close these deals, and one wonders just how much due diligence can be going on when you are doing two deals a day. Perhaps it is just a coincidence that <em>Bloomberg</em> recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-02/tiger-global-s-long-only-fund-fell-11-in-february-market-swoon?sref=QV0pAzKC">reported</a> on Tiger&#8217;s rough start to 2022:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>Chase Coleman&#8217;s Tiger Global Management posted a 10% decline for its flagship hedge fund last month, a significantly steeper drop than the broader market, according to people familiar with the matter. That follows a 14.8% swoon in January, <strong>extending its loss for the year to 23%</strong></em><strong>.</strong>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Most financial crises find their genesis in obscure parts of the markets that fly under the radar until it is too late to stop the contagion. Will the bubble in private market valuations be the catalyst for the next major downturn? We&#8217;ll be watching this space closely.</p><p><em><strong>If you enjoy the work of Team Doomberg and have not yet signed up to receive new articles directly to your inbox, we encourage you to subscribe below.

Eisenhower</p><p>It was a spooky time to be out at sea off the US East Coast on Halloween in 1991. A strong storm system over the maritime provinces in Canada merged with the remnants of Hurricane Grace, forming a new, epic, and dangerous Nor&#8217;easter. The winds of this new storm breached 70 miles per hour and a wave as high as <em><strong>100 feet</strong></em> was measured off the coast of Nova Scotia, but the storm was not renamed as either a tropical storm or a hurricane &#8211; instead, it is known only colloquially as simply the Perfect Storm. Six fishermen from Massachusetts perished when their vessel <em>Andrea Gail</em> sunk in open waters, and the story of the storm and of that tragedy became the subject of a best-selling book and a blockbuster feature film.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc42c77f2-8438-4e2a-a04c-3dd00a47e4f9_735x563.jpeg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc42c77f2-8438-4e2a-a04c-3dd00a47e4f9_735x563.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc42c77f2-8438-4e2a-a04c-3dd00a47e4f9_735x563.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc42c77f2-8438-4e2a-a04c-3dd00a47e4f9_735x563.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc42c77f2-8438-4e2a-a04c-3dd00a47e4f9_735x563.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc42c77f2-8438-4e2a-a04c-3dd00a47e4f9_735x563.jpeg" width="608" height="465.7197278911565" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c42c77f2-8438-4e2a-a04c-3dd00a47e4f9_735x563.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:563,&quot;width&quot;:735,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:608,&quot;bytes&quot;:33629,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc42c77f2-8438-4e2a-a04c-3dd00a47e4f9_735x563.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc42c77f2-8438-4e2a-a04c-3dd00a47e4f9_735x563.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc42c77f2-8438-4e2a-a04c-3dd00a47e4f9_735x563.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc42c77f2-8438-4e2a-a04c-3dd00a47e4f9_735x563.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a></figure></div><p>While the concept of a perfect storm is often too casually assigned in popular culture, it is difficult to find a more apt description of what has been unfolding in the global agriculture markets over these past several months. The tempest caused by the European energy disaster has merged with the hurricane of consequences flowing from Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, forming the genesis of a generational crisis in food that will leave few unaffected. While we&#8217;ve been <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/starvation-diet?s=w">warning</a> about just such a scenario for some time, after spending the past two weeks traveling across the US Midwest and conferring with our contacts in the agricultural sector, even we are a little spooked by what we&#8217;ve learned. In a financial crash, the correlation between all asset classes converges to one. The coming crash in global food supply will be driven by a similar phenomenon across virtually every <em><strong>input</strong></em> into farming &#8211; they are all spiking to historic highs simultaneously, supply availability is diminishing across the spectrum, and the time to reverse the worst of the upcoming consequences is rapidly running short.</p><p>Other than that, things are great.</p><p>We begin with the price of fertilizer, which has been soaring to record highs across the globe. Key sources of nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorous &#8211; important inputs into soil fertility, crop yield, and plant maintenance &#8211; have all gone vertical. Ammonia is derived directly from natural gas, and the price of natural gas outside of the US has gone vertical. It's no surprise that the price of ammonia has tripled over the past twelve months. Belarus is the third-largest supplier of potash in the world and its state-owned miner, Belaruskali, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-17/belarus-potash-maker-roils-fertilizer-markets-with-force-majeure?sref=QV0pAzKC">declared</a> <em>force majeure </em>after sanctions were imposed by the US and Europe. The number two supplier of potash globally? Russia. Perhaps front-running the Russian move on Ukraine, China <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/starvation-diet?s=w">halted</a> phosphate exports <em><strong>last fall</strong></em> in an effort to ensure adequate domestic supply. The combined impact of these events can be seen in the Green Markets North American Fertilize Index, which tracks a blend of fertilizer prices globally:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1814aae2-dcf1-4bce-9d82-b4ab9c63b066_2712x1356.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1814aae2-dcf1-4bce-9d82-b4ab9c63b066_2712x1356.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1814aae2-dcf1-4bce-9d82-b4ab9c63b066_2712x1356.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1814aae2-dcf1-4bce-9d82-b4ab9c63b066_2712x1356.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1814aae2-dcf1-4bce-9d82-b4ab9c63b066_2712x1356.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1814aae2-dcf1-4bce-9d82-b4ab9c63b066_2712x1356.png" width="1456" height="728" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1814aae2-dcf1-4bce-9d82-b4ab9c63b066_2712x1356.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:728,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:969854,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1814aae2-dcf1-4bce-9d82-b4ab9c63b066_2712x1356.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1814aae2-dcf1-4bce-9d82-b4ab9c63b066_2712x1356.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1814aae2-dcf1-4bce-9d82-b4ab9c63b066_2712x1356.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1814aae2-dcf1-4bce-9d82-b4ab9c63b066_2712x1356.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a></figure></div><p>Weed control is an important element of farming, and herbicides are an irreplaceable tool in the farmer&#8217;s repertoire. The most heavily used herbicide in the world is the controversial molecule glyphosate, known widely by its retail brand name Roundup. Invented by Monsanto (which is now owned by Bayer) in the 1970s, glyphosate has been linked to certain blood cancers and is targeted for elimination by many environmental groups. Despite these concerns, glyphosate remains a systemically important molecule &#8211; many seeds have been genetically modified to be resistant to it, allowing for its widespread use while minimizing damage to crops, and generics have expanded the market as it came off Monsanto&#8217;s patent.</p><p>Glyphosate is effectively little more than an elegantly modified fertilizer, containing both phosphorous and nitrogen. It is derived from similar starting materials &#8211; including ammonia &#8211; and, as such, its price has soared amid chronic supply shortages. This has caused the price of other herbicides to rise as farmers desperately seek substitutes, as described by this <a href="https://www.producer.com/news/glyphosate-hiccup-triggers-domino-effect/">article</a> in <em>The Western Producer</em> (emphasis added throughout)<em>:</em></p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em><strong>The much-ballyhooed glyphosate shortage is just the first domino to fall</strong>, according to a leading crop protection company.</em></p><p><em>&#8216;<strong>The knock-on effect on basically every other herbicide molecule is starting to manifest itself</strong>,&#8217; said Cornie Thiessen, general manager of ADAMA Canada. &#8216;We are seeing quite a <strong>domino effect in the market</strong> because of the glyphosate challenges.&#8217;</em></p><p><em>Bayer was already warning customers in late 2021 about a potential glyphosate shortage.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>If farmers skimp on herbicides to get by <em><strong>this</strong></em> season, it only makes dealing with weeds more challenging in the <em><strong>future</strong></em>. As one expert warned us, it only takes one year of negligence to do several years of damage to a field.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66f21b6c-6ad9-4608-81e4-8320f567c219_2866x1444.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66f21b6c-6ad9-4608-81e4-8320f567c219_2866x1444.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66f21b6c-6ad9-4608-81e4-8320f567c219_2866x1444.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66f21b6c-6ad9-4608-81e4-8320f567c219_2866x1444.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66f21b6c-6ad9-4608-81e4-8320f567c219_2866x1444.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66f21b6c-6ad9-4608-81e4-8320f567c219_2866x1444.png" width="1456" height="734" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/66f21b6c-6ad9-4608-81e4-8320f567c219_2866x1444.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:734,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:976300,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66f21b6c-6ad9-4608-81e4-8320f567c219_2866x1444.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66f21b6c-6ad9-4608-81e4-8320f567c219_2866x1444.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66f21b6c-6ad9-4608-81e4-8320f567c219_2866x1444.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66f21b6c-6ad9-4608-81e4-8320f567c219_2866x1444.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a></figure></div><p>Diesel is another significant input into farming, and it too is facing a global supply crunch. Javier Blas, an energy and commodities columnist at <em>Bloomberg</em> whose Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/JavierBlas">account</a> is an absolute must-follow, recently published an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-03-14/ukraine-war-the-oil-price-rally-is-bad-the-diesel-crisis-is-far-worse?sref=5dj0X2VO">editorial</a> sounding the alarm:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>The dire diesel supply situation predates the Russian invasion of Ukraine. While global oil demand hasn&#8217;t yet reached its pre-pandemic level, <strong>global diesel consumption surged to a fresh all-time high in the fourth quarter of 2021</strong>. The boom reflects the lopsided Covid economic recovery, with transportation demand spiking to ease supply-chain messes.</em></p><p><em>European refineries have struggled to match this revival in demand. <strong>One key reason is pricey natural gas. Refineries use gas to produce hydrogen, which they then use to remove sulphur from diesel. The spike in gas prices in late 2021 made that process prohibitively expensive, cutting diesel output</strong>.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Once again, we discover the vital role natural gas plays in many downstream verticals, a key <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/where-stuff-comes-from?s=w">theme</a> of <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/the-windmill-that-almost-spoiled?s=w">many</a> <em>Doomberg</em> pieces. With inventories at record lows and <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/how-to-brick-an-entire-economy?s=w">supplies constrained</a>, the retail price of diesel in the US smashed previous record highs. In Europe, which depends heavily on Russian imports for both diesel and its semi-processed oil precursor, the wholesale market is on the verge of breaking.

The same chip shortage constraining automobile production has struck the farming equipment industry, making new equipment and spare parts harder to come by. Farmers in Iowa recently <a href="https://www.agriculture.com/news/business/farmers-seek-relief-from-soaring-fuel-prices-supply-shortages">vented</a> their frustration at a Republican forum on agriculture:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>&#8230;they bemoaned the hit-and-miss availability of parts to fix their equipment &#8212; the result of pandemic disruptions in the production of those parts. Iowa Rep. Ross Paustian, R-Walcott, is a farmer who said his neighbor was forced to buy a hydraulic pump for his tractor from a Nebraska dealership <strong>because it was the only place in the country that had it stocked</strong>.</em></p><p><em>Jim Boyer, an Emmet County farmer, had a similar, personal anecdote. <strong>He&#8217;s awaiting a $40 emissions-related sensor for his tractor, and he&#8217;s not sure if it will arrive anytime soon.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>&#8216;I cannot drive that tractor &#8212; a quarter-million-dollar piece of equipment &#8212; because I cannot get that sensor,&#8217; </strong>he said.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Compounding these challenges with machinery is a burgeoning labor shortage that is rapidly adding pressure to this brewing catastrophe. Although the labor issues in the US span well beyond agriculture, there are aspects that exacerbate the impact on farmers, including the physical labor intensity and seasonality of many roles, as well as the reliance on foreign laborers to fill key positions US citizens have historically shunned. This is especially challenging in light of vaccine mandates at border crossings. Here&#8217;s a recent <a href="https://www.wpr.org/wisconsin-farms-are-feeling-squeeze-tight-labor-market">report</a> from Wisconsin Public Radio which describes the challenges well:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>While some farms employ workers all year round, Strader said <strong>many jobs are seasonal, starting in March and April and going until late fall when harvest ends</strong>.</em></p><p><em><strong>With producers on edge about hiring for this year</strong>, Strader said many farms started recruiting earlier than usual and developed a contingency plan for how to make it through the season without employees. <strong>That could mean discontinuing certain markets or scaling back the variety of produce that they&#8217;re growing.</strong></em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Farmers are also competing with other sectors for a limited pool of labor. The gap between job openings and unemployed but willing workers across the entire US continues to widen:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85e2a981-e13a-43d6-9159-707ddc068315_2876x1452.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85e2a981-e13a-43d6-9159-707ddc068315_2876x1452.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85e2a981-e13a-43d6-9159-707ddc068315_2876x1452.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85e2a981-e13a-43d6-9159-707ddc068315_2876x1452.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85e2a981-e13a-43d6-9159-707ddc068315_2876x1452.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85e2a981-e13a-43d6-9159-707ddc068315_2876x1452.png" width="1456" height="735" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/85e2a981-e13a-43d6-9159-707ddc068315_2876x1452.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:735,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:941922,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85e2a981-e13a-43d6-9159-707ddc068315_2876x1452.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85e2a981-e13a-43d6-9159-707ddc068315_2876x1452.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85e2a981-e13a-43d6-9159-707ddc068315_2876x1452.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85e2a981-e13a-43d6-9159-707ddc068315_2876x1452.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a></figure></div><p>Even generously assuming farmers can cobble together enough fertilizer, herbicide, machinery, and labor to produce a good harvest this fall, they may be left to deal with yet another crisis of supply that few off the field have on their radar: propane.

Grain drying. Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain_drying">primer</a> on the importance of drying, from <em>Wikipedia:</em></p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em><strong>Hundreds of millions of tonnes</strong> of wheat, corn, soybean, rice and other grains as sorghum, sunflower seeds, rapeseed/canola, barley, oats, etc., <strong>are dried in grain dryers</strong>. In the main agricultural countries, drying comprises the reduction of moisture from about 17-30% w/w to values between 8 and 15% w/w, depending on the grain. <strong>The final moisture content for drying must be adequate for storage.</strong></em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Many farms are located in rural areas without ready access to natural gas, and thus <a href="https://propane.com/propane-products/grain-dryers/">some 80%</a> of grain dryers in the US, for example, rely on propane as a fuel. In a piece we <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/an-urgent-call-on-line-5?s=w">wrote</a> in December called <em>An Urgent Call on Line 5</em>, we chronicled how progressive politicians and environmental groups were targeting an important pipeline artery that runs from Canada, under the Straits of Mackinac, and across the State of Michigan.

In a staggering defiance of logic, many US politicians are<em><strong> still</strong></em> attacking the lifeblood <em><strong>of our own</strong></em> energy production infrastructure, looking to score political points against &#8220;the other team,&#8221; blaming price-taking producers of global commodities for gouging, threatening producers of energy with windfall profits taxes, resisting calls to remove bureaucratic hurdles to new production, and refusing to open an introductory physics textbook to help guide them through the suite of policy choices that require true leadership to get right. They remain stuck in an endless loop of platitudes, blamestorming, corruption, and ignorance.</p><p>As Eisenhower aptly identifies in our opening quote, distance has an anesthetizing effect on the observer of any occurrence. One wonders how many people will starve before our politicians get serious. The populations most at risk of falling off the edge are half a world away and we worry that that number is uncomfortably high.</p><p>At <em>Doomberg</em>, we pride ourselves on seeing patterns early and being months ahead of the news flow. We are consistently human-centric. Never have we been more certain in our beliefs while fervently wishing that we are wrong. A global famine is no joke, and correctly forecasting one would bring no joy.</p><p><em><strong>If you support the work of Team Doomberg and have not yet signed up to receive new articles directly to your inbox, we encourage you to subscribe below.

While few have made vast fortunes betting on companies that go on to hit the literal mother lode, most stand little chance of realizing notable gains. The sector is both challenging to grasp from a technical perspective and filled with all manner of hucksters willing to say and do whatever it takes to separate amateurs from their money. A scratch-off lottery ticket flips from being a bad investment to a good one if you can trick somebody else into paying for yours.</p><p>When judging the potential economic value of a gold deposit, there are three critical questions: how much gold is in the ground, at what average concentration, and in what form? While all three are important, the last one is often the strongest determinant of gold mine economics. How the gold presents itself in a deposit dictates the means needed to isolate it in pure form, and those means can vary from easy to nearly impossible &#8211; at least financially.</p><p>On the easy end of the spectrum sit placer gold deposits that result from the weathering and disintegration of rock formations containing seams of gold, thus liberating the precious metals. Creeks and rivers then transport and concentrate the relatively pure gold over millennia, often depositing it at ancient river bends and in bedrock depressions. Placer gold can be isolated with water and gravity, using contraptions as simple as a pan or as sophisticated as a sluice box.

It&#8217;s a different story for the class of deposits known as <em><strong>sulfide ores</strong></em>, where the gold is surrounded by sulfides of iron. Sulfide ores are so difficult to mine they are often categorized as <em><strong>refractory deposits</strong></em>, and the gold industry has spent decades trying to develop cost-effective methods to free this gold from its stubborn prison. Here&#8217;s how a recent study from McKinsey <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/metals-and-mining/our-insights/refractory-gold-ores-challenges-and-opportunities-for-a-key-source-of-growth">frames</a> the issue (emphasis added throughout):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em><strong>Gold miners are facing a reserves crisis, and what is left in the ground is becoming more and more challenging to process</strong>. Refractory gold reserves, which require more sophisticated treatment methods in order to achieve oxide-ore recovery rates, correspond to 24 percent of current gold reserves and 22 percent of gold resources worldwide (Exhibit 1). <strong>Despite offering a higher grade, these ores can only be processed using specific pretreatment methods</strong> such as ultrafine grinding, bio oxidation, roasting, or pressure oxidation (POX).</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Knowing this, imagine our shock when we woke up on Tuesday, March 15, to the news that AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC) had invested in a gold mine!&nbsp; We&#8217;ve had our fair share of fun with AMC&#8217;s chair and CEO Adam Aron, detailing how he shamelessly fleeces retail investors <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/super-stonks-amc-entertainment-holdings?s=w">here</a> and <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/no-planet-for-the-apes?s=w">here</a>, but even we were taken aback by this nonsensical press release:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>AMC Theatres (NYSE: AMC), <strong>the largest theatrical exhibitor</strong> in the United States, in Europe &amp; the Middle East, and in the world, today announced <strong>it is buying 22% of Hycroft Mining Holding Corporation</strong> (NASDAQ: HYMC), which holds the 71,000 acre Hycroft Mine in northern Nevada. Independent third-party studies confirm that the Hycroft Mine has some 15 million ounces of gold resources and some 600 million ounces of silver resources. In addition, AMC will receive an additional 23.4 million warrants in Hycroft at $1.07 per share.</em></p><p><em><strong>Making an investment equal to AMC is Eric Sprott</strong>, one of the world&#8217;s leading gold and silver investors. Combined, AMC and Mr. Sprott are investing $56 million, which will help Hycroft considerably lengthen its financial runway. With its investment, AMC has been granted the right to appoint a representative to the Hycroft Board of Directors.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Further down in the same release is this gem of a quote, which will undoubtedly find a prominent place in the history of corporate silliness:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>Commenting on the investment in Hycroft, Adam Aron chairman and CEO of AMC Entertainment said, &#8216;The strength of SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME and THE BATMAN, as well as 2022&#8217;s promising industry box office, heighten AMC Entertainment&#8217;s conviction that we are on a glide path to recovery. <strong>Our strategic investment being announced today is the result of our having identified a company in an unrelated industry that appears to be just like AMC of a year ago.</strong> It, too, has rock-solid assets, but for a variety of reasons, it has been facing a severe and immediate liquidity issue. Its share price has been knocked low as a result. We are confident that our involvement can greatly help it to surmount its challenges &#8212; to its benefit, and to ours.&#8217;</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Concurrent to the issuance of the press release, Aron took to Twitter and whipped up a retail frenzy:</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1503691713474400257?s=20&amp;t=u0rCgoTyq5p_6WtZvx06uA&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;AMC is playing on offense again with a bold diversification move.

If <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amc-to-buy-stake-in-gold-and-silver-mining-company-hycroft-11647349469">reports</a> are to be believed, this deal came together in a handful of days leaving precious little time for serious review.</p><p>Let&#8217;s dig into what&#8217;s really going on with this transaction.</p><p>Hycroft&#8217;s only mine has been in and out of operation for several decades, but most of the easy oxide ore was <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4438121-hycroft-mining-has-a-lot-of-gold-but-there-are-many-red-flags">mined</a> throughout the 1980s and 90s. While meaningful amounts of gold remain in the ground, it is predominately difficult sulfide ore, and the concentration of gold is quite low. In other words, the Hycroft Mine is <em><strong>a low-grade refractory deposit</strong></em> from which it is nearly impossible to extract gold in a way that makes money. Not that others haven&#8217;t tried.</p><p>In 2014, the mine was owned by Allied Nevada Gold Corporation, which launched an ambitious $1.4 billion plan to revitalize the mine and crack the sulfide ore challenge. By March of 2015, the company <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/allied-nevada-bankruptcy/u-s-gold-miner-allied-nevada-files-for-bankruptcy-idUSL1N0WC1IW20150310">filed</a> for bankruptcy protection:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>U.S.-based gold miner Allied Nevada Gold Corp filed for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday, buckling under a heavy debt load amid weaker metal prices. Allied Nevada, which owns the Hycroft open pit gold and silver mine in Nevada, said in a statement it was filing to restructure its debt, which stood at $543 million at the end of September.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Allied Nevada emerged from bankruptcy as a privately-held company in October of the same year and was renamed Hycroft Mining Corporation. The company continued to wrestle with the difficulty of mining its sulfide ore, with minimal success. In January of 2020, during the early stages of the Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) boom, Hycroft agreed to be acquired by Mudrick Capital Acquisition Corporation and became a publicly-traded company once again on June 1, 2020.

One month after the SPAC deal closed, then-CEO Randy Buffington unexpectedly <a href="http://www.hycroftmining.com/wp-content/uploads/07-01-20-Hycroft-Management-Changes-1.pdf">resigned</a>, and the company hired the executive recruiting firm Korn Ferry to find a replacement. Two months later, the company <a href="http://www.hycroftmining.com/wp-content/uploads/8-31-20-Appointment-of-CEO-FINAL.pdf">hired</a> Dianne Garrett to be its new CEO (we should note that Garrett has an impressive resume and seems to have earnestly attempted to make the best of a terrible situation). Less than a month after taking the reins, and only four months after completing the SPAC transaction, Garrett <a href="http://www.hycroftmining.com/wp-content/uploads/10-06-20-Closing-of-Underwritten-Public-Offering.pdf">tapped</a> the equity markets for more than $80 million of fresh capital.</p><p>In every quarter since the SPAC transaction, Hycroft reported operating losses, negative free cash flow, and continually managed down expectations about the viability of their &#8220;Novel Process&#8221; to economically extract gold from sulfide ores. Then, in mid-November, the company <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hycroft-provides-business-update-and-2021-third-quarter-operating-results-301420898.html">reported</a> its Q3 2021 results with a press release that was a classic &#8220;turn out the lights&#8221; moment. The chair of the board resigned. The chief operating officer &#8211; who had just been <a href="http://75.141.56.102/wp-content/uploads/01-11-21-Leadership-Changes-and-Team-Reorganization_Final.pdf">hired</a> in January of 2021 &#8211; resigned. Most importantly, the company came clean on the failure of the sulfide ore technology, fired half its workforce, and ceased its run-of-mine operations:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>The Company has previously discussed its strategy for developing an economic sulfide process for Hycroft. Based on the Company's findings to date, including the analysis completed by an independent third-party research laboratory and the independent reviews by two metallurgical consultants, <strong>the Company does not believe the novel two-stage sulfide heap oxidation and leach process ("Novel Process"), as currently designed in the 2019 Technical Report dated July 31, 2019 ("2019 Technical Report"), is economic at current metal prices or those metal prices used in the 2019 Technical Report.</strong>&nbsp; Subject to the challenges discussed below, the Company will complete test work that is currently underway and may advance its understanding of the Novel Process in the future.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>A technology miracle was needed to make the Hycroft Mine viable, and none was forthcoming. Virtually every major gold miner in the world has been working on finding economically viable ways to extract gold from refractory deposits, and to think that a decades-old mining operation that spends virtually nothing on research and development and relies on outside consultants and third-party research laboratories for their technology needs would produce a Holy Grail outcome is the height of lunacy.

&#8211; Yogi Berra</p><p>On Monday, March 22, 2021, ViacomCBS (since renamed Paramount Global) announced plans to raise money from the equity markets. For reasons few could understand, the company&#8217;s stock had soared from a Covid-panic low of about $10 a share a year earlier to around $100 at the time of the stock offering. Taking this as a signal of confidence from the market, management made the rational decision to raise money to accelerate and de-risk its execution plans. The company hired Morgan Stanley to be the lead book runner on the deal and hoped to secure $3 billion in fresh capital.</p><p>Raising capital for companies is a core function of banks, and casual observers might assume such activities represent the bulk of what bankers do. They&#8217;d be wrong. As the scandal following the subsequent collapse in ViacomCBS&#8217;s stock laid bare, bankers expend a lot of effort on &#8211; and collect a lot of fees from &#8211; facilitating games of reckless speculation, often skirting the law to do so.</p><p>Unbeknownst to the management of ViacomCBS, a mysterious character with a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2012-2012-264htm">dubious ethical track</a> record had convinced many of the largest and most prestigious banks in the world, including Goldman Sachs, Nomura, Credit Suisse, UBS, and the aforementioned Morgan Stanley, to use <em><strong>their</strong></em> balance sheets to help <em><strong>him</strong></em> effectively amass a huge stake in the company while simultaneously circumventing reporting rules established by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bill Hwang, founder of the family office Archegos Capital, entered into swap agreements with these banks with which he assumed the economic risk associated with the movements of several stocks without formally owning the shares himself. By some estimates, Hwang synthetically owned more than 20% of ViacomCBS and similarly outsized economic stakes in Discovery, Baidu, Tencent Music Entertainment, Vipshop Holdings, Farfetch, and GSX Techedu.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41598c8c-6527-4823-ba5f-498c65d7d632_2400x1350.jpeg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41598c8c-6527-4823-ba5f-498c65d7d632_2400x1350.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41598c8c-6527-4823-ba5f-498c65d7d632_2400x1350.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41598c8c-6527-4823-ba5f-498c65d7d632_2400x1350.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41598c8c-6527-4823-ba5f-498c65d7d632_2400x1350.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41598c8c-6527-4823-ba5f-498c65d7d632_2400x1350.jpeg" width="1456" height="819" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/41598c8c-6527-4823-ba5f-498c65d7d632_2400x1350.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:419189,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41598c8c-6527-4823-ba5f-498c65d7d632_2400x1350.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41598c8c-6527-4823-ba5f-498c65d7d632_2400x1350.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41598c8c-6527-4823-ba5f-498c65d7d632_2400x1350.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41598c8c-6527-4823-ba5f-498c65d7d632_2400x1350.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Bill Hwang | photo credit: Financial Times</figcaption></figure></div><p>Hwang was running this scheme at such a large scale that he was effectively bidding up his own book, creating what Nassim Taleb would call a self-licking lollipop. While the full story of Hwang&#8217;s collapse is yet to be told, it seems as though China&#8217;s unexpected crackdown on internet and online education companies caused some of Hwang&#8217;s holdings to tank, creating a cascading series of margin calls that he could not meet. ViacomCBS&#8217;s ill-timed raise was the grain of sand that grew into an avalanche of losses that ultimately measured over $10 billion. We let the <em>New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/business/bill-hwang-archegos.html">take it</a> from here (emphasis added throughout):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>By Thursday, March 25, Archegos was in critical condition. ViacomCBS's plummeting stock price was setting off &#8216;margin calls,&#8217; or demands for additional cash or assets, from its prime brokers that the firm couldn&#8217;t fully meet. <strong>Hoping to buy time, Archegos called a meeting with its lenders, asking for patience as it unloaded assets quietly</strong>, a person close to the firm said.</em></p><p><em>Those hopes were dashed. <strong>Sensing imminent failure, Goldman began selling Archegos&#8217;s assets the next morning, followed by Morgan Stanley, to recoup their money</strong>. Other banks soon followed.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Setting aside the potential anti-trust issues involved with the meeting called by Archegos, or the comically-predictable development that Goldman Sachs stabbed everybody else on the call in the back by rushing to the exit first (surprise!), or the fact that Morgan Stanley quickly followed suit and flushed <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/01/viacomcbs-stock-sales-amid-archegos-debacle-raise-questions-for-banks.html">large blocks</a> of stock in a company <em><strong>it had just served as lead book runner for</strong></em>, the entire tawdry affair raises many serious questions. Where are the regulators? Why do our largest, most well-resourced banks demonstrate absolute incompetence in risk management and compliance? A year on, why is Bill Hwang still a free man? How were so many bankers, all trained to know better, intent on picking up nickels in front of the Archegos steamroller? Surely, lessons have been learned, right?</p><p>Nope.</p><p>For the latest speculation-fueled folly in market breakdowns, we turn to the historic events unfolding in the nickel market. As has been widely reported, the price of nickel soared to unimaginable heights last week on the back of an epic short squeeze. Xiang Guangda, the self-proclaimed &#8220;Mr. Big Shot&#8221; of the nickel market and owner of Tsingshan Holding Group Co. (the largest nickel producer in the world), made a massive bet <em><strong>against</strong></em> the price of nickel prior to Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, and that bet turned against him, badly. Here&#8217;s how <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-11/jpmorgan-is-biggest-counterparty-for-nickel-tycoon-s-short-bets?sref=QV0pAzKC">describes</a> the situation:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. is <strong>the largest counterparty to the nickel trades</strong> of the Chinese tycoon caught in an unprecedented short squeeze, putting the bank at the center of one of the most dramatic moments in metals market history.</em></p><p><em><strong>About 50,000 tons of Xiang Guangda&#8217;s total nickel short position of over 150,000 tons is held through an over-the-counter position with JPMorgan</strong>, according to people familiar with the matter. Based on that figure, the tycoon&#8217;s company, Tsingshan Holding Group Co., would have owed JPMorgan about $1 billion in margin on Monday. The nickel producer has been struggling to pay margin calls to its banks and brokers, Bloomberg reported this week.</em></p><p><em><strong>JPMorgan is leading discussions between Xiang and roughly 10 banks and brokers through which his nickel short position is held</strong>, the people said, asking not to be identified as the talks are private.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4af28fd-7112-491b-a700-bf1bac308ea9_634x422.jpeg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4af28fd-7112-491b-a700-bf1bac308ea9_634x422.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4af28fd-7112-491b-a700-bf1bac308ea9_634x422.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4af28fd-7112-491b-a700-bf1bac308ea9_634x422.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4af28fd-7112-491b-a700-bf1bac308ea9_634x422.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4af28fd-7112-491b-a700-bf1bac308ea9_634x422.jpeg" width="634" height="422" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e4af28fd-7112-491b-a700-bf1bac308ea9_634x422.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:422,&quot;width&quot;:634,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:39616,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4af28fd-7112-491b-a700-bf1bac308ea9_634x422.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4af28fd-7112-491b-a700-bf1bac308ea9_634x422.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4af28fd-7112-491b-a700-bf1bac308ea9_634x422.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4af28fd-7112-491b-a700-bf1bac308ea9_634x422.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a><figcaption class="image-caption">&#8220;Mr. Big Shot&#8221; | photo credit: This Is Money</figcaption></figure></div><p>In reaction, the London Metal Exchange (LME) took the unprecedented step of <em><strong>retroactively</strong></em> canceling vast swaths of trades as the price of nickel kept rocketing higher. The significance of this decision will continue to reverberate for many years, and we believe it could catalyze <em><strong>the end of the LME itself</strong></em>.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s how London-based <em>Financial News</em> <a href="https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/hedge-fund-titan-clifford-asness-leads-trader-fury-after-lme-cancels-4bn-in-nickel-trades-20220311">explained</a> the move:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>Nickel traders were blindsided this week as the wild ride in the metal saw prices more than double in overnight trading &#8211; <strong>prompting the London Metal Exchange to cancel orders and halt trading</strong>.</em></p><p><em>Nickel trading on the LME still hasn&#8217;t resumed, and the halt will likely extend until at least mid-March as the exchange weighs its options. <strong>The sudden suspension affected an estimated 9,000 trades worth $4bn.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Canceling the trades helped Tsingshan Holding Group.</strong> The China-based stainless steel producer is estimated to <strong>have lost $8bn on its short position</strong>. Because the LME canceled trades, Tsingshan losses are potentially less severe than if the trades had stood. The holding group&#8217;s chair, Xiang Guangda, is reportedly still holding short positions on nickel.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2393962c-8ed5-4f39-b627-d548d9ebdf35_2874x1482.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2393962c-8ed5-4f39-b627-d548d9ebdf35_2874x1482.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2393962c-8ed5-4f39-b627-d548d9ebdf35_2874x1482.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2393962c-8ed5-4f39-b627-d548d9ebdf35_2874x1482.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2393962c-8ed5-4f39-b627-d548d9ebdf35_2874x1482.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2393962c-8ed5-4f39-b627-d548d9ebdf35_2874x1482.png" width="1456" height="751" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2393962c-8ed5-4f39-b627-d548d9ebdf35_2874x1482.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:751,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1826411,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2393962c-8ed5-4f39-b627-d548d9ebdf35_2874x1482.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2393962c-8ed5-4f39-b627-d548d9ebdf35_2874x1482.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2393962c-8ed5-4f39-b627-d548d9ebdf35_2874x1482.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2393962c-8ed5-4f39-b627-d548d9ebdf35_2874x1482.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a></figure></div><p>Of course, if the moves by the LME help Tsingshan &#8211; and by extension their banking counterparties &#8211; they <em><strong>must</strong></em> hurt other investors. There are two sides to every trade, after all. While we are not experts in the nuanced mechanics of how the LME functions in practice, it requires no special knowledge to deduce that if the normal default waterfall had been allowed to occur, the very existence of the LME would have been threatened. Undoubtedly, the LME&#8217;s desperation was inversely proportional to its effective solvency, as the robustness of their default management <a href="https://www.lme.com/en/clearing/risk-management/default-management">plan</a> would have been sorely tested.</p><p>For confirmation, we turn to someone who <em><strong>does</strong></em> have such expertise, namely Russell Clark. Clark has been blogging about the risks posed by clearinghouses for some time at his <a href="https://www.russell-clark.com/">Substack</a>, <em>Capital Flows and Asset Management. </em>In a <a href="https://www.russell-clark.com/p/whats-happening-with-the-lme-and?s=r">piece</a> published last week called <em>What&#8217;s Happening with the LME and Nickel</em>, Clark used a video presentation to walk through the events and their likely consequences. Here&#8217;s a quote that stood out to us:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>For me, the clearinghouse looks (like) a broken financial institution&#8230; <strong>They&#8217;ve gone from being a shock absorber to now a propagator of risk.</strong></em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Yesterday, JPMorgan cut a standstill <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/tsingshan-nickel-lme/tsingshan-agrees-standstill-agreement-on-nickel-margins-with-banks-idUKL5N2VH585">agreement</a> with Tsingshan and the LME hopes to reopen nickel trading tomorrow. The LME also announced 15% daily limit moves across all metals. However things play out from here, we believe the LME is functionally finished. Trust was their bond, and they defaulted on it last week.</p><p>Back in October of 2021, we wrote a <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/doctor-copper-is-sick?s=w">piece</a> called <em>Dr. Copper is Sick</em>, in which we chronicled a similar set of circumstances that unfolded at the LME in the copper market, albeit on a much smaller scale. Still, the behavior of the LME surprised many market participants, and can now be viewed as an ominous foreshadowing. Here&#8217;s how we closed that article:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>More importantly, <strong>the LME damaged its credibility in the marketplace</strong>. It either facilitates price discovery and thereby serves a useful purpose, or it doesn&#8217;t. Apparently, it doesn&#8217;t.</em></p><p><em>Attempts to suppress price inevitably cause product shortages and higher prices down the road, and we expect this time to be no different.&nbsp; <strong>If a well-run physical exchange facilitates lower prices and assures ample supplies, surely a broken exchange does the opposite.</strong></em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine was <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/on-the-cusp-of-an-economic-singularity?s=w">sure</a> to kick off a chaotic series of unpredictable and historic moves in the global financial markets. The functional death of the iconic London Metal Exchange is but the first of what we expect will be many similarly situated institutions to get sucked under the steamroller.</p><p>RIP LME.</p><p><em><strong>If you enjoy reading Doomberg, please do us the HUGE favor of simply pressing the &#8220;Like&#8221;

Despite being twice elected to his position, Quwatli had to go because he was uncompromisingly opposed to granting transit rights to the Trans-Arabian Pipeline project (TAPLINE), then a critical centerpiece of US energy strategy in the Middle East. The proposed pipeline was to carry oil from the prolific fields of Saudi Arabia through Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon, where it could be exported via a terminal in Sidon. Days after the coup, the project was approved by the newly installed Syrian leadership.

The US, Canada, and Mexico have enormous proven energy reserves and the technical know-how to become the dominant energy-producing region on the planet. We can do so cleanly, safely, and domestically &#8211; reducing the strength of our geopolitical enemies and simultaneously creating high-paying jobs, providing a significant and durable competitive advantage to our manufacturing base, and increasing the standard of living of our population and that of our allies. Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent economic destruction of Europe due to an energy crisis of their own making should serve as a <em><strong>serious wake-up call</strong></em> to North America&#8217;s political establishment. Instead of seeking to replace our energy reliance on one dictatorship (Russia) with three others (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/05/world/americas/venezuela-russia-usa.html">Venezuela</a>, <a href="https://www.axios.com/biden-saudi-trip-oil-b7a91070-8045-4155-9120-a35d59fd7603.html">Saudi Arabia</a>, and <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/596950-while-america-watches-the-war-in-ukraine-biden-finalizes-a">Iran</a>), we should be looking <em><strong>inward</strong></em> for the answers to our problems.</p><p>It is time to get serious about energy. Here&#8217;s how <em>Doomberg</em> would do it&#8230;</p><p><strong>Priority 1: Seduce Natural Gas Investment<br></strong>America has spectacularly large and economically accessible deposits of natural gas. Given the crisis we face today, natural gas &#8211; which can be used to produce electricity, heat our homes, feed our domestic fertilizer plants, <em><strong>and</strong></em> enable the production of high-value polysilicon needed for solar cells &#8211; has to be at the core of our revitalization strategy. </p><p>EQT is the largest natural gas producer in the US, and their CEO Toby Rice had this to say when he appeared on Alex Epstein&#8217;s <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/toby-rice-the-ceo-of-americas-largest-natural/id465769847?i=1000538031656">podcast</a> <em>Power Hour</em> (emphasis added throughout; you can follow Epstein on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexEpstein">here</a>):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>Right now, the amount of inventory that we have in the US is really just dependent on the price that we receive. We have a very large inventory that can be economically produced at a $1.50 to $2 gas price. But when you get to $3, $3.50, $4, <strong>the amount of inventory that can actually be developed and generate a decent return for our shareholders multiplies almost exponentially</strong>. So, if gas prices long-term were $4.50, which by the way is the average price of gas over the last 20 years, there is no concern that we would be able to power the world with <strong>American domestic natural gas and really insulate energy demand from extreme price shocks, but we need the tools to be able to do that and that's pipelines and LNG export facilities.</strong></em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Moments later, Rice identified the key problem that needs to be solved:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>You're in a situation today where I think it's very hard pressed for companies to be incentivized to go out and develop this large scale infrastructure that this country needs, this world needs <strong>because of the regulatory uncertainty and just the pressure we get from anti-fossil fuel, keep-it-in-the-ground groups that are out there</strong>.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>President Biden should do everything in his power to accelerate regulatory approval of critical pipeline projects that are constraining natural gas production. He should work with Congress and rewrite laws to allow fast-track approval of developments identified by the industry as important priorities, like the <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/contortion-nation?s=w">Mountain Valley</a>, PennEast, and Atlantic Coast pipeline projects. It is time to put an end to nuisance lawsuits, regulatory inertia, and environmental radicalism. </p><p>It borders on criminal negligence that much of the Northeast <em><strong>burns oil</strong></em> to heat their homes. In addition to the pipeline projects described above, the President should work with Congress to amend <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/new-england-is-an-energy-crisis-waiting?s=w">the Jones Act</a> to create an exception for LNG carriers. This simple move &#8211; which would undoubtedly garner near-unanimous support from both parties &#8211; would allow the Northeast to source its natural gas from LNG export terminals <em><strong>based in the US</strong></em>. Systematically retrofitting homes to convert from oil to natural gas for heating would be expensive, and the President would have to break the union stranglehold on the region&#8217;s home heating infrastructure, but doing so would reduce our carbon footprint while strengthening our energy security.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F984a41a5-8494-4352-a789-0619cf04804b_840x600.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F984a41a5-8494-4352-a789-0619cf04804b_840x600.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F984a41a5-8494-4352-a789-0619cf04804b_840x600.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F984a41a5-8494-4352-a789-0619cf04804b_840x600.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F984a41a5-8494-4352-a789-0619cf04804b_840x600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F984a41a5-8494-4352-a789-0619cf04804b_840x600.png" width="840" height="600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/984a41a5-8494-4352-a789-0619cf04804b_840x600.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:600,&quot;width&quot;:840,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:784447,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F984a41a5-8494-4352-a789-0619cf04804b_840x600.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F984a41a5-8494-4352-a789-0619cf04804b_840x600.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F984a41a5-8494-4352-a789-0619cf04804b_840x600.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F984a41a5-8494-4352-a789-0619cf04804b_840x600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Heating oil</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>Priority 2: Reclaim a Leadership Position in Polysilicon<br></strong>With the natural gas industry unleashed, the President should make co-located production of polysilicon another national priority. The <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/herbie-spoils-the-party?s=w">US blundered</a> into allowing China to secure a dominant position in this critical market, and it is time to reverse that error. Making solar cells is incredibly energy-intensive, and cheap natural gas is the ideal feedstock. There&#8217;s going to be huge demand for solar in the decades ahead, and the only thing stopping the US from being the preferred global supplier is a lack of polysilicon production capacity. It is hard to imagine there would be much opposition to this from either party. The drill-baby-drill crowd gets a new market for domestic natural gas, and the environmentalists get a home-grown ESG industry.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9f1b949-5d67-41a3-8961-77d955d1d358_960x638.jpeg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9f1b949-5d67-41a3-8961-77d955d1d358_960x638.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9f1b949-5d67-41a3-8961-77d955d1d358_960x638.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9f1b949-5d67-41a3-8961-77d955d1d358_960x638.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9f1b949-5d67-41a3-8961-77d955d1d358_960x638.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9f1b949-5d67-41a3-8961-77d955d1d358_960x638.jpeg" width="960" height="638" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c9f1b949-5d67-41a3-8961-77d955d1d358_960x638.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:638,&quot;width&quot;:960,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:236348,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9f1b949-5d67-41a3-8961-77d955d1d358_960x638.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9f1b949-5d67-41a3-8961-77d955d1d358_960x638.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9f1b949-5d67-41a3-8961-77d955d1d358_960x638.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9f1b949-5d67-41a3-8961-77d955d1d358_960x638.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Hemlock Semiconductor plant in Michigan | photo source: MLive.com</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>Priority 3: Recommit to Nuclear<br></strong>The President should work with Congress and various state leaders to halt all planned nuclear electricity plant closings, invest substantial sums in maintenance and life-extension of the existing nuclear fleet, and embark on a massive buildout of advanced nuclear reactors.

Here's how Hawking describes it in his book (emphasis added throughout):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>This means that even if there were events before the big bang, <strong>one could not use them to determine what would happen afterward</strong>, because predictability would break down at the big bang. Correspondingly, if, as is the case, we know only what has happened since the big bang, we could not determine what happened beforehand. <strong>As far as we are concerned, events before the big bang can have no consequences</strong>, so they should not form part of a scientific model of the universe. We should therefore cut them out of the model and say that <strong>time had a beginning at the big bang</strong>. Many people do not like the idea that time has a beginning, probably because it smacks of divine intervention.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>The simple truth of a singularity applies whether it occurred in the past or will in the future: what transpires on the other side is unknowable from here.</p><p>Given the horrific and still-unfolding events of Vladimir Putin&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine and the West&#8217;s collective response to it, one can&#8217;t help but wonder whether we are on the cusp of <em><strong>an economic singularity</strong></em> in which the laws and bedrock beliefs that formed the foundation of international economic order for decades break down. The consequences are similarly unknowable, but we suspect a great reset may indeed be upon us. Even if a ceasefire is announced moments after we publish this piece, shocking damage to the global economic system has undoubtedly already been done and certain genies won&#8217;t easily be put back into their bottles.</p><p>Before proceeding, we should state clearly that what follows is not a critique of the Western response to the invasion but rather an assessment of the potential first- and second-order consequences of these historic moves, as well as speculation on where some of the harshest economic crises might manifest in the near future. While we join in the hope that these measures achieve their desired direct effect, there&#8217;s no denying these are truly unprecedented times.</p><p>The most stunning move by the US and its allies was cutting off the Russian central bank&#8217;s access to most of its $630 billion of foreign reserves. Without access, one wonders if these funds are really &#8220;its&#8221; reserves at all? What is ownership without access? No matter how justified that move might seem today, there&#8217;s no escaping that this action will reverberate for years to come. In a blunt opinion <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/if-currency-reserves-arent-really-money-the-world-is-in-for-a-shock-11646311306">piece</a> in the Wall Street Journal titled &#8220;<em>If Russian Currency Reserves Aren&#8217;t Really Money, the World Is in for a Shock,&#8221;</em> reporter Jon Sindreu had this to say about how central banks everywhere must now view their reserves:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>Many economists have long equated this money to savings in a piggy bank, which in turn correspond to investments made abroad in the real economy. Recent events highlight the error in this thinking: Barring gold, <strong>these assets are someone else&#8217;s liability&#8212;someone who can just decide they are worth nothing</strong>. Last year, the IMF suspended Taliban-controlled Afghanistan&#8217;s access to funds and SDR. Sanctions on Iran have confirmed that holding reserves offshore doesn&#8217;t stop the U.S. Treasury from taking action. As New England Law Professor Christine Abely points out, the 2017 settlement with Singapore&#8217;s CSE TransTel shows that <strong>the mere use of the dollar abroad can violate sanctions on the premise that some payment clearing ultimately happens on U.S. soil.</strong></em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6833f375-0f23-46df-93b7-9c703c349950_880x587.jpeg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6833f375-0f23-46df-93b7-9c703c349950_880x587.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6833f375-0f23-46df-93b7-9c703c349950_880x587.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6833f375-0f23-46df-93b7-9c703c349950_880x587.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6833f375-0f23-46df-93b7-9c703c349950_880x587.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6833f375-0f23-46df-93b7-9c703c349950_880x587.jpeg" width="880" height="587" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6833f375-0f23-46df-93b7-9c703c349950_880x587.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:587,&quot;width&quot;:880,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:84820,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6833f375-0f23-46df-93b7-9c703c349950_880x587.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6833f375-0f23-46df-93b7-9c703c349950_880x587.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6833f375-0f23-46df-93b7-9c703c349950_880x587.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6833f375-0f23-46df-93b7-9c703c349950_880x587.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Photo credit: Bloomberg</figcaption></figure></div><p>In for a shock, indeed. In essence, Sindreu&#8217;s piece argues that this move substantially increases the risk that the US dollar loses its privileged status as the global reserve currency and, at a minimum, likely ensures a polarization of the global economy into at least two camps &#8211; the West in one and Russia/China/Iran/Saudi Arabia plus other targeted or aligned countries in the other. If $20-30 trillion or more of global GDP spurns the preexisting reserve currency, is it still the reserve currency? If reserves can be negated overnight, are they even reserves? How many other countries must hedge against the possibility of similar sanctions? Should we add India to <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/international/596693-biden-weighing-sanctions-on-india-over-russian-military-stockpiles">the list</a>?</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>The Biden administration is weighing whether to impose sanctions against India over its stockpile of and reliance on Russian military equipment as part of&nbsp;the wide-ranging consequences the West is seeking to impose on&nbsp;Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Donald Lu, the assistant secretary of State for South Asian affairs, on Thursday told lawmakers in a hearing that the administration is weighing how threatening India's historically close military relationship with Russia is to U.S. security</em>.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Another eyebrow-raising development is the US Department of Justice&#8217;s establishment of the ominously-named Task Force KleptoCapture, which has the stated intent of <em><strong>seizing</strong></em> (not freezing) the assets of Russian oligarchs. Here&#8217;s how the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/us/politics/russian-oligarchs-justice-department.html">describes</a> it:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>The creation of the task force reflects the harsh scrutiny cast on Russian oligarchs, many of whom built their fortunes because of their ties to Mr. Putin. <strong>Even though they may not be directly involved in Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, they enable Mr. Putin</strong> by helping him conceal his own assets and remain in power.</em></p><p><em>Russia&#8217;s oligarchs have <strong>invested their fortunes in assets around the world</strong>, and their ties to Mr. Putin have helped them gain influence and connections in the worlds of fine art, real estate, Wall Street and Silicon Valley.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2189632-8a0c-4862-a155-aae25ebe6eb5_860x485.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2189632-8a0c-4862-a155-aae25ebe6eb5_860x485.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2189632-8a0c-4862-a155-aae25ebe6eb5_860x485.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2189632-8a0c-4862-a155-aae25ebe6eb5_860x485.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2189632-8a0c-4862-a155-aae25ebe6eb5_860x485.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2189632-8a0c-4862-a155-aae25ebe6eb5_860x485.png" width="860" height="485" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e2189632-8a0c-4862-a155-aae25ebe6eb5_860x485.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:485,&quot;width&quot;:860,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:496622,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2189632-8a0c-4862-a155-aae25ebe6eb5_860x485.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2189632-8a0c-4862-a155-aae25ebe6eb5_860x485.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2189632-8a0c-4862-a155-aae25ebe6eb5_860x485.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2189632-8a0c-4862-a155-aae25ebe6eb5_860x485.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Oligarch&#8217;s not-yacht | photo credit: Forbes</figcaption></figure></div><p>We are the first to admit that &#8220;Russian oligarch&#8221; is a less sympathetic faction than &#8220;<a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/just-watch-me?s=w">Canadian trucker</a>,&#8221; and perpetrating a war on another sovereign nation is way more serious than honking horns in downtown Ottawa, but many of the same questions we raised about the consequences of Justin Trudeau&#8217;s impulses seem apropos here. Who gets to define oligarch? What qualifies as enabling? Do the accused have any recourse? If assets in the West are subject to swift confiscation without due process for even <em><strong>indirectly</strong></em> enabling a currently unpopular-with-us national political leader &#8211; no matter how justified that unpopularity might be &#8211; what sane foreign asset owner wouldn&#8217;t at least consider liquidating assets <em><strong>now</strong></em> and onshoring what wealth they can preserve? Have we thought through the dominos that fall by fundamentally rewriting property laws?</p><p>Further down in the same New York Times article, we find another interesting passage. We&#8217;ve long argued that a crackdown on cryptocurrencies is imminent. Will the US use the Russian invasion of Ukraine as a pretext for doing so? It sure seems like it:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em><strong>The task force will target people and companies that</strong> are trying to evade anti-money laundering laws, hide their identities from financial institutions and <strong>use cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions and launder money</strong>. The Justice Department said that it would use civil and criminal asset forfeiture to seize assets belonging to people subject to sanctions.</em></p><p><em>The department said that its work would complement that of a trans-Atlantic task force announced this past weekend to identify and seize the assets of <strong>penalized Russian individuals</strong> and companies around the world.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Yet another meaningful development is the move by multinational corporations to self-sanction <em><strong>all aspects</strong></em> of their business activity tied to Russia, undoubtedly motivated by the disturbing images coming out of Ukraine and pressured by their stakeholders to do something about it. This is not the first time corporations have been called to action after certain political events &#8211; Western governments have a long history of trying to implement controversial policies by leaning on business leaders to do their dirty work for them &#8211; but these recent developments likely cause concern even among Western leaders. Perhaps na&#239;vely, the US and its NATO allies specifically tried to carve out Russian oil and gas from the reach of sanctions, recognizing our critical need for these essential supplies (a weakness we&#8217;ve been <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/have-fun-staying-cold?s=w">writing about</a> for many months). But as the Financial Times <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cecebc90-5f99-4b4a-9770-5487bbd1c63a">describes</a> in a recent report, if the zeitgeist uniformly labels an entity toxic &#8211; even an entire G20 country &#8211; there can be no carve-outs:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>In reality, however, many western banks, refineries and shipowners are in effect &#8216;self-sanctioning&#8217; &#8212; behaving as if Russian oil has already been placed under sanctions. &#8216;<strong>Russia&#8217;s oil has effectively become toxic</strong>,&#8217; said one banker.</em></p><p><em>Some of the biggest buyers of Russian crude have cancelled shipments and orders as companies from banks to insurers and shippers retreat from Russian business.</em></p><p><em><strong>Roughly 70 per cent of Russian crude was &#8216;struggling to find buyers,&#8217; according to consultancy Energy Aspects</strong>. As proof, Russia&#8217;s flagship Urals crude, a staple for refiners in north-west Europe and the Mediterranean, was quoted at a record discount of more than $18 a barrel on Wednesday.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Here are just some of the potentially catastrophic economic consequences to ponder if these events continue to snowball down a steepening slope. The obvious place to start is in the energy sector, where European natural gas prices have been trading like a crypto scam coin, rising and plunging by unthinkable amounts on a daily basis. The economic impact of both the elevated price <em><strong>and </strong></em>the volatility of energy on Europe&#8217;s manufacturing sector will be revealed in the coming weeks and months &#8211; we suspect the results will stun many.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda6ca247-b4e2-44c3-b13f-a80fde429c34_2876x1452.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda6ca247-b4e2-44c3-b13f-a80fde429c34_2876x1452.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda6ca247-b4e2-44c3-b13f-a80fde429c34_2876x1452.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda6ca247-b4e2-44c3-b13f-a80fde429c34_2876x1452.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda6ca247-b4e2-44c3-b13f-a80fde429c34_2876x1452.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda6ca247-b4e2-44c3-b13f-a80fde429c34_2876x1452.png" width="1456" height="735" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/da6ca247-b4e2-44c3-b13f-a80fde429c34_2876x1452.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:735,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:762936,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda6ca247-b4e2-44c3-b13f-a80fde429c34_2876x1452.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda6ca247-b4e2-44c3-b13f-a80fde429c34_2876x1452.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda6ca247-b4e2-44c3-b13f-a80fde429c34_2876x1452.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda6ca247-b4e2-44c3-b13f-a80fde429c34_2876x1452.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a></figure></div><p>Similarly, Russia and Ukraine are among the most prolific producers and exporters of critical foodstuffs in the world, and prices of agricultural goods are flashing red. In a piece we wrote all the way back in October of last year called <em><a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/starvation-diet?s=w">Starvation Diet</a></em>, we predicted a global mass starvation event was nearly inevitable, and that was <em><strong>before</strong></em> war broke out in Ukraine. Here&#8217;s how the piece opened:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>We are on the cusp of a significant mass starvation event of our own making. Soon, tens of millions of the world&#8217;s most impoverished people will die from an inability to feed themselves, while many of those comfortably getting by now &#8211; especially in the Western World &#8211; are in for a shock.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Unsurprisingly, wheat has traded limit up for several days in a row and prices are reaching levels that condemn vast swaths of the global population to the fate we reluctantly described above. Food inflation is the catalyst for many popular uprisings, and the path from empty shelves to the guillotine has historically been a direct one. Now consider further that the West has outsourced the production of energy and critical mining materials to impoverished countries.

Fresh off a chemistry degree and working a good finance job in the City of London, Thompson was on the path to what most of us would consider success. Steady pay, upward mobility, respectable work &#8211; the kind of stuff that can be easily explained to relatives and high school friends at holiday gatherings. If she kept following the path she was on, she might have even ended up rich.</p><p>There was only one small problem. Thompson wasn&#8217;t doing what she was meant to be doing.</p><p>In early 2020, a mere month before Covid hit, Thompson quit her job to launch The Fabled Thread, a business spun from the lost art of embroidery. With a brand that radiates whimsy, color, warmth, and craftsmanship, Thompson is reinvigorating the art of needlework for a new generation, embracing them with a warm welcome into her community of creativity.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F181c2945-56ca-421c-ad29-85198e9a9690_2500x1667.jpeg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F181c2945-56ca-421c-ad29-85198e9a9690_2500x1667.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F181c2945-56ca-421c-ad29-85198e9a9690_2500x1667.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F181c2945-56ca-421c-ad29-85198e9a9690_2500x1667.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F181c2945-56ca-421c-ad29-85198e9a9690_2500x1667.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F181c2945-56ca-421c-ad29-85198e9a9690_2500x1667.jpeg" width="1456" height="971" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/181c2945-56ca-421c-ad29-85198e9a9690_2500x1667.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1380608,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F181c2945-56ca-421c-ad29-85198e9a9690_2500x1667.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F181c2945-56ca-421c-ad29-85198e9a9690_2500x1667.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F181c2945-56ca-421c-ad29-85198e9a9690_2500x1667.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F181c2945-56ca-421c-ad29-85198e9a9690_2500x1667.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Eppie Thompson in her home | photo via The Fabled Thread</figcaption></figure></div><p>At first blush, you might think that profiling someone passionate about sewing for this month&#8217;s edition of <em>The Work of My Life</em> is a deep cut for the <em>Doomberg</em> team, but Thompson is at her very core an outstanding content creator. We admire her art, work ethic, spirit, and gumption. Arriving at her beautifully designed <a href="https://thefabledthread.com/">website</a>, one is greeted with the following message:</p><p>&#8220;<em>I'm Eppie Thompson. I've fallen in love with the pleasures of sewing and I'd love to help you do the same.</em>&#8221;</p><p>Thompson launched the business from her East London flat and enjoyed enough early success that she moved into a dedicated studio within a year. A further year on, and she just expanded into yet another studio three times the size of the first. Business is booming. Thompson sells embroidery kits, filling a market niche she identified when she embarked on her own journey of connecting with the art. Every collection that The Fabled Thread offers is attentively designed &#8220;<em><strong>to make each kit</strong> <strong>feel like a real treat for the maker</strong></em>,&#8221; including effective video tutorials, thoughtfully sourced high-quality materials, and substantial packaging that feels like a gift unto itself.</p><p>And therein lies the magic in her inevitable success. Thompson is both pursuing her passion and focusing on how her products make her customers <em><strong>feel</strong></em>, which, as we&#8217;ve written <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/the-riches-are-in-the-niches?utm_source=url">previously</a>, is the ultimate expression of a winning brand. Her business has expanded into framing, sewing supplies, and highly sought-after in-person workshops where Thompson authentically evangelizes the healing, nourishing lift that making art with your own hands gives to the soul.</p><p>But the true vindication of Thompson&#8217;s decision to free herself from the tortuous shackles of a good job can be found by following her progress on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thefabledthread/?hl=en">Instagram</a>, where she unselfconsciously chronicles the journey for all her supporters to observe. Especially touching is the series of Instagram Stories labeled &#8220;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18178412395161564/">Studio II</a>,&#8221; where Thompson documents the essential role her father plays in converting her new studio into a functioning factory. After a long first day of moving and construction, the pair break out into a joyous and spontaneous dance, with her father using the end of a Shop-Vac hose as a makeshift microphone. May every parent reading this be as rich as Rollo Thompson.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F393fdb09-b3ba-4652-a049-7ea74d77345a_798x467.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F393fdb09-b3ba-4652-a049-7ea74d77345a_798x467.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F393fdb09-b3ba-4652-a049-7ea74d77345a_798x467.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F393fdb09-b3ba-4652-a049-7ea74d77345a_798x467.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F393fdb09-b3ba-4652-a049-7ea74d77345a_798x467.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F393fdb09-b3ba-4652-a049-7ea74d77345a_798x467.png" width="798" height="467" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/393fdb09-b3ba-4652-a049-7ea74d77345a_798x467.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:467,&quot;width&quot;:798,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:556447,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F393fdb09-b3ba-4652-a049-7ea74d77345a_798x467.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F393fdb09-b3ba-4652-a049-7ea74d77345a_798x467.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F393fdb09-b3ba-4652-a049-7ea74d77345a_798x467.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F393fdb09-b3ba-4652-a049-7ea74d77345a_798x467.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a></figure></div><p>As longtime readers of <em>Doomberg </em>know, we have openly shared our progress in these monthly <em>Work of My Life</em> pieces.

In <em>Putin&#8217;s Fool Rush In</em>, a <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/putins-fools-rush-in?utm_source=url">piece</a> we wrote last October, we correctly assessed the dangers of Europe&#8217;s energy strategy but incorrectly predicted the outcome. We assumed Germany would be forced to give the Nord Stream 2 pipeline full and final approval, handing Putin a clear geopolitical victory. Instead, Germany shelved the project and now we have war. Getting into the head of a dictator is tough, and only Putin knows why he went all-in on Thursday, but he clearly believes his hand is strong enough for such drastic measures. We closed the piece as follows (emphasis added throughout):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>Energy is life. Those projects will get developed. The geopolitical power vacuum we are creating will get filled. <strong>We might not be serious, but our enemies are ruthlessly so</strong>. They raise a toast to our self-inflicted demise.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Until Putin officially ordered his troops into Ukraine, we strongly doubted an attack would come despite the ever-increasing and specific warnings from the US intelligence community. We were wrong. One basis for our skepticism was a report that hit <em>Bloomberg</em> on February 22, 2022, a mere 48 hours before the conflict began:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em><strong>The Biden administration has delayed issuing permits for new oil and gas drilling on federal land</strong>, a move that could complicate efforts to tame gasoline prices that are poised to top $4 per gallon amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict.</em></p><p><em><strong>The Interior Department warned of delays in new drilling permits</strong> after a Louisiana-based federal district judge blocked the administration&#8217;s method for assessing how its permit approvals affect climate change.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>We could never have imagined a scenario in which the US would <em><strong>continue</strong></em> to impede domestic development of critical energy projects on the eve of the most serious conflict in Europe since the end of World War II. But here we are. Energy is at the core of our flexibility to respond in a meaningful manner. Reports out of Europe indicate significant division among NATO allies as to the severity of the sanctions that should be imposed on Putin. No wonder. Here&#8217;s a summarized series of headlines that crossed the wires shortly after hostilities broke out:</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/antoguerrera/status/1496848585882746881?s=20&amp;t=uUa06kCKllRKv5ykDos0iQ&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;GERMAN ECONOMY MINISTER HABECK SAYS 50% OF OUR COAL COMES FROM RUSSIA\n\nGERMAN ECONOMY MINISTER HABECK SAYS 55% OF OUR GAS FROM RUSSIA\n\nGERMAN ECONOMY MINISTER HABECK SAYS 35% OF OUR OIL COMES FROM RUSSIA\n\nReuters - <span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>#Ukraine</span>&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;antoguerrera&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Antonello Guerrera&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Thu Feb 24 14:04:47 +0000 2022&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:2025,&quot;like_count&quot;:7039,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null}"><a href="https://twitter.com/antoguerrera/status/1496848585882746881?s=20&amp;t=uUa06kCKllRKv5ykDos0iQ" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-user-avatar" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/twitter_name/w_36/antoguerrera.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @antoguerrera"><span class="tweet-author-name">Antonello Guerrera </span><span class="tweet-author">@antoguerrera</span></div>GERMAN ECONOMY MINISTER HABECK SAYS 50% OF OUR COAL COMES FROM RUSSIA

Frank McNamara was entertaining clients at Majors Cabin Grill restaurant in New York when he realized he left his wallet in a different suit. For our younger readers, a suit was a uniform men wore to project importance and, in this context, a wallet was a physical thing that carried important paper. Luckily for McNamara, his wife swung by the restaurant to pay his tab, but history was forever changed by that bit of forgetfulness.</p><p>Motivated by the embarrassing episode, McNamara and his partners co-founded Diners Club and launched the world&#8217;s first multipurpose charge card. In February of 1950, he returned to the same restaurant and became the first person to pay for a meal using a &#8220;credit identification card,&#8221; and the rest is history. According to data compiled by <em>Statista</em>, there are an estimated 725 million Visa, Mastercard, and American Express cards in circulation today in the US alone &#8211; almost four for every adult.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76dac33e-38f5-4cfc-9401-d8dc745e803e_900x600.jpeg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76dac33e-38f5-4cfc-9401-d8dc745e803e_900x600.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76dac33e-38f5-4cfc-9401-d8dc745e803e_900x600.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76dac33e-38f5-4cfc-9401-d8dc745e803e_900x600.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76dac33e-38f5-4cfc-9401-d8dc745e803e_900x600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76dac33e-38f5-4cfc-9401-d8dc745e803e_900x600.jpeg" width="900" height="600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/76dac33e-38f5-4cfc-9401-d8dc745e803e_900x600.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:600,&quot;width&quot;:900,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:268169,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76dac33e-38f5-4cfc-9401-d8dc745e803e_900x600.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76dac33e-38f5-4cfc-9401-d8dc745e803e_900x600.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76dac33e-38f5-4cfc-9401-d8dc745e803e_900x600.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76dac33e-38f5-4cfc-9401-d8dc745e803e_900x600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a><figcaption class="image-caption">An early Diners Club card | photo credit: dinersclub.com</figcaption></figure></div><p>With the proliferation of credit cards and other forms of digital payment, consumers have slowly lost their visceral connection with money. A classic recommendation of budgeting gurus &#8211; one that now seems as outmoded as the answering machine &#8211; is to only pay for things using physical cash, since it somehow feels more real to part with four $20 bills from your purse or wallet than it does to swipe a credit card or tap your phone for an $80 purchase. Nowadays, such a recommendation would be virtually impossible to implement. The practicality of both accessing <em><strong>and</strong></em> using physical cash in our society is becoming increasingly difficult and rife with stigma.</p><p>The standard definition of money is any item or verifiable record that can function as a store of value, a unit of account, and a medium of exchange. When Richard Nixon took the US dollar off the gold standard in 1971, many were concerned the move would greatly diminish its function as a store of value. Judging by the debasement of the dollar&#8217;s purchasing power in the intervening 50 years, those concerns were well-founded.</p><p>Until recently, the dollar&#8217;s durability as a medium of exchange was never in doubt. Every piece of <em><strong>physical</strong></em> US currency was (and still is) adorned with the phrase &#8220;THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER FOR <em><strong>ALL DEBTS, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE</strong></em>.&#8221;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F679328bc-4c74-41ae-8e1a-ab85fa4239e6_1216x519.jpeg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F679328bc-4c74-41ae-8e1a-ab85fa4239e6_1216x519.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F679328bc-4c74-41ae-8e1a-ab85fa4239e6_1216x519.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F679328bc-4c74-41ae-8e1a-ab85fa4239e6_1216x519.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F679328bc-4c74-41ae-8e1a-ab85fa4239e6_1216x519.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F679328bc-4c74-41ae-8e1a-ab85fa4239e6_1216x519.jpeg" width="1216" height="519" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/679328bc-4c74-41ae-8e1a-ab85fa4239e6_1216x519.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:519,&quot;width&quot;:1216,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:358110,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F679328bc-4c74-41ae-8e1a-ab85fa4239e6_1216x519.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F679328bc-4c74-41ae-8e1a-ab85fa4239e6_1216x519.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F679328bc-4c74-41ae-8e1a-ab85fa4239e6_1216x519.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F679328bc-4c74-41ae-8e1a-ab85fa4239e6_1216x519.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a></figure></div><p>The digitization of currency ties each individual directly &#8211; transparently &#8211; to their money and empowers the state with decision power on whether any particular citizen is <em><strong>allowed to transact</strong></em> in modern society. Your money no longer represents stored wealth that can be exchanged for goods and services. Rather, it represents stored wealth that can be exchanged for goods and services as permitted by the state. Mostly gone is the anonymity that comes with transacting in physical cash &#8211; the ultimate manifestation of a decentralized currency. (Just try booking a hotel room with nothing but cash and a valid passport.) In its place we find myriad extrajudicial procedures and complex regulations that strip away our freedoms and, if left unchecked, will ultimately make way for the displacement of our representative democracies with totalitarian states.</p><p>In a staggering 56-part Twitter thread that recently went viral, an anonymous account by the name of @punk6529 drives home this point brilliantly. A link to the full thread is <a href="https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1494444624630403083?s=20&amp;t=aGXN2iXRA2YK4QwgljF43w">here</a>. The core thesis is that one cannot have freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, or freedom of religion without the freedom to transact. Robbing a citizen of his or her ability to transact is a devastating punishment, and for the government to claim it has<em><strong> the ability to do so without judicial review or any reasonable recourse</strong></em> is the functional equivalent of totalitarianism. The 18th and 19th tweets in the thread are particularly compelling:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F536618c7-177a-4139-99cd-48f8f740efbc_1232x744.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F536618c7-177a-4139-99cd-48f8f740efbc_1232x744.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F536618c7-177a-4139-99cd-48f8f740efbc_1232x744.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F536618c7-177a-4139-99cd-48f8f740efbc_1232x744.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F536618c7-177a-4139-99cd-48f8f740efbc_1232x744.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F536618c7-177a-4139-99cd-48f8f740efbc_1232x744.png" width="580" height="350.2597402597403" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/536618c7-177a-4139-99cd-48f8f740efbc_1232x744.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:744,&quot;width&quot;:1232,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:580,&quot;bytes&quot;:474146,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F536618c7-177a-4139-99cd-48f8f740efbc_1232x744.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F536618c7-177a-4139-99cd-48f8f740efbc_1232x744.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F536618c7-177a-4139-99cd-48f8f740efbc_1232x744.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F536618c7-177a-4139-99cd-48f8f740efbc_1232x744.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a></figure></div><p>As we described in our last <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/just-watch-me?utm_source=url">piece</a>, Justin Trudeau has crossed the Rubicon in this regard, and if his actions become normalized, the entire edifice of Western democracy will undoubtedly collapse. Lest our readers think this is hyperbole or that Trudeau&#8217;s behavior will be contained to Canada, we point you to an excellent piece called <em>In Praise of Bitcoin</em> written by Dr. Ben Hunt (the article can be found <a href="https://www.epsilontheory.com/in-praise-of-bitcoin/">here</a>, and you can follow Hunt&#8217;s Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/EpsilonTheory">here</a>). In it, Hunt correctly likens the US Treasury to the Eye of Sauron. Here&#8217;s a critical passage (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>If there&#8217;s a Western governmental institution that is more <strong>unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality than the US Treasury</strong>, I am unaware of what that institution might be. But unlike Wall Street, which is motivated by Flow, the US Treasury has an entirely different (but highly compatible!) goal.</em></p><p><em><strong>The goal of the US Treasury is to see all of the money in the world.</strong></em></p><p><em>That&#8217;s really all it is. That&#8217;s what Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations are all about. That&#8217;s what Know Your Client (KYC) regulations are all about. That&#8217;s what Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) regulations are all about. That&#8217;s what the Treasury-led Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) is all about. That&#8217;s what the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) is all about. None of these programs are really about taxes. None of these programs are really about catching crooks or fighting terrorists. <strong>All of these programs are really about information for information&#8217;s sake regarding the greatest source of power in the world and the raison d&#8217;etre of every government on Earth: money.</strong></em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>It is through a related lens that we have written skeptically about crypto in the past. We&#8217;ve marveled as <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/the-dojs-crypto-dragnet-is-bigger?utm_source=url">US regulators</a> allowed the crypto ecosystem to evolve, warned crypto participants that a crackdown is <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/the-sec-crackdown-on-defi-is-imminent?utm_source=url">inevitable</a>, and questioned how the &#8220;value&#8221; of one&#8217;s crypto holdings could be effectively transmitted back to the <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/dollars-ex-machina?utm_source=url">fiat world</a>. Many have filled our Twitter feed and Substack comments section expressing the view that Trudeau&#8217;s descent into totalitarianism validates the need for cryptocurrencies. While we don&#8217;t doubt the demand for such exposure will increase because of his actions, we draw a more sobering conclusion. Trudeau&#8217;s actions destroy the concept that cryptocurrencies will <em><strong>ever</strong></em> be an effective medium of exchange. We recently summarized this view on Twitter:</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/DoombergT/status/1493802253643579392?s=20&amp;t=U8wWTL4gGilo-9JTws4npw&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;The answer to government weaponization of the financial system isn&#8217;t a new financial system.

Your bank accounts have been frozen, credit cards canceled, and access to your brokerage account denied. Further, imagine you have accumulated some Bitcoin in a cold storage wallet (i.e., on a flash drive in your possession), carefully ensuring that it is outside Trudeau&#8217;s reach. How are you going to pay your mortgage, car payment, tuition expenses, or buy groceries with it? The answer is you can&#8217;t. Does that wallet represent a store of value that might be reactivated in the future should the government change its stance towards you, or is itself changed altogether? Absolutely. Does it represent a practical medium of exchange, one that is useful during this personal crisis? Absolutely not.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://doomberg.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Doomberg subscribers cherish their freedom.

If they can&#8217;t be used to transact in the main, they&#8217;re just bits of data on a flash drive. Crypto proponents will argue that off-exchange peer-to-peer transfers are still possible and this enables bartering, or that you could move to a country that more widely accepts cryptocurrencies as payment. To these critics, we say thank you for highlighting the exceptions that prove our thesis. If that is all you have left, it is clear how much the government has taken away from you and how feeble cryptocurrencies are as a hedge.

During one of those stints, Reid converted to Islam and eventually became radicalized. His path from prison to that fateful flight included visits to terrorist training camps in Pakistan and Afghanistan, which one assumes should have grabbed the attention of the intelligence agencies. It also included an attempt to fly the same route on the <em><strong>previous day</strong></em> when his disheveled appearance, lack of check-on luggage, and evasive answers to questions from airport officials caused him to be denied permission to board.</p><p>That Reid was allowed to board an international flight the very next day &#8211; and so shortly after the 9/11 attacks &#8211; was an intelligence failure, but the reaction to Reid&#8217;s attempt at terrorism had little to do with problem-solving. Five years later, after a new, unverified threat of a different shoe bomber, the US Transportation Security Administration (TSA) mandated all passengers remove their footwear for screening, despite knowing that the machines used to screen carry-on luggage are <em><strong>incapable</strong></em> of detecting these types of explosives. If you doubt the futility of these choreographed acts of security theater, <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/12/20/whistleblower-says-tsa-is-trading-speed-for-security/">consider</a> that nearly a decade after the &#8220;shoes off&#8221; rule took effect, TSA officers weren&#8217;t even able to detect fake <em><strong>weapons</strong></em> with any semblance of consistency (emphasis added throughout this piece):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>In 2015, agents with Department of Homeland Security posing as passengers snuck fake explosives through the security lines of several of the nation&#8217;s busiest airports. During the test, <strong>TSA officers missed 67 of the 70 fake weapons that went through the checks &#8212; a failure rate of 95%.</strong></em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>While the inconvenience of complying with this rule is admittedly modest, it serves as an underappreciated signpost of the direction we in the West are traveling. By our estimation, people in the US have removed their shoes at least <em><strong>10 billion times</strong></em> since 2006, yet the number of <em><strong>verifiable</strong></em> instances of Richard Reid copycats still stands at zero. The proliferation of laws and organizations, like the TSA, was born of the fallout from the 9/11 attacks. There is a direct line from that series of events to what we see today. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8641255d-b6ad-476e-b2bb-ea87ea047732_1280x720.jpeg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8641255d-b6ad-476e-b2bb-ea87ea047732_1280x720.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8641255d-b6ad-476e-b2bb-ea87ea047732_1280x720.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8641255d-b6ad-476e-b2bb-ea87ea047732_1280x720.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8641255d-b6ad-476e-b2bb-ea87ea047732_1280x720.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8641255d-b6ad-476e-b2bb-ea87ea047732_1280x720.jpeg" width="1280" height="720" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8641255d-b6ad-476e-b2bb-ea87ea047732_1280x720.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:720,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:102783,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8641255d-b6ad-476e-b2bb-ea87ea047732_1280x720.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8641255d-b6ad-476e-b2bb-ea87ea047732_1280x720.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8641255d-b6ad-476e-b2bb-ea87ea047732_1280x720.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8641255d-b6ad-476e-b2bb-ea87ea047732_1280x720.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a></figure></div><p>To wit, four observations:</p><p>First, as a society, we are incapable of making reasonable tradeoffs when it comes to risk, especially when such risks are front-page news. The only new threat to our way of life that was exploited by the 9/11 attackers was the use of planes <em><strong>as weapons</strong></em> &#8211; hijackings and bombings were rare but well-known risks prior to that terrible day &#8211; and fortifying cockpit doors and increasing background checks on pilots were always the most direct and sensible responses. We didn&#8217;t stop there, of course. Instead, <em><strong>all risk</strong></em> to planes worldwide had to be driven to <em><strong>zero</strong></em> regardless of the impact on people&#8217;s time or freedom. Zero is an emotional number and an impossible task, but a remarkably effective target when garnering public support for compliance.</p><p>Second, fear is a powerful tool of propaganda. A surprisingly high number of people are willing to forgo even basic rights in exchange for perceived protection from the state, no matter how small the increment of protection is on offer. The US Patriot Act is an Orwellian nightmare of government-approved intrusion, bureaucracy, and infringement on basic rights. Just consider the full name of the legislation: <em>Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001</em>. Nothing good comes out of legislation with a name like that, and the definition of &#8220;terrorism&#8221; has continued to evolve to the point where it basically means &#8220;opposed to the policies of those currently in power.&#8221; Here&#8217;s how the American Civil Liberties Union <a href="https://www.aclu.org/other/surveillance-under-usapatriot-act">describes</a> the law:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>The result is <strong>unchecked government power</strong> to rifle through individuals' financial records, medical histories, Internet usage, bookstore purchases, library usage, travel patterns, or any other activity that leaves a record.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Not only are government agencies collecting and evaluating information on each one of us, they are also not required to justify the purpose of such reviews with any specificity. As the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board clarified in a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/congress-cia-ron-wyden-martin-heinrich-europe-565878d7299748551a34af0d3543d769">report made public last week</a> of the CIA&#8217;s covert data collection practices against Americans, &#8220;&#8230;analysts are not required to memorialize the justification for their queries.&#8221;</p><p>Third, like the arrow of time itself, encroachments on our freedom are unidirectional &#8211; they only ever get worse. Want to avoid taking off your shoes at the airport? Apply for TSA PreCheck and become a Trusted Traveler&#8482;, as though being an American citizen without a criminal record isn&#8217;t trustworthy enough. TSA PreCheck line too crowded? Give your retinal scan to CLEAR, a private company authorized by the <em>Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies (SAFETY) Act</em>. And on it goes. While each increment of nuisance or invasion of privacy doesn&#8217;t feel like the end of the world in the moment, integrated over time, society becomes unrecognizable to what it was just years earlier.</p><p>Fourth, the effort to demonize those raising a skeptical eyebrow to such measures is a startlingly easy lift. The all-in-it-together mantra flows coast-to-coast and the questioning voice is comfortably labeled that of a sympathizer. As US readers may recall, to criticize the Patriot Act was to defile the memory of every lost FDNY hero.</p><p>In Episode 209 of Demetri Kofinas&#8217; excellent <a href="hiddenforces.io">podcast</a> <em>Hidden Forces</em>, he interviews Simon Mikhailovich, who escaped Soviet rule and immigrated to America in the 1970s. On the show, Mikhailovich delivers a powerful message about the disturbing trend he sees in the financial and political arenas of the Western world. Here&#8217;s an excerpt from the most impactful segment of the recording:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>But after the 2000 crisis and <strong>then 2001 Patriot Act where I felt that America has taken a sharp turn into a different direction</strong>. Where everything that I thought or took for granted in this new country for me, which is basically anything that's not expressly forbidden is allowed&#8230;</em></p><p><em>I can't impart it to anybody who hasn't been there. <strong>Standing in the security line in the airport. If you want to know what it's like to be in the Soviet Union, you are in the Soviet Union.</strong> In that moment, you are in the Soviet Union, you're in a line waiting for something. And at the end of that line, a lot of bad things can happen to you. People don't think that way. But in reality though...</em></p><p><em>I remember when people like Naomi Wolf announced that she had been put on a blacklist, on a no-fly list. Remember these lists? These were new to the American experience. Thousands of people ending up on these lists, having no idea how they got on, but more importantly, <strong>having no idea how to get off</strong>. You think it's hard to contact Google, like imagine trying to contact the government and not being able to find anybody to explain to you how you got there. And you're on it, you're on it for life.</em></p><p><em>So, when I stand in that line, I'm not on that list, thank God and I hope I won't be. <strong>But I feel it very much at a visceral level because I understand how these types of population control measures evolve in the hands of governments and bureaucrats.</strong> And so, to me, it's not benign in any way, shape, or form, but to most people it's just like Pastor Niem&#246;ller in Nazi Germany. He said, when they first came for the socialists, &#8216;I didn't say anything because I wasn't a socialist.&#8217; And then they came for the communists, &#8230; and &#8216;I wasn't a communist&#8217;" They came for the Jews and &#8216;I wasn't a Jew.&#8217; So that's what happens. People on this list is not you. And therefore, you feel like it's not about you <strong>until it is about you.</strong></em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>For many people, dealing with the restrictions imposed on them, their children, and their businesses because of our political response to Covid-19 <em><strong>has</strong></em> made it about them. It is at the heart of the Freedom Convoy in Canada and is why we have spent so much time on Twitter commenting on the stunning events unfolding under (current) Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&#8217;s watch.</p><p>At a time when the severity of the virus is waning and many countries are finally pulling back from what history will undoubtedly judge to be ineffective, unscientific, and likely scandalous countermeasures, Trudeau doubled down, knowingly picking a fight with Canadian truckers over vaccine mandates. We won&#8217;t rehash the arguments and facts here as the details are widely known. Instead, we focus on the complete collapse of Trudeau&#8217;s leadership tactics, beginning with his now infamous framing of the onslaught that was headed his way:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>The small fringe minority of people who are on their way to Ottawa<strong>, who are holding unacceptable views</strong> that they are expressing, do not represent the views of Canadians&#8230;who know that following the science and stepping up to protect each other is <strong>the best way to ensure our rights, our freedoms, our values as a country</strong>.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>By positioning the protestors as &#8220;those who <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/547876-trudeau-truckers-canada-racist/">fly racist flags</a>&#8221; &#8211; as a fringe minority with unacceptable views &#8211; Trudeau committed a fatal error: <em><strong>he left himself no face-saving exit</strong></em> from the imminent and predictable crisis that would befall him. No respectable politician can strike a deal with such undesirables after libeling them in the way that he did. The only path left was to crush them.</p><p>Amateur hour, indeed.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://doomberg.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Sign up to receive all of Doomberg&#8217;s fringe, unacceptable views direct to your inbox!</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email&#8230;" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p>Further, by positioning the rights, freedoms, and values of his <em><strong>fellow citizens</strong></em> as something that needed <em><strong>his</strong></em> blessing to &#8220;ensure&#8221; &#8211; as opposed to being inalienable rights possessed by Canadians and protected by the Canadian Bill of Rights &#8211; Trudeau reinforced what many have come to suspect about him.

Even though significant border protests were either already cleared (in Windsor, Ontario) or the cusp of ending (in Coutts, Alberta), Trudeau invoked the Canadian equivalent of martial law, granting himself virtually unlimited power to trample on the rights of any citizen that dares protest his policies.

Even if you think the Freedom Convey protestors <em><strong>are</strong></em> racist Nazis with unacceptable views, if you can&#8217;t see how dangerous this overreach is and how short the path is from &#8220;them&#8221; to &#8220;you,&#8221; we submit that you are catastrophically naive. By granting himself the discretion to freeze the <em><strong>banking privileges of</strong></em> <em><strong>citizens without a court order or judicial review</strong></em> based on nothing more than a politician&#8217;s nebulous definition of &#8220;involved,&#8221; Trudeau has indeed gone full dictator.</p><p>And so, another advance of the conveyor into the abyss is clicked into place. By broadening the scope of Canada's anti-money laundering and <em><strong>terrorist </strong></em>financing rules to include crowdfunding platforms and cryptocurrencies that support peaceful protestors, Trudeau and his cabinet of wannabe totalitarians have validated the concerns of every conscientious objector to the post 9/11 laws that were so hurriedly passed with precious little debate.

Without getting too technical, lanthanides have unpaired electrons in their ground state configurations making them excellent candidates for use as magnets in anything with an electric motor. As efforts are made to move away from fossil fuels and to decarbonize our energy sector, the efficiency of electric motors in converting electricity to useful work becomes supremely attractive. Magnets are at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWulQ1ZSE3c">core of electric motor technology</a>. There aren&#8217;t many scenarios in which our future work won&#8217;t be strongly dependent on motors, and therefore magnets, and therefore lanthanides. There are few viable alternatives.</p><p>And therein lies the rub: everybody wants them but getting them is tough.</p><p>Lanthanides form the bulk of what are colloquially known as the rare earth elements, although they aren&#8217;t all that rare. Rather, they are assigned that descriptor because economically feasible deposits of lanthanides are difficult to come by &#8211; when the elements are discovered in high enough concentrations to be mined, they are found together in complex mixtures that require substantial effort to further purify. The chemical reactivity of each of the 15 lanthanide elements is remarkably similar, with a strong and consistent preference for the +3 oxidation state. When things react in a similar way, isolating them in pure form <em><strong>from each other</strong></em> is expensive.</p><p>Of the lanthanides, Neodymium and Praseodymium are among the most valuable and the price of standard blends of their oxides have exploded to record highs in recent weeks. At the time of this writing, a kilogram of the blend costs $163 &#8211; up more than fourfold from the five-year bottom price of $35.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb227b12b-4039-4818-ab1c-67fa2d7a9023_2870x1372.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb227b12b-4039-4818-ab1c-67fa2d7a9023_2870x1372.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb227b12b-4039-4818-ab1c-67fa2d7a9023_2870x1372.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb227b12b-4039-4818-ab1c-67fa2d7a9023_2870x1372.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb227b12b-4039-4818-ab1c-67fa2d7a9023_2870x1372.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb227b12b-4039-4818-ab1c-67fa2d7a9023_2870x1372.png" width="1456" height="696" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b227b12b-4039-4818-ab1c-67fa2d7a9023_2870x1372.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:696,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1674603,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb227b12b-4039-4818-ab1c-67fa2d7a9023_2870x1372.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb227b12b-4039-4818-ab1c-67fa2d7a9023_2870x1372.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb227b12b-4039-4818-ab1c-67fa2d7a9023_2870x1372.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb227b12b-4039-4818-ab1c-67fa2d7a9023_2870x1372.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a></figure></div><p>In a story arc that will be all too familiar to <em>Doomberg</em> readers, for decades the US had a near monopoly on the mining and refining of rare earth elements, only to cede control over most of the value chain to China. The Mountain Pass Mine, located in San Bernardino County, California, was discovered in 1949 and went into operation in 1952. Faltering under environmental concerns and competitive pressure from China, the mine closed in 2002. Here&#8217;s how <em>Defense News</em> <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2019/11/12/the-collapse-of-american-rare-earth-mining-and-lessons-learned/">describes</a> the relevant history (emphasis added throughout this piece):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>In 1952, Mountain Pass opened. First explored as a uranium deposit, it soon supplied rare earths for the electronic needs of the Cold War economy. <strong>Until the 1990s, it stood alone as the only major source of rare earths worldwide</strong>.</em></p><p><em>By 2002, however, the mine was defunct. In the eyes of the U.S. government and major manufacturers, it no longer made sense to acquire rare earths from a U.S. source subject to <strong>stringent environmental regulations</strong>. Instead, the hard business of extracting useful minerals was exported to other countries, where environmental damage was safely out of sight. <strong>China happily obliged, allowing environmental harm to proliferate</strong> so long as the costs of rare earth mining were kept down.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>In 2008, Molycorp tried to resurrect the mine with an ambitious plan &#8211; dubbed Project Phoenix &#8211; to forward integrate into the production of ultra-high purity metals, alloys, and magnetic materials. With support from the US Department of Defense, the company completed a successful initial public offering (IPO) in 2010 and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). A series of technology failures and accounting scandals led the company to file for bankruptcy protection in 2014. Project Phoenix was a flop. The mine was purchased out of bankruptcy in 2017 for the paltry sum of $20.5 million, and the winning bidders <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jhl-qvt-shenghe-win-mountain-pass-mine-auction-1497479594">included</a> powerful investors from China:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em><strong>A buyout group backed by a Chinese company</strong> has been declared the winner at a bankruptcy auction for the Mountain Pass rare earths mine, the sole U.S. source of elements essential to electronics devices.</em></p><p><em>With a winning bid of $20.5 million, investment firms JHL Capital Group and QVT Financial were selected to take control of Mountain Pass, along with <strong>China&#8217;s Leshan Shenghe Rare Earth Shareholding Co.</strong>, according to sources present at the competition Wednesday.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Shenghe shared technology and helped capitalize the new company, eventually renamed to MP Materials Corp (MP), in exchange for offtake agreements and profit sharing. To this day, Shenghe remains MP&#8217;s only customer and the entire production of rare earth concentrate at Mountain Pass is shipped to China for final refining.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://doomberg.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Enjoy learning about the building blocks of the global economy?

Unlike most stocks that emerged from SPAC deals, MP has traded persistently well. At the time of this writing, the stock is trading hands for roughly $40 a share, or four times the initial deal price of $10. The stock is off 20% from its all-time high but compared to most previously hot SPAC stocks in its cohort, MP is an undeniable and smashing success.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfaec0-7953-43df-9b08-494905663a75_2870x1368.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfaec0-7953-43df-9b08-494905663a75_2870x1368.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfaec0-7953-43df-9b08-494905663a75_2870x1368.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfaec0-7953-43df-9b08-494905663a75_2870x1368.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfaec0-7953-43df-9b08-494905663a75_2870x1368.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfaec0-7953-43df-9b08-494905663a75_2870x1368.png" width="1456" height="694" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/98dfaec0-7953-43df-9b08-494905663a75_2870x1368.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:694,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1814512,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfaec0-7953-43df-9b08-494905663a75_2870x1368.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfaec0-7953-43df-9b08-494905663a75_2870x1368.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfaec0-7953-43df-9b08-494905663a75_2870x1368.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98dfaec0-7953-43df-9b08-494905663a75_2870x1368.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a></figure></div><p>The company has recently been the subject of two high-profile short seller reports, and on both occasions the news caused the stock to sell off precipitously. On October 26, 2021, Grizzly Research published a scathing <a href="https://grizzlyreports.com/mp-materials-corp-nysemp-rare-earth-shenanigans-in-chamath-backed-company-will-likely-cost-investors-dearly/">report</a> titled <em>MP Materials Corp.

According to Grizzly, MP is nothing more than a repackaged failed business that was dumped on investors at sky-high prices. They point to similarities between MP&#8217;s strategy and what Molycorp failed to do, how insiders have been selling stock at an alarming rate, and the company&#8217;s substantial dependence on Shenghe. The stock fell 20% on the news, but quickly recovered and eventually made new highs. Here&#8217;s a thread from Grizzly Research&#8217;s Twitter feed that summarizes the key accusations:</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/ResearchGrizzly/status/1453013684628992002?s=20&amp;t=kvgYX3-lVFMV46pEDEUddA&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;$MP Materials Corp came public on the NYSE in November 2020 through a SPAC reverse merger backed by &#8220;SPAC King&#8221; Chamath Palihapitiya.

A few facts &#128071;</a><a href="https://twitter.com/MPMaterials/status/1489299172444426241?s=20&amp;t=2Oic0lC41tVsv4wjV_-TwQ" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-footer"><p class="tweet-date">February 3rd 2022</p><span class="retweets"><span class="rt-count">42</span> Retweets</span><span class="likes"><span class="like-count">291</span> Likes</span></div></a></div><p>The Industrials and Materials Sector team at Hedgeye Risk Management, headed by Jay Van Sciver (you can follow his Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/HedgeyeIndstrls">here</a>), blasted the Bonitas report as &#8220;unsubstantiated, rehashed garbage,&#8221; and added MP to its Best Idea Long list. Once again, the stock fully recovered from the drop induced by the short report.</p><p>In full disclosure, no member of the <em>Doomberg</em> team has a position in MP, nor do we intend to open one (long or short) any time soon, if ever. Our interest in the company stems from our longstanding position that certain critical materials are worth producing domestically &#8211; a topic we&#8217;ve written about in the context of <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/herbie-spoils-the-party">polysilicon</a>, <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/magnesium-pi">magnesium</a>, and <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/contortion-nation">natural gas</a>. If MP is successful in reshoring a piece of the rare earth elements value chain in the US, we&#8217;re all for it.</p><p>At the heart of the short seller allegations is the relationship between MP and Shenghe. In reading the company&#8217;s filings, listening to their most recent conference calls, and reading presentation transcripts of investor meetings arranged by various investment bankers, MP has been quite transparent about the relationship with Shenghe, the ongoing obligations tied their offtake agreements, and the company&#8217;s long-term commercial strategy. Also, Shenghe did provide tangible financial and technical support to MP during this most recent relaunch of the Mountain Pass Mine, and it should be expected that they would share in the spoils of success per their original agreements from 2017 and beyond.</p><p>The bottom line from this team of natural born skeptics: the allegations seem more sensational than reality would support.</p><p>For example, the Grizzly Research team focuses much of their attention on the &#8220;discovery&#8221; that Shenghe is effectively controlled by the Chinese central government, specifically by China&#8217;s Treasury Department. Does anybody think Chinese companies operating in the rare earth elements industry <em><strong>aren&#8217;t</strong></em> under the direct control of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)? Last we checked, water is also wet.</p><p>Or take the Bonitas Research allegation that Shenghe is conspiring to prop up MP by absorbing losses on their own income statement to inflate MP&#8217;s earnings, thereby juicing the stock while they sell into the resulting strength. As MP points out in their Twitter thread rebutting the Bonitas report, Shenghe is a price-taking distributor, and pulling off such a scheme in a high-profile industry like rare earth elements is a little far-fetched. The net result of this unlikely conspiracy is a US-based company in the industry with a strong balance sheet and ready access to growth capital. If this is a trick of the CCP enacted via their proxy Shenghe, the geopolitical benefits to the Chinese aren&#8217;t obvious to us.&nbsp;</p><p>The remaining tangible allegations in the short thesis boil down to valuation, and here they may be justified. By most measures, the company is executing quite well, having delivered record production and sales volume in Q3 2021, exceeding what prior management teams were able to accomplish at the Mountain Pass Mine (the company reports Q4 2021 and full year numbers on February 24). Since NdPr and other rare earth elements are at extraordinarily high prices, annualizing the company&#8217;s most recent quarterly performance makes for a generous foundation upon which to measure its fair value. Nonetheless, using this approach gives us a sense of the optimism already baked in. Annualizing current prices, we arrive at $400 million a year in revenue and $1 per share of net income, for a price-to-sales multiple of 18 and a price-to-earnings multiple of 40. For a mining company &#8211; even one with a compelling national security and green energy narrative &#8211; MP is priced for perfect execution.</p><p>Investors are betting on the company&#8217;s ability to close the full supply chain loop, first by successfully demonstrating that it can isolate and purify individual rare earth elements onsite at Mountain Pass, and eventually by producing automotive-ready magnets in-house. Toward the latter goal &#8211; one which many believe is a stretch for the company &#8211; MP and General Motors recently surprised the market by <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/dec/1209-mpmaterials.html">announcing</a> a new partnership:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>General Motors (NYSE: GM) and MP Materials (NYSE: MP) today announced the formation of a strategic collaboration to develop a fully integrated U.S. supply chain for rare earth magnets. Under the long-term agreement, MP Materials will supply U.S.-sourced and manufactured rare earth materials, <strong>alloy and finished magnets for the electric motors</strong> used in the GMC HUMMER EV, Cadillac LYRIQ, Chevrolet Silverado EV and more than a dozen models using GM&#8217;s Ultium Platform, with <strong>a gradual production ramp that begins in 2023.</strong></em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>MP selected Fort Worth, Texas for the site of the proposed new magnet factory and will rely on the yet-to-be-completed refining operation at Mountain Pass for raw material supply. As risky and capital intense as these projects are, the company can certainly count on an unprecedented wave of strong support from the US government. Just last month, aggressive legislation was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/exclusive-us-bill-would-block-defense-contractors-using-chinese-rare-earths-2022-01-14/">introduced</a> in the US Senate in support of MP&#8217;s objectives:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>A bipartisan piece of legislation introduced in the U.S. Senate on Friday <strong>would force defense contractors to stop buying rare earths from China by 2026 and use the Pentagon to create a permanent stockpile of the strategic minerals.</strong></em></p><p><em>The bill, sponsored by Senators Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, and Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, is the latest in a string of <strong>U.S. legislation seeking to thwart China's near control over the sector</strong>.</em></p><p><em>It essentially uses the Pentagon's purchase of billions of dollars worth of fighter jets, missiles and other weapons as leverage to require contractors to stop relying on China and, by extension, <strong>support the revival of U.S. rare earths production</strong>.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Regardless of one&#8217;s view on the stock, the rare earth element story is worth watching, and MP&#8217;s success or failure will have ramifications that extend well beyond the stock price. The combination of national security interests, green energy applications, and the need for domestic onshoring of critical supply chain nodes are aligning in MP&#8217;s favor. Failure would be a sobering indictment on the ability of the US to retake control over its own economic destiny.</p><p>Count the <em>Doomberg</em> team as among those unabashedly hoping the company succeeds.</p><p><em><strong>If you enjoyed this piece, please do us the HUGE favor of simply clicking the LIKE button!</strong></em></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://doomberg.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://doomberg.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://doomberg.substack.com/p/not-a-rare-to-spare?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/not-a-rare-to-spare?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Contortion Nation]]></title><description><![CDATA[As another domestic pipeline project is shut down, Biden invites an energy alliance with the Emir of Qatar.]]></description><link>https://doomberg.substack.com/p/contortion-nation</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doomberg.substack.com/p/contortion-nation</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Doomberg]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 10:56:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4dce76eb-d11a-43db-98e3-6b9c9af17b1a_1631x1066.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;<em>Stupid is as stupid does.</em>&#8221; &#8211; Forrest Gump</p><p>The first episode of the seventh season of <em>Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown</em> is deeply moving. In the show, Bourdain visits Manila, the capital of the Philippines, for his usual mix of interesting food, drink, culture, and context. As Bourdain describes, domestic scarcity forces many Filipinos to leave their country and families behind in search of work overseas, and the money they send back home is critical to the Filipino economy. It is clear from the show that such decisions are gut-wrenching for those involved &#8211; the ultimate expression of love and loyalty &#8211; but the hard work and sacrifice for the chance to lift loved ones out of abject poverty are accepted as part of life.</p><p>One former overseas Filipino worker (OFW) profiled by Bourdain is Aurora Medina, a buoyant matriarch of a large, close-knit family who had recently returned home to Manila after 35 years abroad. In the final segment, Bourdain dines with Medina and her family in her humble dwelling &#8211; the money she made overseas having long-ago been distributed to educate at least a dozen close relatives. The audience learns that Medina was once the full-time nanny of one of the show&#8217;s directors for over 20 years, literally raising him and his sister from the time they were babies. The indirect reunion that follows is a profoundly emotional one.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cc7f817-d6e8-4c1e-82f6-adbd6e0ae814_2279x1423.jpeg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cc7f817-d6e8-4c1e-82f6-adbd6e0ae814_2279x1423.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cc7f817-d6e8-4c1e-82f6-adbd6e0ae814_2279x1423.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cc7f817-d6e8-4c1e-82f6-adbd6e0ae814_2279x1423.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cc7f817-d6e8-4c1e-82f6-adbd6e0ae814_2279x1423.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cc7f817-d6e8-4c1e-82f6-adbd6e0ae814_2279x1423.jpeg" width="1456" height="909" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0cc7f817-d6e8-4c1e-82f6-adbd6e0ae814_2279x1423.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:909,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2112901,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cc7f817-d6e8-4c1e-82f6-adbd6e0ae814_2279x1423.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cc7f817-d6e8-4c1e-82f6-adbd6e0ae814_2279x1423.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cc7f817-d6e8-4c1e-82f6-adbd6e0ae814_2279x1423.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cc7f817-d6e8-4c1e-82f6-adbd6e0ae814_2279x1423.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a></figure></div><p>For as much as Medina sacrificed, she is among the lucky former and current OFWs, having split her time overseas between Hong Kong and the US.

In a recent <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde22/4966/2021/en/">status update</a>, the group claims that despite pledges of reform on the part of the government, migrant workers still routinely face wage theft, barriers to switching jobs, confiscated passports, and dangerously unsafe working conditions. They further claim that the situation has <em><strong>deteriorated </strong></em>as the World Cup approaches. International human rights organizations are not the only ones sounding the alarm on Qatar. In a document <a href="https://www.state.gov/reports/2020-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/qatar/">published</a> by the US State Department called <em>2020 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Qatar</em>, a key paragraph in the executive summary reads as follows:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>Significant human rights issues included: restrictions on free expression, including criminalization of libel; restrictions on peaceful assembly and freedom of association, including prohibitions on political parties and labor unions; <strong>restrictions on migrant workers&#8217; freedom of movement</strong>; limits on the ability of citizens to choose their government in free and fair elections; lack of investigation of and accountability for </em>violence against women; <em>criminalization of consensual same-sex sexual conduct; and <strong>reports of forced labor</strong>.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Each migrant worker suffering in Qatar is somebody&#8217;s family member. A parent. A sibling. A cousin. A child. Every worker is <em><strong>somebody&#8217;s </strong></em>Aurora Medina, which makes the scene that unfolded in Washington, D.C. last week so bewildering. Reeling from the fallout of failed energy policies at home and in Europe, US President Biden hosted the Emir of Qatar at the White House, hoping to cut a deal to redirect future flotillas of liquified natural gas (LNG) from Asia to Europe, ostensibly as a hedge against Russia cutting off Europe&#8217;s supply in the event of a conflict over Ukraine. Here&#8217;s how an article <a href="https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/30295/a-new-era-in-us-qatar-relations">published</a> in <em>World Politics Review</em> describes what happened:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>Just before U.S. President Joe Biden met with Qatar&#8217;s emir, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, in the Oval Office on Tuesday, the White House shared a post on Twitter listing the visit&#8217;s agenda, which included &#8216;security and prosperity in the Middle East, global energy supplies, Afghanistan and more.&#8217; It was clear Sheikh Tamim&#8217;s visit was not just symbolic.</em></p><p><em><strong>Sheikh Tamim is the first regional leader to meet with Biden since he became president</strong>, a sign that Washington views Doha as an important element in confronting urgent U.S. priorities. And as if to underscore that point, <strong>Biden announced this week that he had designated Qatar a Non-NATO ally, a status that paves the way for greater cooperation on defense trade and security.</strong></em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F006d8a27-39ce-40e3-9b5c-967a81145b17_1080x720.jpeg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F006d8a27-39ce-40e3-9b5c-967a81145b17_1080x720.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F006d8a27-39ce-40e3-9b5c-967a81145b17_1080x720.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F006d8a27-39ce-40e3-9b5c-967a81145b17_1080x720.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F006d8a27-39ce-40e3-9b5c-967a81145b17_1080x720.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F006d8a27-39ce-40e3-9b5c-967a81145b17_1080x720.jpeg" width="1080" height="720" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/006d8a27-39ce-40e3-9b5c-967a81145b17_1080x720.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:720,&quot;width&quot;:1080,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:226469,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F006d8a27-39ce-40e3-9b5c-967a81145b17_1080x720.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F006d8a27-39ce-40e3-9b5c-967a81145b17_1080x720.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F006d8a27-39ce-40e3-9b5c-967a81145b17_1080x720.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F006d8a27-39ce-40e3-9b5c-967a81145b17_1080x720.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Photo Credit: Alex Brandon/AP</figcaption></figure></div><p>We can only assume that Qatar&#8217;s scandalous treatment of migrant workers and its longstanding tradition of funding terrorist organizations will soon be flushed down the memory hole.

The ruling said the permit approvals were premature &#8212; issued before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission&#8217;s (FERC) environmental assessment &#8212; and failed to comply with the Forest Service&#8217;s 2012 Planning rule. <strong>The decision effectively sends the project back into the review process for the second time since construction began in 2018.</strong></em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72189db5-fc6e-467d-a0c0-3702c302773e_1200x782.jpeg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72189db5-fc6e-467d-a0c0-3702c302773e_1200x782.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72189db5-fc6e-467d-a0c0-3702c302773e_1200x782.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72189db5-fc6e-467d-a0c0-3702c302773e_1200x782.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72189db5-fc6e-467d-a0c0-3702c302773e_1200x782.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72189db5-fc6e-467d-a0c0-3702c302773e_1200x782.jpeg" width="1200" height="782" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/72189db5-fc6e-467d-a0c0-3702c302773e_1200x782.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:782,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:158492,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72189db5-fc6e-467d-a0c0-3702c302773e_1200x782.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72189db5-fc6e-467d-a0c0-3702c302773e_1200x782.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72189db5-fc6e-467d-a0c0-3702c302773e_1200x782.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72189db5-fc6e-467d-a0c0-3702c302773e_1200x782.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Mountain Valley Pipeline | Photo credit: Heather Rousseau/AP</figcaption></figure></div><p>The immediate consequences of the ruling are as follows. First, incremental natural gas produced in Appalachia will be stranded there, driving down prices in that region while increasing prices for the rest of the US market, which was counting on ready access to Appalachian production to meet their future needs. Second, the decision will limit the ability of US LNG export terminals to meet global natural gas demand, further eroding our geopolitical power and emboldening our adversaries &#8211; forcing us to make unseemly alliances with despots like the Emir of Qatar. Finally, the decision will make it even harder to attract much-needed capital for future domestic energy development projects. The Mountain Valley Pipeline project received its Certificate of Convenience and Necessity from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission <em><strong>on October 13, 2017</strong></em> and construction began months thereafter. That it is <em><strong>still</strong></em> in political limbo more than five years later sends a loud and clear message to energy investors: look elsewhere to deploy capital. Here&#8217;s another quote from an <a href="https://rbnenergy.com/up-around-the-bend-part-3-midstream-constraints-loom-for-northeast-gas-production">earlier piece</a> by <em>RBN Energy</em> which foreshadowed the consequences of the latest events:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>It&#8217;s no secret to anybody paying attention to U.S. natural gas markets that <strong>Appalachia has long been bedeviled by midstream constraints</strong>, often leading to deep gas price discounts. There have been brief respites when new capacity has come online, allowing more gas to flow out, but if you've been reading our blogs and natural gas reports lately, you know we've been sounding the alarm about the growing specter of constraints reemerging. Across the country, the boom in pipeline reversals, greenfield projects, and pipeline expansions that characterized much of the 2010s is pretty much over, <strong>with just a couple of approved expansions left, and it&#8217;s gotten much harder for projects offering additional capacity to gain traction, especially in the Northeast.</strong></em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>We wish we could close this piece on an uplifting note but are instead exhausted from unfurling the contortions of our political establishment. What&#8217;s clear is that we are an unserious people in a do loop of unproductive contradictions rapidly hurling towards parts unknown.</p><p>We like Bourdain&#8217;s version much better.</p><p><em><strong>If you enjoyed this piece, please do us the HUGE favor of simply clicking the LIKE button!</strong></em></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://doomberg.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://doomberg.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://doomberg.substack.com/p/contortion-nation?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/contortion-nation?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[That's the Good Stuff]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Work of My Life: January 2022 Report | The soulful contour of the human endeavor is what drives the popularity of authenticity over perfection.]]></description><link>https://doomberg.substack.com/p/thats-the-good-stuff</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doomberg.substack.com/p/thats-the-good-stuff</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Doomberg]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 03 Feb 2022 11:33:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e7bd7c8a-5eae-4dc3-baa1-5762bbae1923_840x600.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;<em>I had a lot of chess knowledge and I had no one to share it with.</em>&#8221; &#8211; Antonio Radi&#263;</p><p>In May of 1997, a specialized computer built by IBM defeated the reigning world chess champion in a highly anticipated six-game match. Deep Blue&#8217;s 3&#189;-2&#189; victory over Garry Kasparov capped a multi-decade long quest by the computer industry to conquer the Game of Kings. There was some <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24354219">controversy</a> surrounding the match &#8211; Kasparov never was the most <a href="https://en.chessbase.com/post/kasparov-s-outburst-over-beauty-prize-in-linares">gracious</a> loser &#8211; but it is generally agreed that Deep Blue&#8217;s accomplishment marked a significant milestone in the ultimate contest between human and machine.</p><p>In the following years, the particulars of the controversy were no match for the relentless exponential growth in computing power available to programmers, and it quickly became apparent that even the best human grandmasters would struggle to achieve a mere draw against dedicated machines. Many fretted that the proficiency of computers and their capacity for perfect play would mark the end of the world&#8217;s enchantment with chess.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53a267ad-5744-41e5-bc3d-c9743d0c5905_916x561.jpeg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53a267ad-5744-41e5-bc3d-c9743d0c5905_916x561.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53a267ad-5744-41e5-bc3d-c9743d0c5905_916x561.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53a267ad-5744-41e5-bc3d-c9743d0c5905_916x561.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53a267ad-5744-41e5-bc3d-c9743d0c5905_916x561.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53a267ad-5744-41e5-bc3d-c9743d0c5905_916x561.jpeg" width="656" height="401.764192139738" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/53a267ad-5744-41e5-bc3d-c9743d0c5905_916x561.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:561,&quot;width&quot;:916,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:656,&quot;bytes&quot;:169236,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53a267ad-5744-41e5-bc3d-c9743d0c5905_916x561.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53a267ad-5744-41e5-bc3d-c9743d0c5905_916x561.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53a267ad-5744-41e5-bc3d-c9743d0c5905_916x561.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53a267ad-5744-41e5-bc3d-c9743d0c5905_916x561.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Deep Blue v.

Unfortunately for the Croatian-born Radi&#263;, his copy was of the German variety and he was forced to play the game with a Croatian-German dictionary by his side. Despite having an International Federation of Chess (FIDE) Master as a grandfather, Radi&#263; rebuffed earnest attempts to have him follow a similar path, preferring instead to pass his time playing video games and watching English-language cartoons on the television. Kids will be kids, after all.</p><p>Fast forward a decade. Computers were regularly trouncing all human chess players and 16-year-old Radi&#263; discovered a deep passion for the game, beginning a most unlikely journey to the top of the chess world. Although Radi&#263; is an above average player &#8211; his <a href="https://ratings.fide.com/profile/14531348">FIDE rating</a> currently sits at 1,950 &#8211; it isn&#8217;t his playing that makes him a household name among chess enthusiasts.

Churned out by computer algorithms optimized to trick people into staring at whatever targeted advertisement awaits, the written word has been reduced to just another empty commodity. Newsrooms have been hollowed. What remain are organizations incentivized to stoke division with pseudo-controversies and half-told news.</p><p>With <em>Doomberg</em>, we are proud to be swimming against this powerful current. While we expect that readers might not agree with everything we publish, our focus on quality writing, cited research, crisp visuals, and tight editing continues to attract genuine engagement that has catalyzed growth far exceeding what we thought possible when we embarked on this life-changing adventure nine short months ago. </p><p>January was another spectacular month for us. We set new records for absolute growth in views, email subscribers, and Twitter followers. The seven articles we published in the month have <em><strong>averaged 85,000 </strong></em><strong>views</strong>, and our most widely-read <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/dollars-ex-machina">piece</a> &#8211; <em>Dollars Ex Machina</em> &#8211; is approaching 110,000.

Roosevelt</p><p>On July 26, 1941, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) seized all Japanese assets in the US and imposed a strict oil embargo on the country. Britain and the Dutch East Indies &#8211; the colonial predecessor to modern-day Indonesia and a major oil supplier to Japan &#8211; quickly followed suit. Virtually overnight, Japan lost three quarters of its trade and nearly 90% of its oil imports. Faced with limited domestic oil inventory, minimal capacity for production, and few options beyond a humiliating surrender of their geopolitical aims to a hostile foreign power, Japan made the fateful decision to go to war with the US. The attack on Pearl Harbor a little more than four months later was driven by Japan&#8217;s ultimate need to occupy, defend, and exploit the energy bounty of the Dutch East Indies, which they proceeded to do a month after severely weakening the US forces in the Pacific. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4bb232f-b892-49bd-a1dd-975586bf843d_1041x733.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4bb232f-b892-49bd-a1dd-975586bf843d_1041x733.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4bb232f-b892-49bd-a1dd-975586bf843d_1041x733.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4bb232f-b892-49bd-a1dd-975586bf843d_1041x733.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4bb232f-b892-49bd-a1dd-975586bf843d_1041x733.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4bb232f-b892-49bd-a1dd-975586bf843d_1041x733.png" width="636" height="447.8270893371758" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e4bb232f-b892-49bd-a1dd-975586bf843d_1041x733.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:733,&quot;width&quot;:1041,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:636,&quot;bytes&quot;:252181,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4bb232f-b892-49bd-a1dd-975586bf843d_1041x733.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4bb232f-b892-49bd-a1dd-975586bf843d_1041x733.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4bb232f-b892-49bd-a1dd-975586bf843d_1041x733.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4bb232f-b892-49bd-a1dd-975586bf843d_1041x733.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a></figure></div><p>If energy is life, then the lack of energy is death. When one stares death in the face, to fight &#8211; however remote the odds of victory might be &#8211; is the only rational option. The actions of Japan make sense in that context. As brilliantly explained in Daniel Yergin&#8217;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Prize-Epic-Quest-Money-Power/dp/1439110123">iconic book</a> <em>The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money &amp; Power</em>, modern history is best viewed through the lens of energy: the pursuit of that which is not had, and the use of that which is. Bombs are nothing more than carriers of extreme amounts of potential energy and unleashing that energy in targeted areas has the effect of creating devastating disorder in those environments. Wars are ultimately decided by which side can harvest and deliver more destructive energy to the other, explaining Churchill&#8217;s obsession with the Middle East and Hitler&#8217;s decision to prioritize Germany&#8217;s drive on The Caucasus prior to toppling Moscow &#8211; a choice that likely cost him the war.</p><p>The US was an energy superpower during World War II and as its soil was unlikely to become a direct battlefield, whether and how the US might participate would prove decisive. The existing combatants expended significant resources attempting to influence this all-important outcome. In his excellent but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Dealers-War-Within-World/dp/0465024653">brutally critical book</a> <em>The New Dealers' War: FDR and the War Within World War II</em>, decorated historian Thomas Fleming lays bare just how desperate FDR was to provoke Japan into war. Most disturbingly, the book documents how the British and, to a greater extent, Stalin&#8217;s Russia infiltrated and corrupted much of the geopolitical policy-making bureaucracy of the US, thereby tilting the scales in their favor.</p><p>The US is still the largest producer of oil and gas in the world, making its energy policy &#8211; and the desire of foreign powers to influence it &#8211; no less important than it was then. Longtime readers of <em>Doomberg</em> will know we have been critical of America&#8217;s <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/americas-energy-strategy-is-bonkers">energy strategy</a> and have spilled much ink describing the <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/starvation-diet">predictable consequences</a> of its obvious blunders.

On Thursday, a lone federal judge appointed by former President Obama revoked entire swaths of recently auctioned oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico. Here is the <em>New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/climate/federal-court-drilling-gulf.html">reporting</a> on the decision (emphasis added throughout this piece):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>A federal judge on Thursday canceled oil and gas leases of more than <strong>80 million acres</strong> in the Gulf of Mexico, ruling that <strong>the Biden administration did not sufficiently take climate change into account</strong> when it auctioned the leases late last year.</em></p><p><em>The decision by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia <strong>is a major victory for environmental groups</strong> that criticized the Biden administration for holding the sale after promising to move the country away from fossil fuels. It had been the largest lease sale in United States history.</em></p><p><em>Now <strong>the Interior Department must conduct a new environmental analysis</strong> that accounts for the greenhouse gas emissions that would result from the eventual development and production of the leases. After that, the agency will have to decide whether it will hold a new auction.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>The environmental group behind the push to obstruct the oil and gas industry &#8211; and the first one quoted in the full <em>New York Times</em> article &#8211; is an outfit called Earthjustice, which describes itself as the premier nonprofit public interest environmental law organization. They boast of deploying 170 lawyers against &#8220;630+ active legal proceedings.&#8221; Here is their homepage, where they unironically declare what is actually being delivered to Mother Earth&#8230;.legal fees:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70ea99ff-925d-44e0-bbfe-831094516f79_2206x1098.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70ea99ff-925d-44e0-bbfe-831094516f79_2206x1098.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70ea99ff-925d-44e0-bbfe-831094516f79_2206x1098.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70ea99ff-925d-44e0-bbfe-831094516f79_2206x1098.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70ea99ff-925d-44e0-bbfe-831094516f79_2206x1098.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70ea99ff-925d-44e0-bbfe-831094516f79_2206x1098.png" width="666" height="331.62774725274727" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/70ea99ff-925d-44e0-bbfe-831094516f79_2206x1098.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:725,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:666,&quot;bytes&quot;:3118715,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70ea99ff-925d-44e0-bbfe-831094516f79_2206x1098.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70ea99ff-925d-44e0-bbfe-831094516f79_2206x1098.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70ea99ff-925d-44e0-bbfe-831094516f79_2206x1098.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70ea99ff-925d-44e0-bbfe-831094516f79_2206x1098.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a></figure></div><p>A perusal of their main policy <a href="https://earthjustice.org/our_work/clean-energy">page</a> titled &#8220;<em>Power Everything With 100% Clean Energy</em>&#8221; reveals zero mentions of the word &#8220;nuclear,&#8221; and using this keyword to search their website uncovers a string of mostly negative commentary on the topic, confirming our suspicion that members of Earthjustice are either anti-human, deniers of physics, or both.

This simple shift from drilling to completion is obviously unsustainable, and absent a material change, may result in disappointing production and higher prices.</em></p><p><em>Compounding problems for producers, DUC inventory shortages may actually be worse than reported. <strong>Historically, 95% of wells drilled have been completed within 2 years; DUCs older than 2 years are considered &#8220;dead&#8221; and the probability they are completed falls drastically</strong>. The inventory of live DUCs likely to be completed is likely overreported, as most conventional sources fail to make this important distinction.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><p>With demand for oil and gas already surpassing pre-Covid levels and set to rip higher once the global economy fully reopens, the stage is set for an epic blowoff top in energy prices. The gap between suppressed supply and unquenchable demand could stretch to unthinkable levels, just as a sizable wedge of the world&#8217;s population sits on the cusp of a well-known and substantial step-up in demand. To illustrate this concept, first brought to our attention by the <a href="http://gorozen.com/">team</a> at Goehring &amp; Rozencwajg, shown below is a chart originally published by Morgan Stanley. It is a powerful visualization of demand for energy on a per capita basis which soars once a certain standard of living is achieved. Represented here as the Human Development Index, a composite index of life expectancy, education, and per capita income, it is used by the United Nations to rank countries into tiers of human development. As notated on the chart, nearly 5.5 billion people reside below the take-off point, and their expectations won&#8217;t be easily constrained.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0dec5b7-13b0-4ae9-b177-3a8db315dbaa_828x597.jpeg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0dec5b7-13b0-4ae9-b177-3a8db315dbaa_828x597.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0dec5b7-13b0-4ae9-b177-3a8db315dbaa_828x597.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0dec5b7-13b0-4ae9-b177-3a8db315dbaa_828x597.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0dec5b7-13b0-4ae9-b177-3a8db315dbaa_828x597.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0dec5b7-13b0-4ae9-b177-3a8db315dbaa_828x597.jpeg" width="828" height="597" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a0dec5b7-13b0-4ae9-b177-3a8db315dbaa_828x597.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:597,&quot;width&quot;:828,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:39800,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0dec5b7-13b0-4ae9-b177-3a8db315dbaa_828x597.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0dec5b7-13b0-4ae9-b177-3a8db315dbaa_828x597.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0dec5b7-13b0-4ae9-b177-3a8db315dbaa_828x597.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0dec5b7-13b0-4ae9-b177-3a8db315dbaa_828x597.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a></figure></div><p>We close with a few words of caution for those investors looking to profit from the forces converging to drive energy prices higher: time your trades carefully.

We mask the full details here to protect anonymity but believe us when we say this person has a knack for being incredibly early to imminent megatrends at the bleeding edge of technical and social disruptions. His pitch involved a company he and some colleagues were starting that had something to do with &#8220;bitcoin,&#8221; which he described to us as a form of &#8220;crypto currency.&#8221; We knew precious little about bitcoin or crypto currencies back then, nor did we understand what the newly formed company intended to do, but in a classic &#8220;bet the jockey, not the horse&#8221; move, we agreed to participate in the seed round at the minimum investment level. We immediately marked this equity investment to zero on our personal balance sheets.</p><p>In the following months, we engaged in a series of philosophical conversations about crypto currencies with our friend to learn more. Concurrent with this quest for knowledge, the paper value of our modest investment began to soar, which had the understandable effect of increasing the urgency of our research. We distinctly recall drawing two circles on a piece of paper. In the circle on the left, we wrote &#8220;real economy,&#8221; while in the circle on the right we wrote &#8220;crypto universe.&#8221; We drew two pipes between the circles &#8211; one flowing into the crypto universe and the other flowing back to the real economy &#8211; and labeled both pipes with &#8220;fiat currencies.&#8221; While we understood how fiat currencies from investors could flow in, we failed to grasp what could be occurring within the crypto universe that would create <em><strong>more</strong></em> fiat currency for investors to take out at a later date. There seemed to be many brilliant people excited to be working in the space and using a technical language foreign to us, so we concluded that our inability to understand this rather pertinent issue was a fault of our own making.</p><p>Then bitcoin went bananas in late 2017.</p><p>They say we are shaped by our experiences, and as bitcoin went parabolic it certainly impacted us. Watching our modest foray into a little understood technology skyrocket in paper value <em><strong>several hundredfold</strong></em> left a jagged mark as it crashed with the rest of the crypto market back to where we had always kept it marked &#8211; <em><strong>zero</strong></em>.&nbsp; Along the way, we did make a few half-hearted efforts to get the outflow pipe turned on &#8211; life-changing fortunes are worth bending over and picking up, after all &#8211; but since we could not get an answer to our foundational question, we never held out much hope of converting paper into reality. There would be no lambos for the green chicken team.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20b00c4d-14cf-415c-b362-9262d3340256_1000x596.jpeg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20b00c4d-14cf-415c-b362-9262d3340256_1000x596.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20b00c4d-14cf-415c-b362-9262d3340256_1000x596.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20b00c4d-14cf-415c-b362-9262d3340256_1000x596.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20b00c4d-14cf-415c-b362-9262d3340256_1000x596.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20b00c4d-14cf-415c-b362-9262d3340256_1000x596.jpeg" width="1000" height="596" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/20b00c4d-14cf-415c-b362-9262d3340256_1000x596.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:596,&quot;width&quot;:1000,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:194401,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20b00c4d-14cf-415c-b362-9262d3340256_1000x596.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20b00c4d-14cf-415c-b362-9262d3340256_1000x596.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20b00c4d-14cf-415c-b362-9262d3340256_1000x596.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20b00c4d-14cf-415c-b362-9262d3340256_1000x596.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a></figure></div><p>It is through this tortured lens that we read with some interest a recent article by Sohale Mortazavi, <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2022/01/cryptocurrency-scam-blockchain-bitcoin-economy-decentralization">published</a> in the socialist magazine <em>Jacobin</em>. Sporting the provocative title <em>Cryptocurrency Is a Giant Ponzi Scheme</em>, the author pulls no punches in stating what he really thinks of the entire space. What caught our eye was his observation that cryptos aren&#8217;t merely a zero-sum game &#8211; in fact, inherent in the design of the entire system is a negative-sum occurrence in which the outflow pipe of fiat currencies available to investors must <em><strong>always</strong></em> be smaller than the inflow pipe (emphasis added throughout this piece):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>The majority of cryptocurrency mining is now conducted in commercial mining farms, essentially huge warehouses running thousands of high-powered computer processors day and night. The electricity expended mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is rapidly approaching 1 percent of global usage, which is famously greater than the total electricity consumption of many smaller developed nations.</em></p><p><em>Given that cryptocurrencies don&#8217;t produce anything of material value, this enormous waste of resources <strong>renders the whole enterprise a negative-sum game. Investors can only cash out by selling their coins to other investors</strong> &#8212; but only after the miners and various cryptocurrency service providers take the house&#8217;s rake. In other words, investors cannot &#8212; <strong>in the aggregate</strong> &#8212; cash out for even what they put in, as cryptocurrencies are inefficient by design.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb1251c0-b80f-4ef3-95cc-f9a791c29d31_1600x1066.webp"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb1251c0-b80f-4ef3-95cc-f9a791c29d31_1600x1066.webp 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb1251c0-b80f-4ef3-95cc-f9a791c29d31_1600x1066.webp 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb1251c0-b80f-4ef3-95cc-f9a791c29d31_1600x1066.webp 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb1251c0-b80f-4ef3-95cc-f9a791c29d31_1600x1066.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb1251c0-b80f-4ef3-95cc-f9a791c29d31_1600x1066.webp" width="1456" height="970" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/db1251c0-b80f-4ef3-95cc-f9a791c29d31_1600x1066.webp&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:970,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:256124,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb1251c0-b80f-4ef3-95cc-f9a791c29d31_1600x1066.webp 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb1251c0-b80f-4ef3-95cc-f9a791c29d31_1600x1066.webp 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb1251c0-b80f-4ef3-95cc-f9a791c29d31_1600x1066.webp 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb1251c0-b80f-4ef3-95cc-f9a791c29d31_1600x1066.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a></figure></div><p>There&#8217;s simply no arguing that <em><strong>if one uses fiat currencies as the determining scorecard</strong></em>, the crypto universe is a Ponzi scheme. The structural costs of mining &#8211; which must ultimately be paid for using fiat &#8211; aren&#8217;t the only thing that shrinks the outflow pipe for regular investors. Outright theft of fiat deposits, whether via hacks, rug pulls, or illegal front-running by lawless market &#8220;participants&#8221; are a substantial drain on the total fiat floating around in the crypto universe.</p><p>Before the bitcoin maxis fill our comments with well-worn whataboutisms, we readily concede the real economy is <em><strong>filled</strong></em> with government-backed Ponzi schemes, legal or otherwise. Take the US Social Security system. New money will forever be needed to pay off old promises and absent the US government&#8217;s ability to print unbacked fiat, the entire edifice would collapse. But those systems <em><strong>are blessed by the state</strong></em>, and &#8211; by and large &#8211; the crypto universe is not. More critically, we believe precious few crypto participants today are in it to support their belief that the final chapter for fiat currencies has been written. They&#8217;re in it as a trade and are hoping to leave the crypto universe with more fiat in their traditional banking accounts than they entered with. Most won&#8217;t. If you don&#8217;t know who the sucker is at the digital poker table, you are probably a HODLer.</p><p>Just how much fiat is sloshing around in crypto universe? Because of the fraudulent sleight of hand of fiat clones called stablecoins, crypto investors routinely mark their books in fiat currencies like the US dollar, when in fact they should be marked in the underlying stablecoin, like tether. Bitcoin is not worth 36,000 US dollars, which is about where it is &#8220;trading&#8221; today. It is worth 36,000 tethers, the dominant underlying stablecoin in which it transacts.</p><p>On a recent appearance on the Crypto Critics&#8217; Corner, which <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/crypto-critics-corner/id1557045965?i=1000548817257">published yesterday</a>, we discussed this issue at length (the hosts of the show, Bennett Tomlin and Cas Piancey, can be followed on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/BennettTomlin">here</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/CasPiancey">here</a>, respectively). If one assumes the total value of the crypto universe is marked at $2 trillion, and if the total amount of hard fiat (pun intended) in the system is the equivalent of only a few tens of billions of US dollars, then the leverage ratio of the crypto universe is enormous when measured in fiat. In a true market panic, which may or may not be unfolding as we publish this piece, we suspect many investors would be stuck holding the bag without recourse. These are largely unregulated markets where hacks, thefts, and total exchange collapses are routine.</p><p>Our focus on mapping the fiat currency moving in and out of the crypto universe leads us to update our readers on two of the highest profile names in this space: Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, and Nayib Bukele, President of El Salvador. We had previously written about Saylor&#8217;s adventures with bitcoin <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/a-drunken-saylor">here</a>, and Bukele&#8217;s <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/el-salv-a-door">here</a>. Both are facing renewed pressure as the crypto markets wobble, both are on the hook for substantial debts denominated in <em><strong>US dollars</strong></em>, and both risk potentially losing control &#8211; as unlikely as that might seem now.</p><p>For Saylor, we (and many others) have described the dangerous game he is playing, having issued $2.2 billion in dollar-denominated debt to buy bitcoin. This includes $1.7 billion in two convertible notes, which were then subsequently primed by the issuance of a $500 million senior secured straight bond above them in the capital table. The weakest of the convertible notes has a conversion price of $1,432 per share, and with MicroStrategy&#8217;s stock trading near $370 a share overnight, the convert option is <em><strong>deeply</strong></em> out of the money. As of yesterday&#8217;s close, the bonds are trading in distressed territory, catching only 62 cents on the dollar for a 9.6% yield to maturity.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69901d64-acdb-4389-a06d-e188f630b5b7_2868x1492.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69901d64-acdb-4389-a06d-e188f630b5b7_2868x1492.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69901d64-acdb-4389-a06d-e188f630b5b7_2868x1492.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69901d64-acdb-4389-a06d-e188f630b5b7_2868x1492.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69901d64-acdb-4389-a06d-e188f630b5b7_2868x1492.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69901d64-acdb-4389-a06d-e188f630b5b7_2868x1492.png" width="1456" height="757" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/69901d64-acdb-4389-a06d-e188f630b5b7_2868x1492.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:757,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1780810,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69901d64-acdb-4389-a06d-e188f630b5b7_2868x1492.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69901d64-acdb-4389-a06d-e188f630b5b7_2868x1492.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69901d64-acdb-4389-a06d-e188f630b5b7_2868x1492.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69901d64-acdb-4389-a06d-e188f630b5b7_2868x1492.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a></figure></div><p>As first pointed out to us by Mike Green on Twitter, Michael Kao &#8211; a convertible bond expert &#8211; has been speculating for many months that Saylor could lose control over MicroStrategy in the event of a deep drawdown in bitcoin&#8217;s value. Kao argues persuasively that Saylor&#8217;s fiduciary is not just to his shareholders, but also his debtholders, especially if the company enters a zone of insolvency. MicroStrategy owns more than 124,000 bitcoins, worth over $4 billion at today&#8217;s prices. Note that <em><strong>Saylor</strong></em> doesn&#8217;t own these bitcoins, the company does &#8211; making Saylor&#8217;s personal conviction less relevant. The company&#8217;s board might decide to turn off their laser eyes in a time of true crisis despite Saylor&#8217;s current position as board chair. If the company liquidated its bitcoin into a downdraft, we suspect we&#8217;d find out just how much fiat exists in the crypto universe rather quickly. MicroStrategy&#8217;s bondholders can&#8217;t be paid back in tethers, after all.</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/profplum99/status/1484654536996245506?s=20&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;8/n Best thread there remains <span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@UrbanKaoboy</span>'s epic analysis.

Luckily for us, it was among our earliest works and so most of you haven&#8217;t read it. Recent developments appear to lay bare his strategy. Like Saylor, Bukele has US dollar-denominated debt, but his situation is a little more urgent. In less than a year, El Salvador has a $800 million bond coming due, and it is currently priced in extremely distressed territory. When Bukele shocked the world with his adoption of bitcoin as legal tender in early June, that bond was priced to yield 6%. If an investor picked up the bond today and held it to maturity, they could expect a staggering 35% return &#8211; which says more about the risk of default than it does the attractiveness of the opportunity.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd29ff340-7685-4ddb-b984-f3ae81137ef9_2880x1482.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd29ff340-7685-4ddb-b984-f3ae81137ef9_2880x1482.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd29ff340-7685-4ddb-b984-f3ae81137ef9_2880x1482.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd29ff340-7685-4ddb-b984-f3ae81137ef9_2880x1482.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd29ff340-7685-4ddb-b984-f3ae81137ef9_2880x1482.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd29ff340-7685-4ddb-b984-f3ae81137ef9_2880x1482.png" width="1456" height="749" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d29ff340-7685-4ddb-b984-f3ae81137ef9_2880x1482.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:749,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1161751,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd29ff340-7685-4ddb-b984-f3ae81137ef9_2880x1482.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd29ff340-7685-4ddb-b984-f3ae81137ef9_2880x1482.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd29ff340-7685-4ddb-b984-f3ae81137ef9_2880x1482.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd29ff340-7685-4ddb-b984-f3ae81137ef9_2880x1482.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a></figure></div><p>It probably didn&#8217;t help matters that Bukele tweeted &#8220;DGAF&#8221;

By selling bitcoin-backed bonds through blockchain infrastructure, El Salvador will bypass the Wall Street banks and international institutions that have had a century-long choke hold on loans to developing economies. There are signs that this could escalate into a full-scale public battle as global financiers angle to retain control of the system.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>If we follow the fiat in this proposed offering, Bukele is encouraging fresh investors to come into the crypto universe with new money so he can turn around and use it to pay off his country&#8217;s debt. While he would like <em><strong>you </strong></em>to HODL, <em><strong>he</strong></em> literally can&#8217;t. While we admire the boldness of his gambit, it is unclear to us what Plan B is in the event of a true crypto washout. Like Saylor, his obligations are firmly entrenched in the real economy. If the leverage ratio of the crypto universe is as high as we suspect it is, the risk of an unraveling is very real.</p><p><em><strong>If you enjoyed this piece, please do us the HUGE favor of simply clicking the LIKE button!</strong></em></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://doomberg.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://doomberg.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://doomberg.substack.com/p/dollars-ex-machina?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/dollars-ex-machina?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9aa07bbd-cfb0-46b4-a10a-8f72d9b4693a_840x600.jpeg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9aa07bbd-cfb0-46b4-a10a-8f72d9b4693a_840x600.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9aa07bbd-cfb0-46b4-a10a-8f72d9b4693a_840x600.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9aa07bbd-cfb0-46b4-a10a-8f72d9b4693a_840x600.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9aa07bbd-cfb0-46b4-a10a-8f72d9b4693a_840x600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9aa07bbd-cfb0-46b4-a10a-8f72d9b4693a_840x600.jpeg" width="840" height="600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9aa07bbd-cfb0-46b4-a10a-8f72d9b4693a_840x600.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:600,&quot;width&quot;:840,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:59899,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9aa07bbd-cfb0-46b4-a10a-8f72d9b4693a_840x600.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9aa07bbd-cfb0-46b4-a10a-8f72d9b4693a_840x600.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9aa07bbd-cfb0-46b4-a10a-8f72d9b4693a_840x600.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9aa07bbd-cfb0-46b4-a10a-8f72d9b4693a_840x600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a></figure></div>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pawn to G7]]></title><description><![CDATA[For Lithuania, outhustling and outlasting superpowers is in the country&#8217;s DNA.]]></description><link>https://doomberg.substack.com/p/pawn-to-g7</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://doomberg.substack.com/p/pawn-to-g7</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Doomberg]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 14:39:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18d50405-e23b-4870-9b1d-571fdc958636_840x600.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;<em>We are not merely passive pawns of historical forces; nor are we victims of the past. We can shape and direct history.</em>&#8221; &#8211; Daisaku Ikeda</p><p>The best professional players from the National Basketball Association (NBA) became eligible to compete in the Olympic Games in 1992. In that inaugural year, the USA Men's Basketball National Team featured legendary players Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, and Charles Barkley, and is widely considered to be the greatest athletic team ever assembled in any sport.&nbsp; The Dream Team was truly a global cultural phenomenon, destroying all opponents on its way to clinching the gold medal and reestablishing the US as the dominant superpower in basketball. Asked at a press conference about their hapless opponent prior to their debut game at the Barcelona Olympics, Barkley famously responded &#8220;<em>I don&#8217;t know much about Angola, but Angola&#8217;s in trouble.&#8221;</em></p><p>The 2004 incarnation of the US team that competed in Athens, Greece, was a little less dreamy. Despite featuring NBA superstars Lebron James, Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony, and Tim Duncan, the team struggled to perform at a level commensurate with its talent. In its fourth game at the event, already reeling from an opening round loss to Puerto Rico, the US took to the court to face Lithuania, a country with barely three million residents. Amazingly, the Lithuanians outhustled the US, played better defense, and hit pivotal shots down the stretch on their way to shocking the basketball world and upsetting their opponents with a score of 94-90. Fireworks erupted in Vilnius, Lithuania&#8217;s capital, as citizens throughout the basketball-crazed country took to the streets to celebrate this most unlikely accomplishment.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f584406-f341-4d07-92ed-0524927a8b85_869x1079.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f584406-f341-4d07-92ed-0524927a8b85_869x1079.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f584406-f341-4d07-92ed-0524927a8b85_869x1079.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f584406-f341-4d07-92ed-0524927a8b85_869x1079.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f584406-f341-4d07-92ed-0524927a8b85_869x1079.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f584406-f341-4d07-92ed-0524927a8b85_869x1079.png" width="674" height="836.8768699654776" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1f584406-f341-4d07-92ed-0524927a8b85_869x1079.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1079,&quot;width&quot;:869,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:674,&quot;bytes&quot;:1173378,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f584406-f341-4d07-92ed-0524927a8b85_869x1079.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f584406-f341-4d07-92ed-0524927a8b85_869x1079.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f584406-f341-4d07-92ed-0524927a8b85_869x1079.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f584406-f341-4d07-92ed-0524927a8b85_869x1079.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Photo credit: Salt Lake Tribune</figcaption></figure></div><p>There&#8217;s much to admire about Lithuania, beginning with the fact that it is has managed to cement itself as an independent nation at all. Given its strategic geographic position linking the Baltic littoral with Central Europe, the people of Lithuania have suffered for centuries at the hands of the conflicting superpowers that surround them. Take World War II, during which Lithuania was first occupied by the Soviets, then overrun by the Nazis, only to be re-occupied by the Soviets again. Lithuanian patriots have fought unrelenting rebellions against whoever claimed military control over their homeland and were the first of the former Soviet republics to declare independence on March 11, 1990. Outhustling and outlasting superpowers &#8211; whether in sports or in geopolitics &#8211; appears to be in the country&#8217;s DNA.</p><p>In a move that caught geopolitical analysts by surprise, Lithuania recently picked a fight with another global superpower by inserting itself into the tensions over Taiwan. In November of 2021, Lithuania allowed the disputed territory to setup the Taiwanese Representative Office within its borders. This might not seem like such a big deal at first blush, but for the Communist Party of China (CCP) it crossed a deadly serious red line. In most other countries, such office names refer to the city of Taipei, not the country of Taiwan, and are called Taipei Cultural and Economic Centers. In the eyes of the CCP, Lithuania &#8211; a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the European Union (EU), and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) &#8211; has allowed Taiwan to open a de facto embassy, a huge no-no.

It is also <strong>blocking all products containing components made in Lithuania</strong>, causing a huge headache for foreign investors in the country.</em></p><p><em>Beijing has chosen a clever tactic. German investors in Lithuania are believed to be urging the government to back down, while polls suggest that Lithuanian public opinion has turned against the Taiwan gambit.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>The CCP&#8217;s reaction to this affair might seem highly disproportionate to the alleged offense, but it is important to consider that only 13 countries plus the Vatican officially recognize Taiwan as a country, and the CCP has been systematically working to bring this number to zero through all manner of coercive actions. Just last month, Nicaragua flipped to the no camp. The CCP views <em><strong>any </strong></em>move against the momentum they are building to squash Taiwan&#8217;s hopes of independence as the deepest of insults that must be met with the harshest of responses. Here&#8217;s how the <em>New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/10/world/asia/taiwan-nicaragua-china.html">describes</a> the situation:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>Now, only 13 nations and the Vatican still recognize Taiwan, <strong>down from 21 in all at the beginning of 2017</strong>. Since then, Panama, the Dominican Republic, Burkina Faso, El Salvador, Kiribati, the Solomon Islands and now Nicaragua have switched their recognition to the People&#8217;s Republic of China. China has sought to keep Taiwan isolated, even barring it from participating in international forums like the World Health Assembly<strong>, in hopes of forcing it to accept unification with the mainland as an inevitability.</strong></em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>For the EU, the CCP&#8217;s bullying of one of its member states presents a significant threat to their credibility as a unified and effective global power. It also puts them in an awkward position, as the continent has more than a half trillion Euros worth of bilateral trade with China, whereas Lithuania is indirectly exposed, accounting for barely 2% of the EU&#8217;s total exports to the country. If the EU tolerates specific and negative trade action against a member state without responding collectively, what is the point of the EU at all? The credibility behind such pledges of unity is now being put to a serious test.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff35f0df6-e05b-4bf1-9e36-d36e4a5bd941_3135x2277.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff35f0df6-e05b-4bf1-9e36-d36e4a5bd941_3135x2277.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff35f0df6-e05b-4bf1-9e36-d36e4a5bd941_3135x2277.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff35f0df6-e05b-4bf1-9e36-d36e4a5bd941_3135x2277.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff35f0df6-e05b-4bf1-9e36-d36e4a5bd941_3135x2277.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff35f0df6-e05b-4bf1-9e36-d36e4a5bd941_3135x2277.png" width="1100" height="799" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f35f0df6-e05b-4bf1-9e36-d36e4a5bd941_3135x2277.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:799,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:436308,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff35f0df6-e05b-4bf1-9e36-d36e4a5bd941_3135x2277.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff35f0df6-e05b-4bf1-9e36-d36e4a5bd941_3135x2277.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff35f0df6-e05b-4bf1-9e36-d36e4a5bd941_3135x2277.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff35f0df6-e05b-4bf1-9e36-d36e4a5bd941_3135x2277.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a></figure></div><p>The tactics used by the CCP are not without risk of backfire. In its <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/coking-gold">high-profile trade war</a> with Australia, China has accomplished little. Australia has since managed to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/03/australia-finds-new-markets-for-coal-barley-amid-china-trade-fight.html">diversify away</a> from China, finding alternative outlets for its valuable natural resources. When China cut Australia off, it merely redirected supply chain flows and <em><strong>made them more robust for Australia</strong></em>, as suppliers that took over Australia&#8217;s China volume left their prior customers short, and Australia merely <em><strong>developed the ability to serve them</strong></em>. The result can only be seen as an embarrassing loss for China and a win for the Aussies, who emerged from the tussle stronger, more unified as a country on the topic of trade with China, and no worse off economically for all of China&#8217;s bluster.</p><p>Early signs of a similar result for the CCP are beginning to develop in Europe, potentially backing them into a corner from which it would be difficult to emerge without losing face. Just this week, Slovenia also allowed Taiwan to open a representative office in its capital under the name &#8220;Taiwan,&#8221; triggering a predictably frothy response:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>China on Wednesday condemned plans by Slovenia to upgrade relations with self-governing Taiwan, a move <strong>likely to spark diplomatic and economic retaliation</strong> against the tiny Central European country.</em></p><p><em>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said China was &#8216;shocked by this and strongly opposed to it,&#8217; but gave no immediate details on how Beijing would respond.</em></p><p><em>&#8216;It is a <strong>dangerous statement</strong> made by the Slovenian leader that overtly challenges the one-China principle and supports Taiwan independence,&#8217; Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing, referring to comments Monday by Slovenia&#8217;s Prime Minister Janez Jansa.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>In a famous <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_how_to_start_a_movement?language=en">presentation</a> by Derek Sivers at TED 2010 titled &#8220;<em>How to start a movement</em>,&#8221; he tells the story of how an entire crowd in a park could be made to <em><strong>collectively</strong></em> dance with joy by the actions of just <em><strong>two</strong></em> people. The video playing behind Sivers as he speaks begins with a shirtless man unilaterally deciding to begin dancing by himself &#8211; a person Sivers labels as the &#8220;lone nut.&#8221; Onlookers have their curiosity piqued by the strange scene, but then something critical happens. A <em><strong>second </strong></em>man joins the lone nut and begins to dance, which simultaneously normalizes the lone nut&#8217;s behavior and signals to others that it is acceptable to join in the party. Sivers call him the &#8220;first follower.&#8221; He continues:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>Now, notice that the leader embraces him as an equal. Now it's not about the leader anymore; <strong>it's about them, plural</strong>. Now, there he is calling to his friends. Now, if you notice that the first follower is actually an underestimated form of leadership in itself. It takes guts to stand out like that. <strong>The first follower is what transforms a lone nut into a leader.</strong> And here comes a second follower. Now it's not a lone nut, it's not two nuts -- three is a crowd, and a crowd is news. So a movement must be public. It's important to show not just the leader, but the followers, because you find that new followers emulate the followers, not the leader. Now, here come two more people, and immediately after, three more people. <strong>Now we've got momentum. This is the tipping point. Now we've got a movement.</strong></em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e110967-90c7-4bc7-baf3-42beaa48bf79_2574x988.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e110967-90c7-4bc7-baf3-42beaa48bf79_2574x988.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e110967-90c7-4bc7-baf3-42beaa48bf79_2574x988.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e110967-90c7-4bc7-baf3-42beaa48bf79_2574x988.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e110967-90c7-4bc7-baf3-42beaa48bf79_2574x988.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e110967-90c7-4bc7-baf3-42beaa48bf79_2574x988.png" width="1100" height="422" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5e110967-90c7-4bc7-baf3-42beaa48bf79_2574x988.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:422,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3719669,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e110967-90c7-4bc7-baf3-42beaa48bf79_2574x988.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e110967-90c7-4bc7-baf3-42beaa48bf79_2574x988.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e110967-90c7-4bc7-baf3-42beaa48bf79_2574x988.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e110967-90c7-4bc7-baf3-42beaa48bf79_2574x988.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a></figure></div><p>It is too soon to tell whether Lithuania is the lone nut and Slovenia the first follower that triggers a foot-stomping dance party on the CCP&#8217;s credibility, but the coming days and weeks will be telling.</p><p>We close this article by contemplating the origin story of this entire affair. Why did Lithuania, a relative pawn on the geopolitical chess board, make such a bold move in the first place? For clues, we turn to a <a href="https://www.fpri.org/article/2021/07/reconceptualizing-lithuanias-importance-for-u-s-foreign-policy/">fantastic report</a> by the <em>Foreign Policy Research Institute</em> titled &#8220;<em>Reconceptualizing Lithuania&#8217;s Importance for U.S. Foreign Policy.&#8221;</em> In it, author Nikolas Gvosdev walks readers through the complex history of the relationship between the US and Lithuania, how the robustness of Lithuania&#8217;s security as an independent state relies heavily on support from the US, and how the nature of that support has ebbed and flowed with how the US views the strategic importance of the region in which Lithuania is situated. When containing Russia is the top priority of the US, Lithuania increases in importance, which strengthens the bilateral relationship between the countries. When the attention of the US turns to containing China, Lithuania risks being left to fend for itself.</p><p>You can probably fill in the rest.</p><p><em><strong>If you enjoyed this piece, please do

A plumber came to mean a person dealing in and working with lead, which eventually evolved to the modern understanding we ascribe to the word today. <em>Plumbum</em> is also why the chemical symbol for lead is Pb.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87d99fd8-a3e7-4783-8456-f6aefe76859a_600x1020.jpeg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87d99fd8-a3e7-4783-8456-f6aefe76859a_600x1020.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87d99fd8-a3e7-4783-8456-f6aefe76859a_600x1020.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87d99fd8-a3e7-4783-8456-f6aefe76859a_600x1020.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87d99fd8-a3e7-4783-8456-f6aefe76859a_600x1020.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87d99fd8-a3e7-4783-8456-f6aefe76859a_600x1020.jpeg" width="536" height="911.2" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/87d99fd8-a3e7-4783-8456-f6aefe76859a_600x1020.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1020,&quot;width&quot;:600,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:536,&quot;bytes&quot;:224139,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87d99fd8-a3e7-4783-8456-f6aefe76859a_600x1020.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87d99fd8-a3e7-4783-8456-f6aefe76859a_600x1020.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87d99fd8-a3e7-4783-8456-f6aefe76859a_600x1020.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87d99fd8-a3e7-4783-8456-f6aefe76859a_600x1020.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Lead pipe in Rome | photo credit &#169;gds, CC BY-SA 2.0</figcaption></figure></div><p>Lead is cheap, relatively abundant, easily worked, and corrosion resistant. It has been used in myriad applications throughout history. Nonetheless, lead has one significant drawback &#8211; it is extremely toxic to humans. Prolonged exposure to high levels of lead can lead to anemia, cardiovascular issues, stomach pains, severe mental disorders, and death. Because lead interferes with reproduction and brain development, it is especially toxic to fetuses, babies, and young children, where even low levels of exposure can lead to reduced IQs, stunted growth, and behavioral issues.</p><p>The toxicity of lead has been known for ages and was particularly well understood by the early part of the 20th century, which makes the conspiracy we are about to describe especially insidious. As laid bare in an explosive and extremely well researched series of articles <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/secret-history-lead/">published</a> by <em>The Nation</em> more than 20 years ago, General Motors (GM), DuPont, and Standard Oil of New Jersey (the predecessor to today&#8217;s Exxon Mobil) knowingly engaged in commercially lucrative but legally and morally outrageous behavior that resulted in one of the greatest environmental catastrophes of modern times. The details of what transpired should shock even the most ardent supporters of unfettered free market capitalism into understanding why prudent environmental regulations are in the public&#8217;s interest.</p><p>In the early part of the 1920s, the race was on to discover and profit from the dominant technologies that would underpin the already-booming automotive industry. Although internal combustion engines (ICEs) powered by gasoline had many advantages over the competition &#8211; an excellent mix of speed, power, and range &#8211; there did exist one critical flaw. Because the gasoline on the market at that time was of relatively poor quality, ICEs tended to &#8220;knock.&#8221; Knocking occurs when gasoline burns unevenly inside an engine&#8217;s cylinders, resulting in unpleasant noises, reduced range, and accelerated engine degradation. The solution was to upgrade the octane rating of gasoline &#8211; a standard measure of a fuel's ability to withstand compression in an ICE without detonating &#8211; and a frantic search occurred for a suitable chemical additive that could solve the problem.</p><p>In truth, a perfectly viable solution already existed, but none of the three corporations at the heart of this story were much interested in it. It was widely understood, even back then, that blending modest concentrations of ethanol with gasoline not only solved knocking, but it also produced an outstanding motor fuel by the technical measures that mattered. GM and DuPont &#8211; which effectively owned a controlling interest in GM during the relevant period &#8211; were opposed to the use of ethanol in gasoline because they couldn&#8217;t profit from it. Meanwhile, the big oil companies vehemently opposed ethanol because they viewed it as a dangerously competitive alternative to gasoline altogether. Strangling the burgeoning ethanol industry while it was still in its cradle was a top strategic priority for all parties.</p><p>Enter tetraethyl lead.</p><p>The discovery that highly poisonous tetraethyl lead (TEL) was an extraordinarily effective anti-knocking agent was made in late 1921 by Thomas Midgley Jr., working in the research laboratory of Charles Kettering. Over the next seven decades, GM, DuPont, Standard Oil of New Jersey, and various related corporate entities that sprung from this development like Ethyl Gasoline Corporation engaged in an orgy of lies, deceit, corruption, and coverup. To their everlasting shame, they brazenly paid for knowingly bad science, exaggerated the uniqueness of their invention, bent the powers of the US government to help them secure first a domestic and eventually a global domination of the gasoline additive market, downplayed the dozens of employee deaths that resulted from exposure to TEL, ignored direct evidence of the toxic legacy they were creating, litigated against and worked to stall all opposition to their malfeasance, and literally saturated the Earth with lead oxide particles spewed from virtually every tailpipe on the road. Their collective behavior was unabashedly grotesque, and the resulting harm entirely avoidable.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22583060-2a8f-44f6-a494-28c24ebd6b50_840x600.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22583060-2a8f-44f6-a494-28c24ebd6b50_840x600.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22583060-2a8f-44f6-a494-28c24ebd6b50_840x600.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22583060-2a8f-44f6-a494-28c24ebd6b50_840x600.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22583060-2a8f-44f6-a494-28c24ebd6b50_840x600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22583060-2a8f-44f6-a494-28c24ebd6b50_840x600.png" width="618" height="441.42857142857144" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/22583060-2a8f-44f6-a494-28c24ebd6b50_840x600.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:600,&quot;width&quot;:840,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:618,&quot;bytes&quot;:388365,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22583060-2a8f-44f6-a494-28c24ebd6b50_840x600.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22583060-2a8f-44f6-a494-28c24ebd6b50_840x600.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22583060-2a8f-44f6-a494-28c24ebd6b50_840x600.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22583060-2a8f-44f6-a494-28c24ebd6b50_840x600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Ethyl Gasoline Corporation advertisement</figcaption></figure></div><p>With air and water pollution reaching an unacceptable apex in the US, President Richard Nixon oversaw passage of the <em>Clean Air Act of 1970</em> and the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which was given a broad mandate and substantial enforcement authority. Among the EPA&#8217;s first targets was TEL, but it took <em><strong>another 25 years</strong></em> before its use in US passenger vehicle gasoline was finally and fully eradicated. The introduction and proliferation of catalytic converters to meet other pollution goals set by the EPA was a considerable driver of the phase out of TEL, since lead acts as a severe poison to the catalysts used in such devices.</p><p>In the intervening period, the industry searched for lead-free anti-knock additives but once again took a pass on ethanol, settling instead for methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). This time, ethanol was ruled out because vehicle engines weren&#8217;t yet designed to be compatible with it. Although solving these compatibility issues was a relatively simple task involving modest changes to alloys used and the substitution of certain gaskets and seals, MTBE was an effective and affordable drop-in solution that could be produced at the necessary scale. And thus, drivers were introduced to the concept of &#8220;unleaded&#8221; gasoline, largely unaware of the fraudulent claims and profit motive that put the harmful substance in their cars in the first place.</p><p>Unfortunately, MTBE itself had a fatal flaw &#8211; it is a dangerously toxic water pollutant. It spreads underground faster than other components of gasoline and is highly soluble in water. After several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTBE_controversy">high-profile leaks</a> from underground gasoline storage tanks, the molecule was banned for use as an anti-knock agent in the US and several other developed countries. &nbsp;</p><p>And so, finally, nearly 85 years after the regrettable discovery and widespread adoption of TEL as an anti-knocking agent, it was back to square one. Congress solved the problem by enacting the Renewable Fuels Standard in 2005 and expanded it in 2007, which mandated the use of ethanol derived from corn as an additive in gasoline. Today, nearly all gasoline in the US contains ethanol, with the three dominant blends being E10, E15, and E85 (the numbers represent the percentage of ethanol in the blend).

Additionally, the carbon dioxide generated during fermentation is captured and used for carbonating beverages and in the manufacturing of dry ice. &nbsp;The price per gallon of ethanol is quite competitive with gasoline, even correcting for its lower energy content and assigning <em><strong>zero value</strong></em> to its role as an anti-knock agent.

Using food for fuel is ethically dubious. Ethanol plants are limited in scale because the feedstock is of low density and widely dispersed, constraining the radius of economic feasibility when sizing new facilities. The corn belt has disproportionate power over the US Senate, and corn ethanol would never have been adopted absent this peculiarity of US domestic politics. There are alternative anti-knock solutions like requiring oil refineries to produce higher octane gasoline directly.</p><p>Yes, these are all valid critiques, worthy of thoughtful debate. But they also serve what we believe is a deeper and more nefarious propaganda objective. A standard trick of the public relations trade when confronting a terrible narrative like the ugly legacy of leaded gasoline is to <em><strong>divert attention to other problems,</strong></em> <em><strong>no matter the problem</strong></em>. By creating and stoking a debate about corn ethanol as a <em><strong>fuel</strong></em>, your attention is diverted away from its primary role as an <em><strong>anti-knocking</strong></em> additive. The goal is to get you to forget about the ugly history of TEL. The fact that you are likely learning about much of this for the first time by reading the peckings of a green chicken on Substack is proof of the efficacy of this magic trick.</p><p>The <em>Wikipedia</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol_fuel_in_the_United_States">page</a> for &#8220;Ethanol fuel in the United States&#8221; is comprehensive, containing more than 12,000 and words and 176 footnotes. The word &#8220;fuel&#8221; shows up 268 times. Absent from the page? The words &#8220;MBTE,&#8221; &#8220;lead,&#8221; and &#8220;knock.&#8221; The same could be said for countless news articles, speeches and campaigns on the subject.</p><p>Omissions that speak volumes.</p><p><em><strong>If you enjoyed this piece, please do us the HUGE favor of simply clicking the LIKE button!</strong></em></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://doomberg.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://doomberg.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://doomberg.substack.com/p/in-praise-of-corn-ethanol?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/in-praise-of-corn-ethanol?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86260f17-7b72-4c87-b7cb-3d4bad9ff2a2_840x600.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86260f17-7b72-4c87-b7cb-3d4bad9ff2a2_840x600.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86260f17-7b72-4c87-b7cb-3d4bad9ff2a2_840x600.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86260f17-7b72-4c87-b7cb-3d4bad9ff2a2_840x600.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86260f17-7b72-4c87-b7cb-3d4bad9ff2a2_840x600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86260f17-7b72-4c87-b7cb-3d4bad9ff2a2_840x600.png" width="840" height="600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/86260f17-7b72-4c87-b7cb-3d4bad9ff2a2_840x600.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:600,&quot;width&quot;:840,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:642608,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86260f17-7b72-4c87-b7cb-3d4bad9ff2a2_840x600.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86260f17-7b72-4c87-b7cb-3d4bad9ff2a2_840x600.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86260f17-7b72-4c87-b7cb-3d4bad9ff2a2_840x600.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86260f17-7b72-4c87-b7cb-3d4bad9ff2a2_840x600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a></figure></div>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Political Hamburglars]]></title><description><![CDATA[The response to the pandemic destroyed countless small businesses &#8211;

He owns them beforehand.</em>&#8221; - George C. Henderson</p><p>Beginning in the fall of 1978 and continuing for a period of 10 months, Hillary Clinton was simultaneously the First Lady of the State of Arkansas, a busy partner in a powerful local law firm, a respected member of various boards, and perhaps the world&#8217;s greatest trader of sophisticated cattle futures contracts. Starting with a meager opening deposit of $1,000, Clinton had an incredible knack for catching favorable fills near the highs and/or lows of the day <em><strong>and</strong></em> a savant-like ability to short cattle futures during a raging bull market (pun intended). She parlayed her small stake and good fortune into $99,541 before she cashed out and left the rodeo. This was a handsome sum in 1979 &#8211; approximately four times the annual salary she collected as a lawyer.</p><p>In a comprehensive and humorous investigation first <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/06/hillary-clinton-cattle-futures-windfall/">published</a> by the <em>National Review</em> in early 2015, the mystery of Mrs. Clinton&#8217;s seemingly precocious trading abilities is unraveled for all but the most partisan eyes to see. Her &#8220;advisor&#8221; on these trades was none other than James Blair, whose day job at the time was General Counsel of Tyson Foods, the Arkansas-based meat packing giant with much important business under consideration by then Governor Bill Clinton. The broker who executed her orders was a former Tyson employee with a perfect name, Red Bone &#8211; a man who was disciplined by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) for sloppy record keeping in the same year Mrs. Clinton realized her windfall. As far as schemes to funnel money to powerful politicians go, this episode is notable for its brazenness, but in the pantheon of accusations of corruption that have dogged the Clintons for decades, it is a mostly-forgotten footnote.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e38fdbd-9e88-4656-998f-92d446363e8b_1600x1107.jpeg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e38fdbd-9e88-4656-998f-92d446363e8b_1600x1107.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e38fdbd-9e88-4656-998f-92d446363e8b_1600x1107.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e38fdbd-9e88-4656-998f-92d446363e8b_1600x1107.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e38fdbd-9e88-4656-998f-92d446363e8b_1600x1107.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e38fdbd-9e88-4656-998f-92d446363e8b_1600x1107.jpeg" width="1100" height="761" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8e38fdbd-9e88-4656-998f-92d446363e8b_1600x1107.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:761,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:307818,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e38fdbd-9e88-4656-998f-92d446363e8b_1600x1107.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e38fdbd-9e88-4656-998f-92d446363e8b_1600x1107.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e38fdbd-9e88-4656-998f-92d446363e8b_1600x1107.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e38fdbd-9e88-4656-998f-92d446363e8b_1600x1107.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Photo credit: Getty Images</figcaption></figure></div><p>If politicians were forced to wear the corporate logos of their deep-pocketed sponsors in the way that golfers and race car drivers do, Tyson&#8217;s red and yellow badge would have undoubtedly occupied a prominent place on the Clintons&#8217; golf attire, and almost certainly adorned the prized real estate on the hood of their race car.</p><p>The Clintons are hardly unique in this way.</p><p>Veterans of the chemical industry used to jokingly refer to the current President as Senator Joseph Biden (D &#8211; DuPont). Or consider Robert Caro&#8217;s outstanding series of biographies on Lyndon Johnson.&nbsp; In the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Path-Power-Years-Lyndon-Johnson/dp/0679729453">first</a> of these classics called <em>The Path to Power</em>, Caro lays bare the unseemly role construction and engineering giant Brown &amp; Root played in enabling Johnson&#8217;s political career, and the huge amount of government largesse Johnson sent their way in return. Lest the reader think we focus only on Democrats, consider that Brown &amp; Root eventually became a subsidiary of Halliburton, which was presumably thrilled when then-CEO and Chair Dick Cheney ascended to the lofty position of Vice President of the United States in 2000. <em>Plus &#231;a change.</em></p><p>Given the toxicity of the 2008 Democratic primary between Barack Obama and Mrs. Clinton, and the number of former Obama staffers that occupy important positions in the current Biden administration, one could be forgiven for viewing Biden&#8217;s recent assault on the meat packing industry through an overtly political lens. Frankly, our initial instinct was to assume the attention from the Oval Office was a combination of political payback, a measure of the ever-falling influence of the Clinton&#8217;s over the Democratic Party, and a convenient scapegoat for Biden that could be used to deflect blame for the burst of inflation winding its way through the US economy. Here&#8217;s how Biden framed the problem in a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/03/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-action-plan-for-a-fairer-more-competitive-and-more-resilient-meat-and-poultry-supply-chain/">recent statement</a> (emphasis added throughout this piece; the big four meat packing companies Biden refers to are the aforementioned Tyson Foods, Cargill, Brazil-based JBS SA, and National Beef Packing Co.):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em><strong>Four large meat-packing companies control 85 percent of the beef market</strong>. In poultry, the top four processing firms control 54 percent of the market. And in pork, the top four processing firms control about 70 percent of the market. The meatpackers and processors buy from farmers and sell to retailers like grocery stores, making them <strong>a key bottleneck in the food supply chain.</strong></em></p><p><em>When <strong>dominant middlemen</strong> control so much of the supply chain, they can increase their own profits at the expense of both farmers&#8212;who make less&#8212;and consumers&#8212;who pay more. Most farmers now have little or no choice of buyer for their product and little leverage to negotiate, causing their share of every dollar spent on food to decline. Fifty years ago, ranchers got over 60 cents of every dollar a consumer spent on beef, compared to about 39 cents today. Similarly, hog farmers got 40 to 60 cents on each dollar spent 50 years ago, down to about 19 cents today.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>We reconsidered our initial dismissal of the affair &#8211; and decided to cut into the steak ourselves &#8211; after coming across an excellent piece on the topic by Matt Stoller, author of the popular Substack <em>BIG</em>. (You can subscribe to Stoller&#8217;s Substack <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/">here</a> and follow his thoughtful Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewstoller">here</a>.) Stoller views the growth of monopolistic power in the US as an existential threat to the country and has dedicated his professional career to fighting against it. Stoller tackles the meat packing controversy head on in a blunt <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/economists-to-cattle-ranchers-stop">article</a> called <em>Economists to Cattle Ranchers: Stop Being So Emotional About the Monopolies Devouring Your Family Businesses</em>. &#173;&#173;&#173;&#173;&#173;</p><p>Stoller begins by noting the growing disparity between the decreasing price paid for cattle and the increasing price paid for wholesale beef, the difference being the growing margins of the meat packers. He then goes on to catalogue how the meat packing market became so concentrated, the impact of consolidation and plant closures on the rancher&#8217;s ability to monetize their cattle, and the shift in the way meat packers acquire cattle for slaughter. Stoller&#8217;s core accusation is that the big four meat packers have conspired to weaken and then manipulate the cash auctions market for cattle to illegally drive down price. Here&#8217;s a key passage:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>Ranchers suspect that the Big Four have been fixing prices to lower what they get paid. <strong>This market-rigging took place over time, as the packers gradually forced changes in how cattle markets work.</strong> Traditionally, cattle ranchers had sold their cattle at open cash markets where they would display their cows, and packers would bid for them. It was a rich, thick market, with information about prices displayed very clearly to buyers and sellers. Such markets are hard to rig.</em></p><p><em>But in the mid-2000s, packers began using what are called <strong>captive supply deals</strong>. Under a captive supply deal, a rancher signs a contract with a packer. He will no longer take his cattle to an open market, but will raise it and sell it to that buyer. Basically, ranchers get a guaranteed sale, while packers get a guaranteed source of cattle. Or that&#8217;s the theory. Because there&#8217;s still the matter of price. To figure out what the packer should pay, these deals usually just say that the packer has to pay whatever the price is in the normal open cash market&#8230;</em></p><p><em><strong>The cash market, now just 20% of all sales</strong>, became what is known as &#8216;thin,&#8217; meaning there&#8217;s a lot less bought and sold. Thin markets are a lot easier to manipulate; a buyer could just pull out of an auction. <strong>That doesn&#8217;t just lower the price paid in that cash market, but also the cash price for all the captive supply contracts as well.</strong></em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>For its part, Tyson forcibly <a href="https://ir.tyson.com/news/news-details/2021/Tyson-Foods-Categorically-Rejects-Conclusions-Drawn-by-White-House/default.aspx">rejects</a> accusations of illegal behavior and instead pins the blame for the swoon in cattle prices on unexpected market shocks &#8211; especially the Covid-19 pandemic but also a series of severe weather incidents &#8211; which led to worker shortages and an inability to process cattle at historical rates. This occurred just as demand for beef in the US and abroad was at record levels, leading to the natural and concurrent outcome of higher prices.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Miller%20-%20Testimony.pdf">testimony</a> before Congress, Shane Miller, Group President of Tyson Fresh Meats, argued that the quality, variety, safety, and affordability of meat in the US is proof that the market is working. &nbsp;Here&#8217;s Miller driving home that point:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>To be clear, <strong>at Tyson, we welcome competition</strong>. Healthy competition not only makes us better &#8211; it also helps put affordable, higher-quality food on the tables of more Americans.</em></p><p><em>And the competition is intense. Customers have multiple meat suppliers from which to choose and they subject suppliers to competitive bidding processes based on terms the customers specify. Customers often work with several meat suppliers to ensure orders are filled according to their product specifications, volume requirements, and pricing terms, which adds to the constant pressure to outperform the competition.</em></p><p><em>Evidence of healthy competition can also be found by looking at historical outcomes. For example, we have seen a rise in availability and quality of beef, while the price has become more affordable over the past quarter-century: <strong>data shows that while the concentration of the industry has remained relatively constant for close to 30 years, quality has significantly improved.</strong></em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Inspection of Tyson&#8217;s latest financial results would seem to lend credibility to Stoller&#8217;s argument and undercut Miller&#8217;s. Tyson&#8217;s 2021 fiscal fourth quarter ended in early October, and the results for their Beef segment are practically sizzling. As shown in the screen capture below, taken from the company&#8217;s presentation to investors, Tyson&#8217;s Beef segment raised price by an <em><strong>astonishing 35.2%</strong></em> in the quarter versus prior year, which more than compensated for an 8.8% decrease in volume. Additionally, the segment&#8217;s operating margin <em><strong>more than doubled to 22.9%</strong></em> of revenue. In the cutthroat food business, such margins are rare indeed.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3a64fb-2dbb-4894-ac3a-4dd0b5cb0bdc_1759x1337.jpeg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3a64fb-2dbb-4894-ac3a-4dd0b5cb0bdc_1759x1337.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3a64fb-2dbb-4894-ac3a-4dd0b5cb0bdc_1759x1337.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3a64fb-2dbb-4894-ac3a-4dd0b5cb0bdc_1759x1337.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3a64fb-2dbb-4894-ac3a-4dd0b5cb0bdc_1759x1337.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3a64fb-2dbb-4894-ac3a-4dd0b5cb0bdc_1759x1337.jpeg" width="616" height="468.16" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1e3a64fb-2dbb-4894-ac3a-4dd0b5cb0bdc_1759x1337.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:836,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:616,&quot;bytes&quot;:271615,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3a64fb-2dbb-4894-ac3a-4dd0b5cb0bdc_1759x1337.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3a64fb-2dbb-4894-ac3a-4dd0b5cb0bdc_1759x1337.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3a64fb-2dbb-4894-ac3a-4dd0b5cb0bdc_1759x1337.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3a64fb-2dbb-4894-ac3a-4dd0b5cb0bdc_1759x1337.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a></figure></div><p>We interviewed several ranchers and other experts in the agricultural space in the course of our own research &#8211; none of whom would go on the record. In some instances, ranchers expressed specific concern about triggering blowback from the big four meat processors &#8211; a sign that at least some anticompetitive behavior is indeed occurring. We were able to question ranchers with small and large operations alike and received substantial input from a commodities broker with decades of knowledge and extensive contacts in the industry. Overall, our findings paint a mixed picture.</p><p>We begin with the fact that the beef market is global and focusing exclusively on US numbers gives an incomplete view of the overall situation. Certain cuts of beef are regularly imported, while others are exported to meet specific local demand. This is somewhat analogous to how different grades of crude are traded around the world based on unique refinery capabilities. Also, demand for protein is booming overseas, and the larger ranchers with better channel contacts can more easily capitalize on this trend, whereas smaller ranchers are left to fight it out with the big four.</p><p>In the past few years, an ongoing and historic drought in Australia forced ranchers with decimated pastures to prematurely liquidate their herds, leading to a temporary burst of supply. While this disruption certainly hasn&#8217;t helped US ranchers, the effects should be transient. Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-31/breeding-cows-go-to-slaughter-as-drought-sees-properties-run-dry/11655094">report</a> from late 2019 which described the desperate situation in the Land Down Under:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>Generations of Australia's <strong>prime breeding cows are heading to slaughterhouses</strong> as a lack of water and feed sees more producers opt to &#8216;cash in and get out&#8217;. Almost 100,000 female cattle have been sold collectively in New South Wales at saleyards in Scone, Singleton, Tamworth, Gunnedah and Dubbo this year alone&#8230;</em></p><p><em><strong>Cattle breeders and agents are concerned about the national herd diminishing and how breeding lines will be rebuilt once the drought breaks.</strong></em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Additionally, and with more structural significance, the value chain for cattle has evolved such that ranchers rarely sell directly to meat packers. Instead, there exist specialized operations that acquire cattle in certain weight ranges, bulk them up by a few hundred pounds, and sell them on to the next node in the system. A calf raised by a rancher might be sold to what&#8217;s known as a <em><strong>backgrounder</strong></em>, who converts them into feeder cattle. When the desired weight is achieved, the backgrounder then sells their feeder cattle to <em><strong>feed yards</strong></em>, who bring the cattle up to slaughter weight in close collaboration with meat packers, who set detailed specifications for the cattle they&#8217;d prefer. Once at weight, the cattle become known colloquially as fat cattle, or more formally as live cattle, which is ironic given what comes next.

Here&#8217;s a direct quote:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>The beef industry has been changing over the past 5-10 years.&nbsp; The quality specifications of the cattle that are deliverable against the CME Live Cattle futures contract are no longer the standard for cattle that the packers are demanding, therefore the hedging mechanism doesn't work the way it did in years past.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>This lack of a natural buyer is particularly true for the CME Live Cattle contract, which makes sense when you consider who is taking risks and for how long. The feed yards own cattle for several months and are exposed to all manner of input costs with substantial volatility, whereas the meat packers acquire live cattle just prior to slaughter. When the feed yards hedge, they sell the CME Live Cattle contract, but there&#8217;s less urgency for meat packers to get on the other side of their trade. When a market has more sellers than buyers, lower prices usually follow.</p><p>Stoller would likely argue that these are all symptoms of the broader disease of too much concentration among the meat packers, and the specific means by which this power manifests itself don&#8217;t matter all that much. A credible counterargument is that nearly <em><strong>all markets</strong></em> become more granular, specialized, and concentrated over time, which drives efficiency, lowers costs, and creates better value for end consumers. Larger corporations are more able to navigate these trends, and the crowding out of smaller players as markets mature is a universal and desired <em><strong>feature</strong></em> of the economy &#8211; a form of creative destruction.</p><p>Starbucks crushed many mom-and-pop coffee shops. Walmart did the same to small department and grocery stores alike. Local hardware stores have been largely replaced by Lowe&#8217;s and Home Depot. The response to the pandemic destroyed countless small businesses, much to the advantage of giants like Amazon. One wonders why so much attention is being selectively paid to the plight of the small rancher. The senator most responsible for pushing this issue is Max Baucus of Montana, Biden&#8217;s longtime Democratic colleague and ally in the Senate. It wouldn&#8217;t surprise us if Baucus sold Biden&#8217;s team on the usefulness of this issue as a political deflection point for the inflation challenges facing the administration.</p><p>Naturally, Baucus&#8217; family runs the famous Sieben Ranch in Helena, Montana. <em>Plus c'est la m&#234;me chose.</em></p><p><em><strong>If you enjoyed this piece, please do us the HUGE favor of simply clicking the LIKE button!</strong></em></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://doomberg.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://doomberg.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://doomberg.substack.com/p/political-hamburglars?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/political-hamburglars?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f9d33c2-2429-45ac-bd81-080e1300c9ff_840x600.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f9d33c2-2429-45ac-bd81-080e1300c9ff_840x600.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f9d33c2-2429-45ac-bd81-080e1300c9ff_840x600.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f9d33c2-2429-45ac-bd81-080e1300c9ff_840x600.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f9d33c2-2429-45ac-bd81-080e1300c9ff_840x600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f9d33c2-2429-45ac-bd81-080e1300c9ff_840x600.png" width="840" height="600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7f9d33c2-2429-45ac-bd81-080e1300c9ff_840x600.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:600,&quot;width&quot;:840,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:544624,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f9d33c2-2429-45ac-bd81-080e1300c9ff_840x600.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f9d33c2-2429-45ac-bd81-080e1300c9ff_840x600.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f9d33c2-2429-45ac-bd81-080e1300c9ff_840x600.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f9d33c2-2429-45ac-bd81-080e1300c9ff_840x600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a></figure></div>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Banana Worth Squeezing]]></title><description><![CDATA[The EU ETS carbon emissions scheme is, in effect, a HODL Mechanism&#8482;.&#160;

&#8211; Lawson Steele</p><p>On Friday, October 24, 2008, Volkswagen&#8217;s (VW) stock closed at EUR 210 per share, down 50% over the prior two weeks. Like many manufacturing companies, VW was reeling from the global financial crisis. Because of its high debt load and diminishing prospects, the stock was a popular pick among short sellers and approximately 13% of the total shares outstanding were sold short. That might not seem like a very high number, but as a percent of the company&#8217;s free float it was substantial. At that time, Porsche owned 42.6% of VW&#8217;s shares and the German state of Lower Saxony held 20.3%. </p><p>On Sunday, October 26, 2008, Porsche issued <a href="https://www.porsche-se.com/en/news/press-releases/details/news/detail/News/porsche-heads-for-domination-agreement-1">a press release</a> that would kick off one of the most famous short squeezes of all time. Here&#8217;s how the English version of the release began (emphasis added through this piece):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>Due to the dramatic distortions on the financial markets Porsche Automobil Holding SE, Stuttgart, has decided over the weekend to disclose its holdings in shares and hedging positions related to the takeover of Volkswagen AG, Wolfsburg. At the end of last week Porsche SE held 42.6 percent of the Volkswagen ordinary shares and in addition 31.5 percent in so called cash settled options relating to Volkswagen ordinary shares to hedge against price risks, <strong>representing a total of 74.1 percent</strong>. Upon settlement of these options Porsche will receive in cash the difference between the then actual Volkswagen share price and the underlying strike price in cash. <strong>The Volkswagen shares will be bought in each case at market price.</strong></em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Further down in the same press release, Porsche lays bare their motivations and strategy with classic German humor:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>Porsche has decided to make this announcement after it became clear that <strong>there are by far more short positions in the market than expected</strong>. The disclosure should give so called short sellers - meaning financial institutions which have betted or are still betting on a falling share price in Volkswagen - <strong>the opportunity to settle their relevant positions without rush and without facing major risks</strong>.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>It doesn&#8217;t take a PhD in mathematics to understand that if Porsche claims to own 74.1% of VW and Lower Saxony has 20.3%, that leaves only 5.6% for everybody else. With short sellers on the hook to buy back 13% of the shares outstanding, panic buying in an effort to close out their short positions ensued. VW&#8217;s stock soared in the days following Porsche&#8217;s audacious gambit &#8211; at one point crossing EUR 1,000 per share &#8211; temporarily making the struggling automaker the most valuable company in the world. The crisis abated when Porsche announced it would close a portion of its option position, thereby freeing up float for short sellers to cover. Market participants lost billions in the fiasco, and there&#8217;s no telling where the price of VW might have risen absent Porsche&#8217;s opening of the release valve.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e4ccd11-029a-49f4-9df8-38039bfd4137_2878x1358.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e4ccd11-029a-49f4-9df8-38039bfd4137_2878x1358.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e4ccd11-029a-49f4-9df8-38039bfd4137_2878x1358.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e4ccd11-029a-49f4-9df8-38039bfd4137_2878x1358.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e4ccd11-029a-49f4-9df8-38039bfd4137_2878x1358.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e4ccd11-029a-49f4-9df8-38039bfd4137_2878x1358.png" width="1100" height="519" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9e4ccd11-029a-49f4-9df8-38039bfd4137_2878x1358.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:519,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:714930,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e4ccd11-029a-49f4-9df8-38039bfd4137_2878x1358.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e4ccd11-029a-49f4-9df8-38039bfd4137_2878x1358.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e4ccd11-029a-49f4-9df8-38039bfd4137_2878x1358.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e4ccd11-029a-49f4-9df8-38039bfd4137_2878x1358.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a></figure></div><p>As argued in this outstanding and comprehensive <a href="https://www.sfi.ch/en/publications/market-efficiency-and-limits-to-arbitrage-evidence-from-the-volkswagen-short-squeeze">research paper</a> published just months ago in the <em>Journal of Financial Economics</em>, Porsche&#8217;s move was blatant and plainly illegal stock manipulation driven by their own looming insolvency. Ironically, Porsche&#8217;s bankruptcy risk arose from the very same options strategy it bragged about in its press release, although a critical detail went undisclosed: to pay for its call options in VW, Porsche <em><strong>had sold put options</strong></em> on the stock. As VW&#8217;s stock fell in the weeks prior to the infamous press release, Porsche faced a series of margin calls as those puts went in the money. If it had fallen much further, Porsche would have defaulted on its obligations. Instead, Porsche pocketed at least EURO 6 billion in illicit gains from the squeeze, turning a catastrophic and undisclosed trading blunder into a windfall.</p><p>Short squeezes are a hot topic in today&#8217;s frothy markets, which is ironic given how few short sellers are left standing. This is especially true with meme stonk AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC), which we&#8217;ve written about <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/super-stonks-amc-entertainment-holdings">here</a> and <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/no-planet-for-the-apes">here</a>. There&#8217;s an entire cult of retail investors &#8211; the self-described AMC apes &#8211; who are conspiring together in the hopes of recreating a VW-like frenzy in what they call the mother of all short squeezes (MOASS). No really, MOASS is a thing. Find your way onto their Twitter Spaces &#8220;conference calls&#8221; and you&#8217;ll hear talk of dark pools, evil hedge funds, and various other theories concocted to rationalize why this squeeze has thus far failed to materialize. </p><p>Putting aside the fact that conspiring to manipulate the price of any security is illegal &#8211; even for a group of retail investors openly doing it on social media for all the authorities to see &#8211; we submit that <em><strong>the apes are chasing the wrong banana</strong></em>, because the real MOASS might well unfold in Europe in the coming months.</p><p>We tell the VW short squeeze story &#8211; and direct the apes to turn their attention to Europe &#8211; because we were reminded of both when we listened to this spellbinding <a href="https://anchor.fm/chris-dark/episodes/2-3-Carbon-Credits---A-New-Asset-Class--with-Lawson-Steele-e1c0vns">edition</a> of Chris Dark&#8217;s fantastic podcast <em>Dr Dark After Dark</em>. Dark interviewed Lawson Steele, a Senior Analyst at Berenberg Bank who has covered utilities for nearly three decades. In early 2018, Steele made a prescient call on where he thought the price of <em><strong>carbon credits</strong></em> was headed in Europe. Since he got long the trade, the price of those credits is up twelvefold, and he makes a compelling case for why this may be just the beginning. You can follow Dark&#8217;s Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/Darky999">here</a> and Steele&#8217;s account <a href="https://twitter.com/LawsonSteele3">here</a>.</p><p>The European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) is designed to leverage market forces to achieve the EU&#8217;s aggressive emissions reduction targets, specifically its commitment to reduce carbon emissions 55% by 2030 (from the 1990 base). Here&#8217;s a relatively benign overview of the system from <em>Wikipedia</em>:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>Under the &#8216;cap and trade&#8217; principle, a maximum (cap) is set on the total amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted by all participating installations. <strong>EU Allowances for emissions</strong> are then auctioned off or allocated for free and <strong>can subsequently be traded</strong>. Installations must monitor and report their CO2 emissions, ensuring they hand in enough allowances to the authorities to cover their emissions. <strong>If emission exceeds what is permitted by its allowances, an installation must purchase allowances from others</strong>. Conversely, if an installation has performed well at reducing its emissions, it can sell its leftover credits. This allows the system to find the most cost-effective ways of reducing emissions without significant government intervention.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>This all sounds well and good, but, as Lawson describes, there appears to be a significant flaw in the design of the EU ETS: emitters are net short and the free float is shrinking. </p><p>Integrated across the European economy, companies are emitting far more CO2 than allowed by their ever-more-aggressive targets, and Lawson sees the situation getting worse in the years ahead. If a company has emitted more than the number of allowances it owns, it <em><strong>must</strong></em> go into the open market and procure more. If it fails to do so by the annual deadline of April 30, two things happen. First, the company must pay a fine of EURO 110 for each allowance shortfall, and &#8211; most critically &#8211; paying this fine <em><strong>does not alleviate its obligation to deliver the allowances!</strong></em> The obligation merely rolls forward to the next period, thus <em><strong>increasing</strong></em> the demand for next period&#8217;s limited allowances. Naturally, the market has begun to digest this dynamic and the price of these credits has soared, although they still trade well below this EURO 110 fine.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe84c871c-a687-4bd6-a328-bfcb708b1b8f_2870x1478.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe84c871c-a687-4bd6-a328-bfcb708b1b8f_2870x1478.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe84c871c-a687-4bd6-a328-bfcb708b1b8f_2870x1478.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe84c871c-a687-4bd6-a328-bfcb708b1b8f_2870x1478.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe84c871c-a687-4bd6-a328-bfcb708b1b8f_2870x1478.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe84c871c-a687-4bd6-a328-bfcb708b1b8f_2870x1478.png" width="1100" height="566" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e84c871c-a687-4bd6-a328-bfcb708b1b8f_2870x1478.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:566,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:884618,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe84c871c-a687-4bd6-a328-bfcb708b1b8f_2870x1478.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe84c871c-a687-4bd6-a328-bfcb708b1b8f_2870x1478.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe84c871c-a687-4bd6-a328-bfcb708b1b8f_2870x1478.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe84c871c-a687-4bd6-a328-bfcb708b1b8f_2870x1478.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a></figure></div><p>To compound matters, the EU measures and publishes the Total Number of Allowances in Circulation (TNAIC) and it uses this measure to further <em><strong>reduce</strong></em> the number of new allowances made available for auction in the upcoming period. Here&#8217;s a quote from a European Commission press release on the matter which was <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/clima/news-your-voice/news/ets-market-stability-reserve-reduce-auction-volume-over-378-million-allowances-between-september-2021-05-12_en">published</a> in May of last year:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>The European Commission published today the total number of allowances in circulation on the European carbon market. It amounts to 1,578,772,426 allowances. At the same time last year the amount was 1,385,496,166 allowances.</em></p><p><em>The total number of allowances in circulation plays an important role for the operation of the Market Stability Reserve (MSR), which began operating in January 2019. This indicator shows the amount of allowances in circulation in a transparent and predictable manner.</em></p><p><em><strong>As long as the indicator exceeds the threshold set in the legislation of 833 million allowances, a certain share of the total number of allowances in circulation is placed in the MSR each year</strong>. For the years 2019 to 2023, this share is set at 24% of the total number of allowances in circulation. <strong>Allowances are placed in the MSR by decreasing the amount of allowances that Member States auction</strong>.</em></p><p><em>Based on the indicator published today and on the provisions of the legislation (Decision 2015/1814, the MSR Decision), <strong>auction volumes from September 2021 to August 2022 will be reduced by 378,905,382 allowances, which will be placed in the MSR</strong>.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>This is, in effect, a HODL Mechanism&#8482;. &nbsp;While the EU ETS reduces its newly issued allowances, their scheme simultaneously encourages outside speculators to buy and hold existing allowances, soaking up supply knowing full well there is a forced buyer on the other side of the trade. As the opening quote of this piece by Lawson accurately summarizes, absent a political intervention it is difficult to see a scenario where a VW-type short squeeze can be avoided. Of course, such intervention can happen at any moment, and Lawson and Dark spend a fair amount of time debating at what price a political relief valve must be opened. Since they are both bullish on the trade, it is natural that they agree that price is much higher, and we find it tough to argue with their informed opinions.</p><p>Europe has been doing its level best to hammer its domestic power producers and erode its industrial base for years. What stops foreign adversaries from helping them along by bidding up the price of these carbon credits to create economic advantage for themselves? How much money would it really take to double or triple the price of carbon in the EU from here? Whatever happens, this is one of the most fascinating stories we&#8217;ve come across in quite some time.</p><p>We should close with an important disclaimer. We do not give investment advice at <em>Doomberg</em>, nobody on our team has any investments related to these carbon credits schemes, and we will not open any positions for at least 72 hours after this piece publishes, if at all.

&#8211; Charles Eames</p><p>Charles and Ray Eames are legends of industrial design. The married couple collaborated for decades in the famous Eames Office at 901 W. Washington Boulevard in Venice, California. They focused much of their efforts on designing gorgeous but functional furniture that could be mass-produced. They were pioneers in the use of molded plywood and fiberglass, incorporating these innovative materials into their designs through direct experimentation at <em>901</em>. This excerpt from a wonderful <a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20171218-charles-and-ray-eames-the-couple-who-shaped-the-way-we-live">profile</a> on the <em>BBC&#8217;</em>s<em> </em>website captures the essence of their legacy (emphasis added throughout this piece):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>After the war, a new generation of suburbanites wanted a new kind of d&#233;cor, and Charles and Ray provided it. Their mission statement was bold and simple: <strong>&#8216;We want to make the best for the most for the least.&#8217;</strong> Charles likened a good designer to a good host, anticipating the needs of his guests. The furniture they made was stylish and, above all, fit for purpose. No wonder it became the house style of America&#8217;s new moneyed middle class.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82d6d04c-076e-4a60-84ec-4b9650659d09_1600x900.jpeg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82d6d04c-076e-4a60-84ec-4b9650659d09_1600x900.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82d6d04c-076e-4a60-84ec-4b9650659d09_1600x900.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82d6d04c-076e-4a60-84ec-4b9650659d09_1600x900.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82d6d04c-076e-4a60-84ec-4b9650659d09_1600x900.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82d6d04c-076e-4a60-84ec-4b9650659d09_1600x900.jpeg" width="1100" height="619" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/82d6d04c-076e-4a60-84ec-4b9650659d09_1600x900.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:619,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:329876,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82d6d04c-076e-4a60-84ec-4b9650659d09_1600x900.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82d6d04c-076e-4a60-84ec-4b9650659d09_1600x900.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82d6d04c-076e-4a60-84ec-4b9650659d09_1600x900.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82d6d04c-076e-4a60-84ec-4b9650659d09_1600x900.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Charles and Ray Eames | photo credit Eames Office LLC</figcaption></figure></div><p>In addition to being excellent designers, the Eameses were also successful architects and filmmakers. At their core, the Eameses were <em><strong>content creators</strong></em> that were well ahead of their time, which is why we are featuring them in this month&#8217;s edition of <em>The Work of My Life</em>. While we are huge fans of their work, what interests us most about the Eameses was their knack for a critical skill that many content creators overlook. The Eameses were <em><strong>outstanding marketers</strong></em>, and for proof we point to a product that seems to run counter to their mission as stated in the quote above &#8211; the Eames Lounge Chair.</p><p>As anyone who has ever sat in one can attest, the Eames Lounge Chair induces a strong <em><strong>gut feeling</strong></em> that it is the perfect piece of furniture. But don&#8217;t just take our word for it. This is from a November 2021 review by Elise Portale <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/eames-lounge-chair-review">published</a> by <em>Architectural Digest</em>:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>I have a confession to make: I wanted this chair to be bad. The iconic Eames design is so beloved, so coveted, a part of me really hoped it wouldn&#8217;t live up to all the hype. It has a great look, sure, but was it really so much better than any other chair? Cynicism be damned, that lounge sure is comfortable. In terms of ergonomics, the seat is permanently tilted back in a way that is almost distressingly low to the ground, <strong>but when I threw my legs up on that ottoman and let myself actually sink in, I felt as if I had never properly enjoyed a chair before in my life</strong>. Everything has been considered&#8212;sit up and enjoy a morning latte, sink down and rest your head on the rounded plush headrest, stretch out, curl in, sit sideways, swivel, rock back and forth. The Eameses built the impossible: A chair that&#8217;s comfortable no matter how you want to sit in it. I used to just flop on the sofa to chill and watch TikTok during my spare time. But since my new 65-year-old roommate moved in, I find myself with a new hobby: <strong>Sitting just to sit in it. It&#8217;s remarkable.</strong></em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Felt. Enjoyed. Remarkable. These are gut feelings, and as we explained in <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/the-riches-are-in-the-niches">last month&#8217;s</a> <em>Work of My Life</em>, this is the literal definition of a brand. Portale is channeling the <em><strong>Eames brand</strong></em> in her review of that chair, but what makes the product seem counter to the Eames&#8217; mission is its price. In the US, the Eames Lounge Chair and Ottoman has been produced exclusively by Herman Miller since 1956 and procuring a new set today will cost you nearly eight thousand dollars, making it virtually inaccessible to their core mass-market customers.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9ce2fd7-456a-45f2-b837-a63c0c645d7e_912x1234.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9ce2fd7-456a-45f2-b837-a63c0c645d7e_912x1234.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9ce2fd7-456a-45f2-b837-a63c0c645d7e_912x1234.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9ce2fd7-456a-45f2-b837-a63c0c645d7e_912x1234.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9ce2fd7-456a-45f2-b837-a63c0c645d7e_912x1234.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9ce2fd7-456a-45f2-b837-a63c0c645d7e_912x1234.png" width="658" height="890.3201754385965" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c9ce2fd7-456a-45f2-b837-a63c0c645d7e_912x1234.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1234,&quot;width&quot;:912,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:658,&quot;bytes&quot;:1855615,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9ce2fd7-456a-45f2-b837-a63c0c645d7e_912x1234.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9ce2fd7-456a-45f2-b837-a63c0c645d7e_912x1234.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9ce2fd7-456a-45f2-b837-a63c0c645d7e_912x1234.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9ce2fd7-456a-45f2-b837-a63c0c645d7e_912x1234.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Eames lounge chair and ottoman | photo via dwr.com</figcaption></figure></div><p>The product is a quintessential example of flagship marketing &#8211; the exception that proves the rule. If the people who work in <em>901</em> can design the best chair of all time, surely the furniture they design that <em><strong>I can</strong></em> afford must be an amazing value! By curating the legend of the Eames Lounge Chair and maintaining strict adherence to its quality and price over the decades, the Eameses executed a marketing coup. The message could not be more clear: <em>901</em> is filled with design geniuses, and <em><strong>you will be rewarded for many years to come by buying from them!</strong></em></p><p>Many people conflate marketing with market research and advertising, but we have a different definition of the word. <em><strong>Marketing is the consistent articulation of your brand ambition at every interface with your target customers.</strong></em> For final proof of the Eameses marketing chops, consider the feeling we induced in you each time we referred to the Eames Office by its nickname &#8211; <em>901</em>. That building is not simply an office and prototype shop. It is <em>901</em>. It has a mystique. It is iconic. It is a coveted place for aspiring designers to work. And, it is no accident that this nickname is in the design world&#8217;s lexicon &#8211; the Eameses made sure of it. The mere reference to their place of business became an expression of their brand ambition, something their target customers felt in their gut when they heard <em>901</em>. Genius, indeed.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa349206f-1267-4769-8c39-cead338352ce_1263x1000.jpeg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa349206f-1267-4769-8c39-cead338352ce_1263x1000.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa349206f-1267-4769-8c39-cead338352ce_1263x1000.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa349206f-1267-4769-8c39-cead338352ce_1263x1000.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa349206f-1267-4769-8c39-cead338352ce_1263x1000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa349206f-1267-4769-8c39-cead338352ce_1263x1000.jpeg" width="1100" height="871" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a349206f-1267-4769-8c39-cead338352ce_1263x1000.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:871,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:384669,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa349206f-1267-4769-8c39-cead338352ce_1263x1000.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa349206f-1267-4769-8c39-cead338352ce_1263x1000.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa349206f-1267-4769-8c39-cead338352ce_1263x1000.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa349206f-1267-4769-8c39-cead338352ce_1263x1000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></a><figcaption class="image-caption">901 | photo credit Eames Office LLC</figcaption></figure></div><p>We don&#8217;t write about the Eameses to compare ourselves to them, but rather to learn from them.
