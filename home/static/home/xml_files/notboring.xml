Third time&#8217;s a charm.&nbsp;</p><p>When <a href="https://ramp.com/">Ramp</a> CEO Eric Glyman called a couple months ago to let me know they were raising a round and ask if I&#8217;d want to write about it, my initial reaction was &#8220;Let me think about it.&#8221; I&#8217;d never written about a company other than Ramp twice, let alone three times.&nbsp;</p><p>But then Eric and I got to talking about updates and growth and the new things they were working on and how the round came together and all of the little details that go into making the Ramp story so compelling. Less than a year after writing about Ramp the last time, there&#8217;s a much bigger story to tell. </p><p>By the numbers, when I wrote about Ramp in December 2020, the company had just passed $100 million in transaction volume &#8211; money spent on its cards; today, it&#8217;s sharing that it already crossed a <strong>$100 million revenue run rate</strong>.&nbsp;It was worth ~$250-300 million then; it&#8217;s worth $8.1 billion now.</p><p>Plus, there&#8217;s something fascinating about following one company through its journey from the early days into an <strong>octocorn </strong>(I&#8217;m sorry) that&#8217;s set to become one of those all-time special ones. And it wouldn&#8217;t be a Ramp story without insiders doubling and tripling down whenever they get the chance.</p><p>Ramp is a portfolio company, but this is <strong>not </strong>a sponsored deep dive. It&#8217;s just a snapshot in time of one of the companies I appreciate the most, and a look ahead at what it might do in the future.</p><p>Let&#8217;s get to it.</p><div><hr></div><h1><a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/ramping-up">Ramping Up</a></h1><p>(Click &#128070; to read online)</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc56e0c62-1193-426e-97d5-8ebda2554f13_1200x600.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc56e0c62-1193-426e-97d5-8ebda2554f13_1200x600.png" width="1200" height="600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c56e0c62-1193-426e-97d5-8ebda2554f13_1200x600.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:600,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:190575,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc56e0c62-1193-426e-97d5-8ebda2554f13_1200x600.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc56e0c62-1193-426e-97d5-8ebda2554f13_1200x600.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc56e0c62-1193-426e-97d5-8ebda2554f13_1200x600.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc56e0c62-1193-426e-97d5-8ebda2554f13_1200x600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded Google in 1998.

The best analogy that I can come up with is that it&#8217;s like the <strong>transition from GUI to APIs, but for business spending</strong>. Like an automatic Coupa or Ariba for the long-tail of transactions. There are a lot of processes that were once manual &#8211; that humans did one at a time with pen and paper or through a computer interface &#8211; that computers now sort out with each other, via APIs. The same thing will inevitably happen to purchasing. It just takes the ability to get into the transaction (card or invoice) and the right software products.</p><p>From there, the possibilities are endless. A lot of this spend presents an interchange opportunity, an affiliate opportunity, and even a financing opportunity, all aligned with the customer.&nbsp;</p><p>But before we get to that future, Ramp&#8217;s doing pretty well today.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, it&#8217;s <strong>announcing a $750 million round</strong> &#8211; $200 million in equity and $550 million in debt &#8211; that values the company at <strong>$8.1 billion</strong>, led by Founders Fund. All existing major investors are participating, along with new investors. I&#8217;m ecstatic that Not Boring Capital gets to double down.&nbsp;</p><p>Ramp raised the round on world-class growth and a steep trajectory. <strong>The company is worth roughly 25x </strong>what it was when then-Mainstreeter <a href="https://twitter.com/nickabouzeid">Nick Abouzeid</a><strong> </strong>introduced me to Ramp co-founder and CEO Eric Glyman in September 2020,<strong> </strong>18 months ago.

Since launching in February 2020, it&#8217;s <strong>saved customers $135 million and 3.5 million hours of labor</strong> (roughly 5.2 human lifetimes&#8217; worth of just doing expenses). It&#8217;s done all of that despite only increasing headcount from 60 to 275 between September 2020 and today.</p><p>So in the first part of the essay, we&#8217;ll go behind-the-scenes on Ramp&#8217;s recent round and we&#8217;ll put Ramp&#8217;s exceptional growth, mainly driven by the corporate card, in context.&nbsp;</p><p>But Ramp&#8217;s real magic is its <strong>product velocity</strong>, or how fast it ships software. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to take it from &#8220;fastest-growing corporate card company&#8221; to &#8220;<strong>software-powered transaction-layer orchestrator.&#8221;</strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/rabois">Keith Rabois</a></strong>, the Founders Fund partner who&#8217;s led or invested in every Ramp round over the past three years, told me, &#8220;<strong>Ramp&#8217;s product velocity is absolutely unprecedented in my 21 years working with technology businesses.&#8221;</strong></p><p>To build great software fast, Ramp has created one of the <strong>densest talent vortexes in tech. </strong>It ships big new products every month. Its team is, frankly, overqualified to run a corporate card company. That&#8217;s because it wasn&#8217;t built to run a corporate card company.</p><p>In the second half of the essay, we&#8217;ll dig into Ramp&#8217;s<strong> second act</strong>, the shift from corporate card and spend management software to comprehensive <strong>financial orchestration platform</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>By starting with the corporate card, Ramp has been able to build an incredibly fast-growing business, raise over $1 billion in financing in three years, and <strong>most importantly</strong>, <strong>wedge its way into the CFO suite</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>From inside the CFO Suite, it&#8217;s been able to launch products to compete with entire multi-billion dollar incumbents like Bill.com, Expensify, and Concur and <strong>give them away for free</strong>. It&#8217;s done so with <strong>teams of only 3-5 engineers on each product while maintaining NPS scores as high as or higher than Apple</strong>. That&#8217;s just the beginning.</p><p>Ramp is shipping new products monthly and stitching them together in clever ways. It&#8217;s combining the product velocity of a SaaS company with the transaction visibility of a fintech. That&#8217;s a sneakily powerful combination. </p><p>The thing I love about Ramp is that each time I revisit the company, I discover an entirely new, enormous opportunity in front of it. This time, the new thing that&#8217;s emerged is that by building <strong>the best technology company with a corporate card</strong>, Ramp might be able to own the business transaction layer and use the <strong>transactions themselves as mini-apps</strong>.</p><p>The other thing I love is that Eric and Karim are always willing to share the how &#8211; How have they grown this fast? How did they design the team? How will they keep the growth up? &#8211; so we&#8217;ll cover all of that, too.

There&#8217;s a clear path to a $100 billion valuation for itself, but more importantly, Ramp&#8217;s in an incredibly high-leverage spot: as it helps companies save time and money, they can reinvest in product and growth. The companies that take us to space, deliver personalized healthcare, fix the climate, and more will be made stronger by working with Ramp.&nbsp;</p><p>That&#8217;s high praise, even for me.

Ramp&#8217;s Law? &#8211; <strong>Ramp&#8217;s valuation roughly doubles roughly every six months</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the notable things about Ramp&#8217;s fundraising has been how consistently rounds have been <strong>preempted by insiders</strong>. To this day, Ramp still hasn&#8217;t made a single fundraising deck. Instead, based on board decks or investor update emails, an existing investor typically offers Ramp a term sheet at roughly double the previous valuation. Because Ramp hasn&#8217;t burned a lot of money, it never <em>needs</em> to raise, so it seemingly only does so when both sides agree that it&#8217;s worth about double what it was in the last round.</p><p>So how&#8217;d Keith square a double with the worsening market conditions?&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;It was the <strong>easiest decision ever</strong>. The traditional Founders Fund strategy is to double, triple, and quadruple down into our best companies,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Ramp is the quintessential example of the kind of company we want to quadruple down in.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Plus, he told me, venture capital thinks on <strong>longer time horizons</strong> &#8211; 8-12 years for a venture fund, 3-5 years for a growth fund &#8211; and he views Ramp as a great opportunity to invest over the long term. On that time horizon, what matters most are <strong>velocity</strong> and <strong>trajectory</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Ramp&#8217;s <strong>product velocity</strong>, which was &#8220;absolutely unprecedented&#8221; in his 21 years. We&#8217;ll come back to this.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Ramp&#8217;s <strong>unprecedented growth trajectory.&nbsp;</strong></p></li></ul><p>Paying 80-100x revenues in this market after calling the top seems crazy. And <em><strong>ceteris paribus</strong></em> it would be. But companies aren&#8217;t snapshots in time; they have motion. <a href="https://twitter.com/loganbartlett">Logan Bartlett</a>, who&#8217;s invested in each of the past three rounds at Redpoint, explained:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>If you pick any trailing point in time, paying high multiples looks stupid. But companies are theoretically worth the discounted sum of <strong>future</strong> cashflows. The disconnect is that <strong>future growth is always hard to grok</strong>.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>Let&#8217;s grok it.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Ramp&#8217;s Unprecedented Growth and How to Value It</strong></h3><p>In the last Ramp piece I wrote, I included a section titled &#8220;<strong>Has Venture Capital Lost Its Mind?</strong>&#8221;&nbsp; The pace of funding was so fast, the numbers were so high, and the double-rounds were so uncommon that it was worth asking.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, I didn&#8217;t believe that Ramp&#8217;s rounds were a sign of VC madness. Something else was at play: <strong>growth</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>For many reasons&nbsp; &#8211; better primitives, examples, funding, talent &#8211; companies are growing faster now than they were a decade ago. At the time, Logan guessed that just a decade ago, <strong>it would have taken seven or eight years for even a great company to build what Ramp did in two. </strong>That has implications on valuation.&nbsp;</p><p>To highlight how important growth is, I made up an example involving two companies &#8211; Company A and Company B &#8211; which each start with $10 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) after a year and grow to $100 million in ARR. Company A takes four years to get there and Company B takes three years. That seems like a minor difference &#8211; they both got to $100 million in ARR so fast! &#8211; but it&#8217;s actually huge. Company A is growing at an impressive 115% per year. <strong>Company B is growing at 216%!</strong> As time goes on, the difference gets dramatic: by each company&#8217;s fifth year, Company A is doing $215 million in revenue; <strong>Company B is doing $1 billion!</strong></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F396e6cbf-ad17-4d2a-8cdc-cdc1d3f6571c_1299x365.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F396e6cbf-ad17-4d2a-8cdc-cdc1d3f6571c_1299x365.png" width="1299" height="365" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/396e6cbf-ad17-4d2a-8cdc-cdc1d3f6571c_1299x365.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:365,&quot;width&quot;:1299,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F396e6cbf-ad17-4d2a-8cdc-cdc1d3f6571c_1299x365.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F396e6cbf-ad17-4d2a-8cdc-cdc1d3f6571c_1299x365.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F396e6cbf-ad17-4d2a-8cdc-cdc1d3f6571c_1299x365.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F396e6cbf-ad17-4d2a-8cdc-cdc1d3f6571c_1299x365.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>I thought that was pretty stark.

Most categories aren&#8217;t big enough to support a player of that size. But business spending can.

Of the current crop of scale ups, Ramp anecdotally seems to have done the best job of this.</a><a href="https://twitter.com/aashaysanghvi_/status/1496300680793010180" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-footer"><p class="tweet-date">February 23rd 2022</p><span class="retweets"><span class="rt-count">30</span> Retweets</span><span class="likes"><span class="like-count">450</span> Likes</span></div></a></div><p>All of that talent and raw energy would be wasted on a corporate card company, though, particularly one that used its financial responsibilities as an excuse to move slowly. But of course, as a company responsible for companies&#8217; money, Ramp can&#8217;t entirely move fast and break things.&nbsp;</p><p>Which brings us to the second part of the secret sauce: <strong>structure</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>When I asked Keith, who was an executive at PayPal and COO at Square, for a non-intuitive insight about what makes Ramp so special, he doubled down on product velocity:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>Their execution is unprecedented. Their ability to take a <strong>long-term vision</strong>, distill it into a <strong>short-term roadmap</strong>, and <strong>execute in parallel across a variety of products</strong> is unique, especially in a <strong>zero-defects industry</strong> like financial services.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>Karim built the product and engineering team to do specifically that &#8211; to move fast without breaking things that shouldn&#8217;t break. Early on, he realized that Ramp was attracting two types of people:</p><ul><li><p>People who love to <strong>move fast and build new things</strong> and stay up all night fixing what they break.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>People who are <strong>deliberate and like to write perfect code the first time</strong>.</p></li></ul><p>A fast-moving financial software company, he realized, would need both types, for different things, so he made a big decision early: <strong>split product, design and engineering into two team archetypes</strong>.</p><p>One team, full of the <strong>deliberate code craftspeople</strong>, would handle all of the things that can&#8217;t afford to have mistakes, like underwriting and transaction processing, in addition to building strong infrastructure and integrations. This team does a lot of the hard work to build a single, unified backend so that companies can plug in whatever financial software they use and let Ramp&#8217;s software translate between it all. It&#8217;s all on Ramp &#8211; one database, one platform.&nbsp;</p><p>The other team, full of the <strong>fast-moving builders</strong>, have a long leash to create new products with very little organizational overhead. This team was clearly built in reaction to Eric and Karim&#8217;s experience at Capital One. This team splits into smaller teams of 3-5 world-class engineers paired with designers and PMs who attack new opportunities.</p><p>In addition to their raw talent, a big reason this team is able to build new products so quickly is that they&#8217;re <strong>building on top of the high-quality data and tech infrastructure developed by the other team.</strong></p><p>The reason they&#8217;re able to build the <em><strong>right</strong></em> things quickly is the third leg: Ramp&#8217;s <strong>mission</strong>.</p><p>Ramp&#8217;s mission from the beginning &#8211; and even from the Paribus days &#8211; has been to <strong>save people time and money</strong>. Anything that its product and eng SWAT team spins up needs to drive towards that mission.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>More than a Card</strong></h3><p>One of the things that&#8217;s fascinated me most about Ramp since the beginning is how it <strong>uses interchange revenue to build new software products</strong>, deepening its moat.&nbsp;</p><p>Ramp earns <strong>interchange</strong> &#8211; 1.5-2.5%, paid by merchants and card networks &#8211; when customers spend using the card. Taking ~2% of the $1.5 trillion (and growing) companies spend on cards every year is a $30 billion (and growing) annual opportunity. Plus, it&#8217;s essentially <strong>inflation-proof</strong> since it&#8217;s indexed to total spend &#8211; as businesses spend more, Ramp makes proportionally more. That might be one of the reasons AmEx has done well while growth companies have tanked.</p><p>But the plan was never to build a corporate card company. From the beginning, it&#8217;s been about <strong>saving companies time and money</strong>. To date, it&#8217;s <strong>saved customers 3.5 million hours of labor </strong>and<strong> $135 million.</strong></p><p>Helping companies spend less seems like a counterintuitive bet in an industry in which revenue is directly tied to spend. Most credit card companies use the money they make on interchange to reward users with points in order to get them to spend more so that they can make more on interchange. <strong>Ramp plows its interchange revenue back into better financial software.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The plan all along was to start with a card and build out a full suite of financial software aimed at helping companies build better businesses, and I have the &#8230; receipts &#8230; to prove it.&nbsp; Way back in December 2020, I <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/ramp-the-card-sized-finance-team?s=w">wrote</a>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>If you want to build software that helps companies save money, <strong>the corporate card is a smart place to start</strong>.

I learned that lesson the hard way. It has incredibly strong distribution and network effects &#8211; as evidenced by the fact that I still use it because the companies who pay me use it &#8211; and Ramp&#8217;s product isn&#8217;t fully developed yet. For example, it handles the Accounts Payable side but not the Accounts Receivable side, which means I could use it to pay bills but not to send invoices.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, I&#8217;ve used the product and it&#8217;s <strong>so much better and faster than Bill</strong>. It reads and itemizes invoices with 99.9% accuracy. And it&#8217;s growing. Without marketing the product beyond current customers, it&#8217;s <strong>grown 70% MoM since launching publicly</strong>, and it&#8217;s already starting to show synergistic effects with the card. Card customers are much less likely to churn, for example, if they&#8217;re using <a href="https://billpay.com/">Bill Pay</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>And as Ramp&#8217;s first major non-card product, Bill Pay has the potential to build the next S-Curve for the business. A typical S-Curve describes the idea that a product&#8217;s growth normally starts slow, accelerates for a period of time, and inevitably slows down at maturity once it&#8217;s saturated the market.

As Ramp handles more transactions for business automatically, the new framing makes a lot more sense.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda54e273-59ec-4994-9414-a59997ff22da_1600x851.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda54e273-59ec-4994-9414-a59997ff22da_1600x851.png" width="1456" height="774" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/da54e273-59ec-4994-9414-a59997ff22da_1600x851.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:774,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda54e273-59ec-4994-9414-a59997ff22da_1600x851.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda54e273-59ec-4994-9414-a59997ff22da_1600x851.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda54e273-59ec-4994-9414-a59997ff22da_1600x851.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda54e273-59ec-4994-9414-a59997ff22da_1600x851.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>New Ramp Website, Arrows Mine</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>From the beginning, Ramp has been all about saving time and money, because that time and money can be reinvested into helping businesses grow.

You couldn&#8217;t build this product without it. Because Ramp can see and understand every transaction employees make, it can organize every trip-related expense whether an employee books on Travelocity, Expedia, Airbnb, directly with the airline, at a local restaurant, or anywhere else. Employees don&#8217;t need to book through specific travel sites because the card is smart enough to figure out what employees are doing.</p><p>But a corporate card isn&#8217;t enough. <strong>This product needs good software to work</strong> &#8211; including some software that Ramp&#8217;s built already. For example, last summer, Ramp rolled out controls that let employers <a href="https://ramp.com/blog/announcing-merchant-restrictions">set limits on spend at the merchant level</a>. Ramp has let employers set limits per card for a long time. And Ramp easily integrates into companies&#8217; HRIS systems, so they know what level each employee is.&nbsp;</p><p>So now, companies can set custom travel policies &#8211; by trip length, seniority level, or even individual &#8211; that are <strong>enforced at the card level</strong>.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4e767b0-7f45-4b82-b5ac-f38e9753e310_1200x630.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4e767b0-7f45-4b82-b5ac-f38e9753e310_1200x630.png" width="1200" height="630" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d4e767b0-7f45-4b82-b5ac-f38e9753e310_1200x630.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:630,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4e767b0-7f45-4b82-b5ac-f38e9753e310_1200x630.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4e767b0-7f45-4b82-b5ac-f38e9753e310_1200x630.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4e767b0-7f45-4b82-b5ac-f38e9753e310_1200x630.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4e767b0-7f45-4b82-b5ac-f38e9753e310_1200x630.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Ramp for Travel</em>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure></div><p>If I try to book a $1k per night Airbnb but the company&#8217;s nightly room max is $250, the transaction is flagged and my manager can ask me to <strong>one-click reimburse</strong> the company for the balance in a click.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It&#8217;s a subtly massive shift in the way financial software can work.

What did he mean? <em>Is</em> Ramp the perfect B2B business?&nbsp;</p><p>Today, it certainly looks like an excellent, top 1% kind of business:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>It&#8217;s the <strong>fastest SaaS business to reach a $100 million revenue run rate</strong> in history.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>It <strong>makes money when customers</strong> <strong>spend money on their card</strong>, which they already do.</p></li><li><p>It <strong>grows when its customers grow</strong>.</p></li><li><p>It&#8217;s taken a big, old, fragmented industry and <strong>modernized it with software</strong>.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>It <strong>checks, and exceeds, all of the metrics boxes</strong>.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>It&#8217;s even <strong>inflation hedged</strong>, if prices go up, it makes more revenue, automatically.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>I&#8217;d invest in a business like that any day, but those points alone don&#8217;t make it <em>perfect</em>.</p><p>What makes Ramp so special &#8211; and why I think it&#8217;s a <strong>generational business</strong> &#8211; is that while it&#8217;s been growing the original corporate card business so quickly, it&#8217;s simultaneously been laying the groundwork for the really big, Google-sized opportunity.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of giving customers more rewards points, Ramp has been <strong>plowing interchange back into software</strong>. Great software creates moats; points don&#8217;t.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, <strong>saving companies time and money </strong>isn&#8217;t just good marketing and counter-positioning. It lays the groundwork for Ramp&#8217;s really big ambitions. Customers are more likely to <strong>trust the company that&#8217;s been saving them time and money to automate their finances</strong> than they are to trust the card companies that have been trying to get them to spend more.</p><p>The fruits of its world-class product velocity are just starting to become clear &#8211; Bill Pay, Travel, Negotiation, Receipt Integrations, and a new Chrome Extension have all shipped in just the past few months. Ramp is <strong>giving them all away for free</strong>. It might be able to monetize them, directly or indirectly, or use them to continue to make the decision to go with Ramp a no-brainer.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether it monetizes today or not, each of these products does <strong>double-duty</strong>: they save customers time and money today, and they&#8217;re all <strong>infrastructure or mini-apps</strong> for Ramp&#8217;s transaction orchestration future.</p><p>The biggest reason that Ramp is going to be generational is that it&#8217;s the first company to <strong>recognize the potential of business transactions as mini-apps</strong> and to design a company to build accordingly.&nbsp;</p><p>Ramp&#8217;s famous <strong>product velocity</strong>, for example, is made all the more valuable by the fact that its team will have the evergreen opportunity to build new mini-apps based on what it&#8217;s seeing in the transactions. Being able to swarm those opportunities quickly with 3-5 person teams is a superpower.</p><p>Ramp&#8217;s corporate card wasn&#8217;t just a Trojan Horse into the CFO Suite; it was a Trojan Horse into all business transactions, and Ramp loaded the horse with engineers able to respond to whatever they face inside the walls.&nbsp;</p><p>And as it adds new payment products, like Bill Pay, it will get even <strong>more data</strong> that it can use to help companies save time and money, and <strong>more transactions from which to launch mini-apps</strong>. The more mini-apps it launches, the more of companies&#8217; spend it can orchestrate.&nbsp;</p><p>Ramp&#8217;s gotten to $100 million in revenue on one revenue stream and less than $5 billion in transactions. In a <strong>$100 trillion+ global business spend market</strong>, the opportunities are endless. In just <strong>Travel</strong> and <strong>Procurement</strong>, it could flip a switch and start monetizing tomorrow. <strong>Bill Pay</strong> offers endless opportunities for monetization, from SaaS fees (unlikely) to financing. With $550 million in fresh debt at its disposal, that seems like a reasonable possibility.&nbsp;</p><p>For now, though, monetization is secondary. It happens naturally, every time companies spend on the card, and Ramp has plenty of cash to keep going for a long time. For now, <strong>growth is king</strong>. More is more:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>The <strong>more customers</strong> Ramp gets, the <strong>more spend</strong> it can help orchestrate.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The <strong>more spend it orchestrates</strong>, the <strong>more data</strong> it gets and the <strong>more buying leverage</strong> it has on its customers&#8217; behalf.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>more Ramp products</strong> each customer uses, the <strong>better product experiences</strong> it can design and the <strong>stickier</strong> each customer becomes.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The <strong>more products with network effects</strong>, like Bill Pay, get adopted, the <strong>faster Ramp spreads</strong>.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The <strong>more both parties in a transaction use Ramp</strong>, the <strong>smoother</strong> Ramp can make the experience.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>If Ramp just keeps growing its corporate card business at even half the rate it&#8217;s growing today, this becomes a $50 billion company in the next few years.&nbsp;</p><p>But if Ramp is able to keep growing and keep shipping simultaneously, and if it can fold all of its products into a clean, comprehensive offering that saves time and money for customers <em>automatically</em>, it has the chance to own and finally bring intelligence to the most valuable real estate on the internet: the <strong>transaction</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>That&#8217;s more valuable than search. That&#8217;s a trillion dollar opportunity.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Ramp Fireside with Eric and Karim</strong></p><p><em>The written story is one thing, hearing from Eric and Karim directly is another.

At its core is a <strong>personalized, self-serve debt repayment experience</strong> that uses machine learning to reach consumers at the right time via the right channels. Instead of constant cold-calling, TrueAccord might text or email at times its found are most successful. Because the company has always had ambitions to build a full suite of financial services for its target audience, it&#8217;s taken a much friendlier approach to collections, one meant to <strong>retain instead of repel</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Consumers can and do work with TrueAccord directly to get control of their debt, but the secret sauce in TrueAccord&#8217;s approach to date has been <strong><a href="https://www.trueaccord.com/product/recover/#">Recover</a></strong>: a late-stage recovery (read: debt collection) product through which <strong>companies pay TrueAccord</strong> to collect debt from their customers.&nbsp;</p><p>BNPL giants <strong>Klarna</strong> and <strong>Affirm</strong>, for example, outsource collections to TrueAccord and pay TrueAccord a portion of what it collects. More importantly, when considering the vision to provide more financial services to the target market, when companies buy Recover, <strong>TrueAccord gets paid to acquire customers</strong>. That means it has a <strong>negative CAC on consumers</strong>.</p><p>It seems to be working. Each month, creditors send TrueAccord <strong>500k - 1 million</strong> potential customers, for free, and then pay them a commission on repaid debt!&nbsp;</p><p>The promise and success of Recover has attracted some of the world&#8217;s top investors including Khosla Ventures, Homebrew, Felicis, Arbor Ventures, and PayPal/Affirm founder Max Levchin. We backed the company last year, before there was Not Boring Capital, via the Not Boring Syndicate.&nbsp;</p><p>When we invested in TrueAccord March of last year, I wrote up a short memo on what excited me about the opportunity. I&#8217;m going to include three sections exactly as-is from that memo:</p><ul><li><p><strong>TrueAccord: The Nice Guy in the Massive Debt Collection Market</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Consumer Debt Repayment as a Wedge</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Unsexiness-as-a-Moat&nbsp;</strong></p></li></ul><p>But then I&#8217;m going to show you what I missed, too. I didn&#8217;t think big enough. It&#8217;s a good reminder &#8211; particularly in a period when everyone seems to have turned impossibly bearish &#8211; that markets change and evolve in unpredictable ways, and that building blocks can snap together in ways that create bigger-than-anticipated opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>In TrueAccord&#8217;s case, I didn&#8217;t predict <strong>how central lending and consumer debt would become to fintech</strong> &#8211; fueled by the dramatic ascent of Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL), consumer fintech, and embedded finance. Some of the most successful tech companies have become, wittingly or unwittingly, creditors.&nbsp;The debt market actually shrank last year thanks to stimulus checks, and as it comes back, the lender composition will lean more tech-forward than it was before. </p><p>In response, last September, <strong>TrueAccord launched its second product, <a href="https://blog.trueaccord.com/2021/09/trueaccord-launches-retain-a-digital-first-solution-for-early-stage-collections/#:~:text=16%2C%202021%20%E2%80%93%20TrueAccord%20Corporation%2C,with%20past%2Ddue%20delinquent%20accounts.">Retain</a>,</strong> a white-label SaaS product that fintechs can use to collect <strong>early-stage delinquencies</strong> before consumers default, when they&#8217;re much more likely to pay.&nbsp;</p><p>Like <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/lithics-new-customer">Lithic</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lcoNXAEKorpT9CZXoG3FN?si=f7ef1bcb12e9421b">Onbo</a>, and of course, AWS, TrueAccord turned many of the tools it built for its own first product, Recover, into infrastructure for other companies with Retain. Ohad calls it the &#8220;AWS of Consumer Debt and Delinquency.&#8221;</p><p>Retain uses data on the 16 million consumers it&#8217;s worked with directly and through Recover, plus TrueAccord&#8217;s HeartBeat machine learning platform, to identify delinquent customers and reach them through the best touchpoint at the best time. Unlike Recover, through which clients <em>outsource</em> collections to TrueAccord, clients <em>embed</em> Retain right in their stack.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of collecting post-default, Retain helps keep consumers from defaulting on loans in a much friendlier, more tech-forward, and effective way than any traditional delinquency or collections solution could. It&#8217;s growing like crazy &#8211; crossing the 1 million consumer mark in less than 6 months &#8211; and is used by fintech platforms like <a href="https://synapsefi.com/">SynapseFi</a> and <a href="https://silamoney.com/">Sila</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>I also missed just how important the <strong>incentive alignment </strong>narrative would become in 2021 and 2022. TrueAccord&#8217;s business model is aligned with both creditors and consumers: Recover, for example, only makes money when consumers get out of debt. As one sign of that alignment, TrueAccord successfully lobbied for the passage of the CFPB&#8217;s <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/final-rules/debt-collection-practices-regulation-f/">Regulation F</a>, which limits debt collectors&#8217; ability to hound people on the phone, among other things.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the past year&#8217;s biggest themes has been <strong>reinventing financial services</strong>. Fintech and web3 attracted as much attention and venture capital dollars as any category. The promise of many of these products is that they&#8217;ll be able to provide opportunities to people who are left behind by the traditional financial system.&nbsp;</p><p>No one is more focused on making sure that everyone has a fair financial chance than TrueAccord. They&#8217;ve been working on this for eight years, despite and even because of the fact that debt collection is an unsexy category.&nbsp;</p><p>So today, we&#8217;ll look back at last March&#8217;s memo before looking forward to what the world, and the financial system, look like when TrueAccord achieves its vision:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p><strong>The 2021 Memo</strong>: Nice Guy, Debt Collection-as-a-Wedge, Unsexiness as a Moat&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>What I Missed: </strong>Retain, Incentive Alignment, and a World Without Debt Traps</p></li></ol><h2><strong>The 2021 Memo</strong></h2><h3><strong>TrueAccord: The Nice Guy in the Massive Debt Collection Market</strong></h3><p>Depending on which source you use, <strong>50-80 million Americans spend a significant amount of their income on late charges and interest rates</strong>, get harassed on a daily basis by collectors, and are locked out of basic financial services. These people, by and large, are neither miscreants nor victims. They&#8217;re totally normal people who happen to be in debt, and want a way out that doesn&#8217;t involve a massive hit to their credit or a lifetime of ballooning interest payments.&nbsp;</p><p>I was one of them; when I dislocated my knee in college, the hospital sent the bill to the wrong place, we never paid, and I only found out when a collections agency started harassing me. I was happy to pay, but realized that even paying would represent a black mark on my credit score. It was a no-win situation, and I basically had to pay and then wait for years for it to roll off my score. Luckily, I was young and didn&#8217;t have a family, but similar situations mean that normal people can&#8217;t access the banking system, further exacerbating their financial situation.</p><p>TrueAccord helps consumers pull their credit reports, <a href="https://www.trueaccordengage.com">negotiate with creditors and collectors</a> in an informed way by using AI to show them what other people have successfully said and done, uses its heft to negotiate with collectors on consumers&#8217; behalf, offers non-predatory 0% APR loans, and when the consumer is ready to pay, they can do it right through TrueAccord.&nbsp;</p><p>TrueAccord is not like the collections agencies you&#8217;re probably thinking about: it has a 4.8 star rating on Google and an A+ from the Better Business Bureau.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff34eeb40-0b57-41ec-a5ea-53c2b63b8940_1448x384.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff34eeb40-0b57-41ec-a5ea-53c2b63b8940_1448x384.png" width="1448" height="384" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f34eeb40-0b57-41ec-a5ea-53c2b63b8940_1448x384.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:384,&quot;width&quot;:1448,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff34eeb40-0b57-41ec-a5ea-53c2b63b8940_1448x384.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff34eeb40-0b57-41ec-a5ea-53c2b63b8940_1448x384.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff34eeb40-0b57-41ec-a5ea-53c2b63b8940_1448x384.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff34eeb40-0b57-41ec-a5ea-53c2b63b8940_1448x384.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Consumers never* <em>love</em> a collections agency, but that A+ is a sign that they at least respect TrueAccord.

TrueAccord&#8217;s main customers are companies that need to collect debts from customers -- Yelp, Upwork, and LendUp are some of its clients -- and collectively, they <strong>send TrueAccord 500k - 1 million people per month</strong>. Yup, instead of paying to acquire customers, companies just send them to TrueAccord. Of those, 5-30% choose to work with TrueAccord (<strong>it&#8217;s opt-in</strong>), and that number is growing as TrueAccord&#8217;s positive reputation builds. People in debt are rational and want a way out, and TrueAccord is the friendliest, easiest way to do that. Plus, the companies that send TrueAccord customers pay it 15-20% of the money collected. So really, the consumer debt repayment product that TrueAccord offers right now is a <strong>fast-growing, high-margin,&nbsp; negative-CAC channel for its bigger ambitions.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Once TrueAccord owns the customer relationship and has helped those consumers out of debt, it can begin to layer on additional financial services: partnerships with neobanks, debit cards, banking services. These are excellent businesses once the customer is in the door, but many attempts die at the hands of high CACs. TrueAccord is playing the long game, and has been for the past seven years, because it knows it can do well by doing good.&nbsp;</p><p>Fewer consumers in debt, more consumers with access to financial services, more profits for TrueAccord.&nbsp;</p><p>It sounds like a perfect playbook. Why hasn&#8217;t anyone done it before?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Unsexiness-as-a-Moat</strong></h3><p>We can all agree that debt collection isn&#8217;t sexy. We all want to avoid it entirely, and those of us who&#8217;ve had to engage know that it&#8217;s a terrible and hopeless experience.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#8217;s equally difficult to build a business in the space: there are compliance issues, reputational issues, people treat their vendors like shit, it&#8217;s commoditized, and there&#8217;s fierce competition from boiler room call centers. It&#8217;s different than traditional SaaS: your clients don&#8217;t love you, there&#8217;s no customer obsession. <strong>The best you can do is make sure that a customer&#8217;s experience with you sucked less than the customer&#8217;s experience with another company.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>For most people, that&#8217;s a deterrent. For Ohad, that was an opportunity. He bet that people would be attracted to other, shinier opportunities in fintech and avoid getting their hands dirty in consumer debt collection. He was right, and that&#8217;s given him and the TrueAccord team a seven year head start.&nbsp;</p><p>That head start means it&#8217;s <strong>worked with more than 16 million consumers</strong>, built up a massive database on what works with which types of vendors, and built something counterintuitive: a <strong>respected brand in debt collection</strong>. After years, people are talking online about their relatively positive experiences with TrueAccord, and that helps convince others to work with them when their collections are handed over.&nbsp;</p><p>It also means that TrueAccord has been able to build a <strong>uniquely cohesive culture</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something bonding,&#8221; Ohad quipped, &#8220;about a vision so compelling that smart people are willing to tell their friends and families they work in debt collection.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>The culture that TrueAccord has built around that vision is one of the company&#8217;s strengths and something that keeps it on the right track. He said that if he tried to ask TrueAccord&#8217;s head designer to do something that started exploiting consumers now that they&#8217;re big enough to do so, &#8220;She would tell me to go to hell and then quit on the spot. As she should.&#8221; </p><p>The company culture he described is like an antibody to bad behavior. &#8220;We don&#8217;t need a &#8216;no assholes&#8217; rule here because an asshole would naturally feel so out of place.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>TrueAccord is mission-driven, operating in an unsexy space, and taking a longer view than anyone in the room. It would be nearly impossible for a well-funded startup to come in and compete with TrueAccord because of the moat it&#8217;s built, and no large player wants the reputational risk of working in debt collection. It may be one of the few fintech companies impervious to Stripe&#8217;s ever-expanding scope; can you imagine Stripe Collect?&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What I Missed</strong> &nbsp;</h2><p>In the past year, instead of turning its focus more directly on consumers, TrueAccord discovered an opportunity to reach even more customers by providing white-labeled early-stage collection services to fintech companies via <strong>Retain</strong>. The vision remains the same, but the sequencing is different. Retain offers the <strong>opportunity to help the most people avoid default today</strong>.</p><p>That said, the same strategies apply to Retain:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Debt Collection as a Wedge</strong>.

Like Lithic and <a href="https://www.onbo.com/">Onbo</a>, it took what it built on the consumer-facing side and applied it to building infrastructure. Unlike a normal debt collection company, which puts the vast majority of its employees on the phone calling debtors, more than half of TrueAccord&#8217;s team is tech, product, and data science.

Every time I talk to Ohad, he points out that people who are in delinquency or collections aren&#8217;t bad people, and rarely just don&#8217;t want to pay their debt. Sometimes, they just forget, something falls through the cracks. Others, they just get <strong>overextended </strong>and <em>can&#8217;t </em>pay it.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe they make some mistakes. Maybe they get hit with an unexpected medical bill and rack up medical debt. Maybe they took on loans for college and are still paying them back years later. Maybe they just have a low salary despite working really hard. They fall into <strong>debt traps</strong> and they can&#8217;t get out.&nbsp;</p><p>At that point, historically, their life becomes more of a nightmare. They get harassing phone calls. The system is oppressively complex and they don&#8217;t know where to turn. Ohad told me that there are debt collectors out there who sue people, and then throw away the papers they were supposed to serve them, <strong>mark them as served anyway</strong>, and then start garnishing their wages without warning. The system is all about lawsuits and putting people in bankruptcy, and then making it really really hard to recover from bankruptcy. Without good software, and with no desire to continue the relationship with the consumer, the easiest way to collect from someone is to get the court to intervene.&nbsp;</p><p>But just like I write about upside alignment incentive in web3, <strong>Ohad is using alignment incentive to reshape the system</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>When we spoke last week, I asked him what the end state for TrueAccord is, and after half a second, he replied that he wants TrueAccord to be <strong>&#8220;the one company that knows how to help these consumers while ethically monetizing their journey.&#8221;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>That&#8217;s possible because TrueAccord&#8217;s incentives are aligned with consumers.&nbsp;</p><p>On the <strong>Recover</strong> side, TrueAccord is incentivized to find customers, give them the best service, help them pay back debt, and help them build equity. TrueAccord&#8217;s job is to navigate what the consumer can really afford and what the company will accept in a way that works for both sides. Creditors pay TrueAccord <strong>~22% of the amount they collect</strong>, so it wants to make it possible for people to pay back as much as possible, <em>and</em> TrueAccord wants to build long-term financial relationships with the consumers from whom they collect. That creates a healthy tension &#8211; between collection and customer acquisition &#8211; all funded by a third-party.&nbsp;</p><p>On the <strong>Retain </strong>side, TrueAccord is incentivized to keep clients&#8217; customers from defaulting <em>and</em> to keep them coming back. Since most of its Retain customers are brand-forward fintech companies who&#8217;ve spent a <strong>ton</strong> on customer acquisition, <strong>retention is as important as collection</strong>. It&#8217;s another healthy tension &#8211; between collection and retention. In this case, if TrueAccord does a good job, fintech companies will continue to pay its SaaS fees.&nbsp;</p><p>The alignment incentive even extends to regulation. Since TrueAccord is by far the most technically sophisticated debt collections company &#8211; which isn&#8217;t saying much &#8211; they lobbied for <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/final-rules/debt-collection-practices-regulation-f/">Regulation F</a>, which &#8220;almost obliterated the ability for collectors to harass customers over the phone in order to collect a debt.&#8221; Consumers win &#8211; they get harassing phone calls less often; TrueAccord wins &#8211; the method they use least and their competitors use most is hampered; and sleazy debt collectors lose.&nbsp;</p><p>But while they&#8217;re willing to pull out the legal big guns when needed, Ohad&#8217;s response when I asked how he&#8217;ll measure TrueAccord&#8217;s impact was the opposite: &#8220;<strong>We see our impact when we work with someone who used to sue a lot of people, and we track how much less they sue.</strong>&#8221; He estimated that with Recover, TrueAccord cut litigation volumes by a third.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>To get the other &#8532;, he told me, they need to rethink the entire system. That&#8217;s why partnering with fintech companies early, before consumers get into trouble, is so key.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>When TrueAccord started, he said, consumer lending meant Lending Club, who sold debt to debt buyers, who sued to collect. Regulation can help move things more digital, and technology can work to make the existing system a little bit better, but <strong>Ohad wants to rebuild the whole thing</strong>. (This is the kind of sentence you&#8217;d read in a shitty article, too, but you have to meet Ohad &#8211; he&#8217;s made his money; this is a mission for him).&nbsp;</p><p>That&#8217;s why Retain is both good business, but also the fastest way to help people avoid debt traps and the helplessness that comes with falling deeply behind.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re bringing financial services into the new world. We need to use this opportunity to work with fintechs and put a proactive plan in place to not sue people.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>Retain, he hopes, will give companies the plug-and-play tech tools &#8211; the &#8220;AWS for consumer debt and delinquency&#8221; &#8211; that they can use to solve problems before they get too far. So that they can avoid having to sue, so that consumers can stop getting hit with confusing court cases and unexpected wage garnishment and get back to building back their credit.&nbsp;</p><p>The mission&#8217;s the same as it was when I met Ohad a year ago, but TrueAccord&#8217;s taking a slightly different path, and the vision and opportunity have gotten bigger along the way. It&#8217;s even kind of sexy now.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Not Boring Talent Collective</h3><p><em>If you ever read about a company in Not Boring and think, &#8220;I wish I could work there,&#8221; then you should apply to join the Not Boring Talent Collective.

We&#8217;ll all have our <strong>genomes sequenced and actually know how to use the information</strong>. We&#8217;ll be able to <strong>tell the AI our goals</strong> &#8211; more energy, lose weight, avoid cancer &#8211; and it will be able to do things like order &#8220;the perfect meal for that moment for me: for my mood, for my genome, for my blood contents&#8221; via drone, automatically.&nbsp;</p><p>Most humans see a scenario in which computers know more than we do and tell us what to do as dystopian. He thinks they&#8217;re wrong. He thinks it sounds incredible:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>If we all had this, we would not look back and be like, &#8220;I wish I was making awful choices every day like I was in the past.&#8221; I think <strong>we&#8217;ll all be so much healthier</strong>. When we look back today, <strong>one of the things that&#8217;s going to look so primitive is the one-size-fits-all thing</strong>, like reading advice about keto. <strong>Each genome is going to have very specific, unique advice</strong> coming from AI. </em>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>I was running (NBD) when I heard that, and I nearly tripped. Tim Urban was laying out the precise thesis for a Not Boring portfolio company: <strong><a href="https://www.fount.bio/">Fount</a></strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>The last time we&#8217;d spoken before I listened to that podcast, <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewHerrBio">Andrew Herr</a>, the wizard CEO and founder of Fount, described practically the same end-state that Tim did: &#8220;What people really want is to <strong>quickly and easily</strong> know what they should <strong>eat, take, and do</strong> to <strong>look, feel, and perform</strong> how they want.&#8221;</p><p>Getting to that end-state has been the holy grail &#8230; or &#8230; fount ... of health and wellness for a long time. Nothing has come close to working at scale. One-size-fits-all solutions don&#8217;t work. Throwing a lot of poor quality data at the problem doesn&#8217;t work.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem is that <strong>knowing about what&#8217;s going on in the body doesn&#8217;t yet tell you what to do</strong>. The body is so complex that we haven&#8217;t come close to modeling it yet (see: <em><a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/the-laboratory-for-complex-problems?s=w">The Laboratory for Complex Problems</a></em> for the category of problem we&#8217;re dealing with). As Andrew explained, even the gut is more complex than a rocket, let alone the brain, and the interactions among all of the different pieces compound the complexity. Rocket scientists at least have physics to guide them; we haven&#8217;t figured these rules out yet for the body.&nbsp;</p><p>Gathering lots of poor quality data &#8211; observational studies, small clinical trials, even big trials that only look at one intervention &#8211; doesn&#8217;t capture the variability between humans or the synergies between different interventions. What&#8217;s needed is <strong>experimental data</strong>.</p><p>As we&#8217;ll dive into, the path to <strong>personalized health recommendations at scale</strong> starts with recruiting thousands of people, <strong>running dozens of the right kinds of experiments on each person over a period of months to years (but different ones for each person), and gathering data continuously throughout the process so you have rich pre- and post- data sets for each experiment</strong>. If most clinical data collection is 5 question multiple choice, this approach is War and Peace-length choose-your-own adventure.</p><p>Personalized health recommendations are the necessary first step towards the world Urban described, and towards healthier, happier people with less wasted healthcare spend, but collecting the data is so daunting that no one has even tried. Think about it:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>How would you <strong>convince thousands of people</strong> to <strong>run dozens of experiments on themselves</strong>?&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Who would <strong>design, manage, and update</strong> all of those <strong>experiments in real time</strong>?</p></li><li><p>How would you <strong>track data</strong> and <strong>ensure people were doing what you asked and telling the truth about what happened</strong>?&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>How much would it <strong>cost</strong>?&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>I mean, put yourself in the question: <strong>how much would someone need to pay </strong><em><strong>you </strong></em><strong>to run dozens of experiments on you?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>$5,000 per month.&nbsp;</p><p>No, sorry, that&#8217;s not <em>my</em> answer.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>$5,000 per month is how much clients </strong><em><strong>pay Fount</strong></em><strong> to run experiments on them and collect their data</strong>. Happily. (It drops to $1,000 per month after the three-month onboarding period.)</p><p>Because Fount&#8217;s data collection mechanism is a <strong>world-class concierge wellness and performance coaching program</strong> developed by the guy who <strong>led human performance and biotech strategy efforts for the US Military </strong>and carried out by ex-Special Ops Performance Advisors.</p><p>Fount <strong>flipped the equation</strong> on its head. Instead of applying for government grants to spend thousands per person recruiting participants and running studies on them, people are knocking down Fount&#8217;s doors and paying thousands of dollars for Fount to run experiments on them.</p><p>If that strategy sounds familiar, that&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the <strong>Tesla playbook</strong>. Make something that&#8217;s good for the world so sexy that people line up to pay up.&nbsp;</p><p>Like the Roadster, Fount&#8217;s price tag was a shock at first. It is &#8230; not approachable for 99.99% of people today. But it&#8217;s a best-in-class experience, and there are many people for whom the ROI is absurdly favorable.&nbsp;</p><p>LeBron spends over $1 million on his body and mind per year, and he&#8217;s had to put a team of people together to pull it off. Fount does that all for you, so it's not only best-in-class knowledge, it's made for real people who can't focus on their body as their full time job. Especially when it's made easy, there's no shortage of people in tech, Hollywood, and pro sports willing and able to pay $24k to improve theirs. If you&#8217;ve made a lot of money in crypto but feel burnt out, for example, Fount might be for you.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ShaneBattier">Shane Battier</a>, an NCAA National Champion at Duke, NBA Champion with the Heat, NBA executive, and investor, who&#8217;s now a Fount client, told me why Fount makes sense for him:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>I check on my bank statement, my kids&#8217; grades, and even the oil levels in my car at fairly regular intervals. Why wouldn&#8217;t I check in on my own health outside my annual checkup with my doctor? Andrew Herr and Fount are the best way for me to <strong>&#8216;check in on&#8217; and optimize my health in a more precise way</strong>.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>The goal is much bigger than just serving the top 0.01%, though. Andrew could have done that on his own. Fount wants to help <em>everyone</em> improve their health and performance. To get there, the company plans to leverage the top end of the market&#8217;s willingness to pay for best-in-class service <em>today</em> in order to collect the data it needs to bring costs down to mass market levels over time.&nbsp;</p><p>When a company starts ultra high-end to fund early production before ramping production and lowering costs, people <em>always</em> compare it to Tesla, like I just did. Usually, the comparison is full of shit, like when any money-losing company cites Amazon&#8217;s years of losses as justification.&nbsp;</p><p>In this case, <strong>I don&#8217;t think that specific Tesla comparison goes </strong><em><strong>far enough</strong></em>. Tim Urban's optimism on the Lex Fridman podcast isn't just about the technology - he believes that the <em>way</em> Elon Musk builds companies is key to upgrading the future. Fount is building in the same way.&nbsp;</p><p>Five years ago, on 4/20 (woah &#129327;) 2017, Urban wrote one of his all-time greats, the six-part, 36,027 word <em><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html">Neuralink and the Brain&#8217;s Magical Future</a>.&nbsp;</em></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3a961e7-0556-479a-bd55-28108041533f_1096x1544.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3a961e7-0556-479a-bd55-28108041533f_1096x1544.png" width="326" height="459.2554744525547" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b3a961e7-0556-479a-bd55-28108041533f_1096x1544.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1544,&quot;width&quot;:1096,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:326,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3a961e7-0556-479a-bd55-28108041533f_1096x1544.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3a961e7-0556-479a-bd55-28108041533f_1096x1544.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3a961e7-0556-479a-bd55-28108041533f_1096x1544.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3a961e7-0556-479a-bd55-28108041533f_1096x1544.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Tim Urban, Wait But Why&nbsp;</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>The essay is about Elon Musk&#8217;s brain-machine interface company, <a href="https://neuralink.com/">Neuralink</a>, which Urban compares to a <strong>Wizard Hat</strong>.

He shared the investment memo that he wrote at the time, in which he described Andrew&#8217;s upbringing and education:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>Andrew was born to a gastroenterologist father and a mother who worked for American Airlines and came from a decorated military family. Unsurprisingly, Andrew grew up fascinated by the best parts of medicine and international affairs&#8230;</em></p><p><em>When applying to college, there was only one program that combined both of these interests, while also offering daily access to opportunities for real-world experience: the Science, Technology, and International Affairs program&#8212;then an obscure major, but now the most popular &#8212; at <strong>Georgetown&#8217;s famed School of Foreign Service</strong> in Washington, DC&#8230;</em></p><p><em>Outside the classroom, Andrew worked with several US Government agencies on protecting the U.S. against terrorist and state threats by deploying advanced technologies, in the process <strong>winning a full scholarship from the U.S. Government for his research</strong>.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>After his full undergrad scholarship, Andrew won another $200k scholarship from the government to continue his studies with <strong>three concurrent masters</strong>: Microbiology &amp; Immunology, Health Physics, and Security Studies.&nbsp;</p><p>You can read the whole bio section from that memo <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17_vodCUW-01rxZaXtTqldhmHjRnci5zzIIauhEhjpZE/edit">here</a>. The takeaway is this: <strong>Andrew was practically designed in a lab by the U.S. Government to build Fount and fix health and human performance at scale.</strong></p><p>When the Pentagon&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Net_Assessment">Office of Net Assessment</a> needed to hire a researcher &#8220;who had a deep knowledge of biology, was just as deep in national security, <em>who thought creatively, and could also write well,</em>&#8221; he was one of the few people in the country with the right mix of skills and knowledge. He was hired after one interview, and while there, &#8220;started his decade-long project to understand what processes in the body he could tap into to materially enhance performance and which tools he could use to do this.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>Over time, Andrew went from developing specific studies and programs to helping the <strong>Department of Defense leadership invest its multi-billion dollar R&amp;D budget</strong>, with a focus on <strong>human performance, synthetic biology, and AI</strong>.

The <strong>US Military&#8217;s annual budget in 2021 was $778 billion</strong>. Behind Social Security and Health spending, it&#8217;s the largest budget in the US, and the largest discretionary budget bar none, likely in the world. And <strong>the US Government chose Andrew to lead cutting edge human performance and biotech efforts for that military, putting the performance of the world&#8217;s most expensive and advanced soldiers in his hands.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>While the military is rigid in certain areas, it doesn&#8217;t subscribe to any orthodoxy when it comes to the performance of its soldiers. It&#8217;s the best-funded human performance lab in the world, and it offers an additional benefit beyond the money: soldiers who, unlike normal trial participants, want to comply with any programs or experiments that could enhance them.</p><p>Andrew&#8217;s experience improving human performance from within the government&#8217;s third-highest spend category gave him the skills necessary to try to dramatically improve results and lower costs in its highest: <strong>healthcare</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2019, he launched Fount to rethink health from the ground up.

There&#8217;s some <strong>technological shortcoming</strong> that&#8217;s preventing the industry from taking off.</em></p></blockquote><p>In the case of individualized healthcare, that shortcoming is the <strong>biomedical data gap</strong>. That&#8217;s the <strong>Starting Point</strong>.</p><h3><strong>The Biomedical Data Gap&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Andrew loves clean data. He uses words like &#8220;exquisite&#8221; to describe data. Problem is, we don&#8217;t have enough exquisite data.&nbsp;</p><p>To get to the future that both Urban and Andrew describe &#8211; people quickly and easily know what they should eat, take, and do to look, feel, and perform how they want &#8211; requires <strong>highly accurate predictive models</strong>. The hard part isn&#8217;t the models themselves. We know how to build the right models. <strong>The challenge is the data.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>According to Andrew, &#8220;all of the biomedical data sets available today, or that anyone is working on, have <strong>one or more fatal flaws</strong> that prevent us from building these models&#8221; (I&#8217;m just going to quote him since he&#8217;s the scientist):&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p><em>They are <strong>observational</strong>, so they <strong>miss most of the important covariates</strong> and <strong>can&#8217;t ascribe causality</strong>. This works in marketing, but in health/wellness it&#8217;s a disaster. This approach is what gave us innovations like the &#8216;sugar is ok, but fat is evil' mantra that persisted for decades and gave millions of people diabetes.</em></p></li><li><p><em>The vast majority of experimental trials have <strong>tiny sample sizes</strong>. Anyone who&#8217;s run a clinical trial can tell you that <strong>n = 20 or 30 people isn&#8217;t going to tell you much</strong>. I ran one with 400+ subjects, and even that was too small.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Even in bigger trials, <strong>researchers collect sparse data about their subjects and the response</strong>. They <strong>only</strong> <strong>want to show an intervention &#8220;works,&#8221;</strong> and <strong>more data is costly and will potentially show unwanted effects</strong>. So, when an intervention &#8216;works&#8217; (on average), it may only have helped something like 60% of participants, did nothing for 20%, and hurt 20%, and there is <strong>no way to predict whether you&#8217;re in the 20% or the 60%</strong>.</em></p></li><li><p><em>And even well-designed trials <strong>almost never try more than one intervention at the same time</strong>, so you have <strong>no way to understand synergistic effects</strong>, good or bad, that may result when combining diets, supplements, sleep tools, etc.</em></p></li></ol><p>According to Andrew &#8211; and Fount <strong>COO Clayton Kim</strong>, who led machine learning engineering at Wayfair prior to joining Fount &#8211; you need a seemingly crazy data set to build highly accurate predictive models that could deliver personalized recommendations, experiments, adjustments, and plans. Specifically, you&#8217;d need to run &#8220;dozens of <strong>experiments</strong> per person, across thousands of people, with rich pre- and post- data for each experiment.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>You&#8217;d need to get comprehensive blood tests, understand habits like sleep, exercise, and diet, orient around goals, and then design experiments across a variety of categories &#8211; nutrition, supplements, meditation and cognitive tools, sleep, light, temperature, exercise, and recovery &#8211; track results with wearables, more blood tests, and conversations, and then adjust and run more experiments.&nbsp;</p><p><em>If</em> you could pull that off, though, you&#8217;d have that exquisite data you&#8217;d need to build the predictive models. According to Andrew, <strong>experimental data</strong> isn&#8217;t just the best data, it&#8217;s the <strong>only data that works for the goal</strong>. When you increase the number of experiments you do per person, that&#8217;s when the magic really starts to happen. This is not a problem where you can just throw a ton of OK data at the problem and make it up with good models.

The process was smooth despite that &#8211; Thea on the Fount team set it all up and gave me instructions for the whole process.

Personalized diet (which I only did an OK job following tbh) and supplement regimen.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Resilience. </strong>Supplements to support my immune system.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Cognitive. </strong>Meditation routine and guided meditations, plus the amino acid l-theanine to support calm energy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sleep. </strong>They threw everything at sleep: light filtering glasses, Hue color changing lights, nighttime shower and meditation, nasal rinse, recommendations on when to stop eating and drinking, and sleep supplements.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Exercise &amp; Recovery. </strong>The Fount program comes with WRKOUT training sessions included. They&#8217;re live video sessions with a top-notch trainer &#8211; shout out to Marc! &#8211; as many times a week as you&#8217;d like.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Supplements.</strong> A meta-category that wove through and supported the others.</p></li></ol><p>To give you a sense for how detailed and personalized things get, take how Andrew talked me through whether I should eat breakfast or not. Peep the footnote<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a> for Andrew&#8217;s full explanation, but the long and short of it is this:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>If you Google &#8220;should I eat breakfast,&#8221; you&#8217;ll find that t<strong>he answer is definitely yes, definitely no, and also maybe</strong>, but we now have an understanding of why <strong>eating in the morning can help some people and may hurt others</strong>&#8230;</em></p><p><em>When we looked at your labs, your wearable data, and your interview data, <strong>it looked like you had both high inflammation and sensitivity to stress hormones, so we experimented</strong>&#8230; We tested what happened when we supported you via supplements to keep your inflammatory levels in the optimal range and then <strong>added breakfast to support your brain, and voila, much more energy and focus when you wanted it</strong>!</em></p></blockquote><p>Ultimately, <strong>one size does not fit all</strong>; it doesn&#8217;t even always fit the same person! And that was just one of dozens of experiments.&nbsp;</p><p>Everything in the program is supported in the <strong>app</strong>, where I could check in each day to see what I needed to do &#8211; when to meditate, what to eat, what supplements to take when, etc&#8230; &#8211; stay in touch with my team for any questions, and take notes on what I&#8217;m feeling, all in one place.</p><p>The whole program is designed to make it as <strong>easy as possible to comply</strong>.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>If you drink and want to keep drinking, that&#8217;s more than OK. They&#8217;ll work to mitigate the effects.</p></li><li><p>Only want to work out twice a week? Fine.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>I asked for blue blocker glasses that were less intense so I could use them while I worked, and they sent them the next day.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>When I went to a friend&#8217;s bachelor party in Las Vegas, Andrew sent me his famous FlyKitt, which kills jet lag, and a hangover fighting kit. Hand to god, it worked.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>When I tweaked my hip running, Andrew hooked me up with a top physical therapist who gave me three stretches I&#8217;d never tried and fixed it in a session.</p></li></ul><p>To show the extent they&#8217;re willing to go to for customer experience and convenience, they built their own custom <strong>supplement packaging facility</strong>. They know that no one is going to take supplements from 7 different bottles every day, so they send personalized pre-packed supplements by time of day.

These check-ins are crucial for gathering data that they might not be able to get through tests. Every time we spoke, Andrew asked &#8220;Anything else you&#8217;ve noticed?&#8221; three or four times, hoping to uncover little connections. I was legit shocked when I&#8217;d describe something little that I&#8217;d barely noticed until he asked, and he&#8217;d say something like, &#8220;I thought so, that&#8217;s probably x, y, and z happening.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>I also had <strong>monthly blood tests</strong> to understand what was happening in my body and adjust the program accordingly. In the early tests, my labs actually weren&#8217;t moving as much as we would have liked in a couple of areas and I was still a little groggy in the morning. So we re-worked the plan &#8211; new supplements, diet tweaks, cut Snus, put on the blue light glasses earlier &#8211; and kept checking in. The labs and energy levels came right along.</p><p>When work was cutting into my sleep time the week of ConstitutionDAO, they designed an optimal napping program (turns out shorter can be better!) and Guy gave me his pushup and squat program to use for a pickup between meetings. Then they&#8217;d check in again to see if it worked, and keep or tweak pieces accordingly.&nbsp;</p><p>This is crucial &#8211; when I wrote about <strong>experimental data</strong> above, this is what I&#8217;m talking about. Andrew would form hypotheses, test interventions, measure the results, tweak, and try again. They capture it all on the backend. I happily gave Fount that data because it made me healthier and higher-performing. The combination of feeling better subjectively and having objective data to show the benefits is very powerful.</p><p><em>Note: Fount is not in the business of selling my or any client&#8217;s data. It&#8217;s their competitive advantage.&nbsp;</em></p><p>So did it work?&nbsp;</p><p>The proof is in the labs. As of my last lab tests, I&#8217;ve improved in every area we identified in the beginning:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>My <strong>fasting blood sugar improved</strong> from 96 to 86 md/dl</p></li><li><p>My <strong>Red Blood Cell count went from an anemic 4.11 back to a healthy 4.61 million/ml</strong>, and my <strong>hemoglobin went from 12.8 to 14.3 g/dl</strong></p></li><li><p>My <strong>Vitamin B12 went from a functionally deficient 339 to a normal 501 pg/ml</strong></p></li><li><p>My <strong>omega-3 levels doubled from a deficient 3.1% to a good 6.2%,</strong> on the way to optimal&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Even my <strong>testosterone went up from 572 to 625 ng/dl</strong></p></li></ul><p>I gave the numbers first because just saying, &#8220;And now I feel great!&#8221; doesn&#8217;t really mean too much. But I&#8217;m legitimately <strong>more energized</strong> and <strong>less stressed</strong> than I was before the Fount program. I went from <strong>Sleep Scores</strong> in the 70s before the program to consistent 80s and 90s now. I <strong>wrote more than 25,000 words</strong> in the past week alone. I have a gauntlet month writing-wise ahead &#8211; something like eight pieces in four weeks &#8211; and I&#8217;m not worried about it.&nbsp;</p><p>All-in-all, even if I&#8217;d paid full price, the program would have returned itself many times over already, and it&#8217;s ongoing. Now that I&#8217;m through the three-month <strong>Core</strong> program, I&#8217;m staying on the <strong>Support </strong>program: I still have supplements coming, less regular blood tests, monthly check-ins, and the ability to message Guy and Andrew whenever something comes up.&nbsp;It feels like how a billionaire would manage their health.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#8217;s a win-win: I get a billionaire-level performance coach and program on-call, and they get to continue to collect my data to make this level of optimization available to everyone.</p><p>The question is: <strong>how can Fount scale that magic?&nbsp;</strong></p><h3><strong>Scaling Fount&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Fount has a <strong>Sustainable Business Model</strong> today: at $5,000 per month for the three-month Core program and $1,000 per month for the ongoing Support program, a long waitlist, growing corporate sales, and software-level margins, high-end health and performance advisory is a very good business.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9158c910-260b-4fe2-97ed-5f1fed0c20bb_900x620.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9158c910-260b-4fe2-97ed-5f1fed0c20bb_900x620.png" width="900" height="620" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9158c910-260b-4fe2-97ed-5f1fed0c20bb_900x620.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:620,&quot;width&quot;:900,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9158c910-260b-4fe2-97ed-5f1fed0c20bb_900x620.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9158c910-260b-4fe2-97ed-5f1fed0c20bb_900x620.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9158c910-260b-4fe2-97ed-5f1fed0c20bb_900x620.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9158c910-260b-4fe2-97ed-5f1fed0c20bb_900x620.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>But remember the Elon Musk Company Formula. The current business is just the Sustainable Business Model that funds the <strong>Company Innovation</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>So Fount needs to scale beyond its current approach in order to improve humans&#8217; health and performance, lower the incidence of chronic illnesses, and allow people to achieve more. It&#8217;s doing that in two stages:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p><strong>Scaling the data collection and experimentation machine (Company Innovation)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Using that data to build predictive models of how the body and brain work in order to optimize them at scale (Match)&nbsp;</strong></p></li></ol><p>Fount could get to Stage II without optimizing Stage I, it would just take longer. But there&#8217;s an <strong>urgency</strong> to Fount&#8217;s mission: the faster they collect exquisite data from 5,000 people (and beyond) and build models with it, the faster they can start improving lives at scale.</p><p>So let&#8217;s dive into Stage I.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing you might notice from that last section is that it&#8217;s very hands-on. It doesn&#8217;t seem particularly scalable for the CEO to get on every check-in call with a schlub like me. So Andrew has figured out how to replicate himself, by training elite coaches, so that Fount can <strong>build the dataset to automate Andrew and enhance Automated Andrew with better and better predictive models</strong>.</p><p>In the beginning, Andrew needed to be involved in everything. There was no software. There was no team. There was no data. There was no shared knowledge. It was all in his head.&nbsp;</p><p>Slowly, as he grew the team, built software, tuned ops, refined an internal training program, and shared knowledge, he lowered the percentage of situations that call for his or others&#8217; expertise. Now, the Fount Performance Advisors can handle any standard situation and most that used to feel like edge cases.

It&#8217;s <strong>not one-size-fits-all</strong>; it&#8217;s &#8220;run experiments with each client until something works, then add the learnings to the toolkit.&#8221;</p><p>Fount had a client who was taking his company public. Because of a tough childhood, the client&#8217;s sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight response) is turned up so high that if he uses any stimulants like caffeine, he can&#8217;t sleep. But he needs to focus. So the Fount team tried a few things:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>They tried stimulants that usually lower stress levels and don&#8217;t normally impact sleep, but they did in this client.</p></li><li><p>Then they tried various types of meditation. It didn&#8217;t work, because the problem was in the body, not just the mind.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Then they tried breathwork, which helped the client&#8217;s sleep, but not his focus.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Then Andrew paused and took a few days to reconceptualize the problem.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Andrew knew that (in a very reductionist sense) focus requires activation of the brain&#8217;s <strong>reward and drive pathways</strong>. Staying reductionist, these equate roughly to the roles of dopamine and adrenaline. So he asked - <strong>what if we increase dopamine without increasing adrenaline?</strong> What if he gave the client a mix of <strong>dopamine precursors </strong>with the <strong>breathwork</strong>?</p><p>That was the solution. The client told Andrew it gave him <strong>&#8220;95% of the effects of Adderall, but I can sleep</strong>,&#8221; and he successfully took his company public.</p><p>Figuring out the right reconceptualization of the problem was really hard and took Andrew&#8217;s decade-plus worth of experience and knowledge to figure out. But now, it&#8217;s just a tool in the Fount toolkit that all the Performance Advisors know how to use. <strong>It doesn&#8217;t work for everyone, even for everyone who has a similar setup to that client, but for the people it works for, it&#8217;s magic</strong>. And Andrew told me, with that look that I get when I brag about Dev, that his Performance Advisors now solve edge cases he hadn&#8217;t run across before without him.&nbsp;</p><p>With each edge case Andrew &amp; team solve, they identify new tools and get faster and faster at <strong>figuring out which magic will work for which person</strong>&#8230; and<strong> </strong>then run tests, collect data, and keep improving the models so clients get results faster and faster. Each time, the amount of things Andrew is needed for shrinks. Each red sliver that goes from Andrew&#8217;s brain into software becomes another reinforcement in <strong>Fount&#8217;s moat</strong>.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F488276ec-7b1b-431a-9967-9f17169d007f_1181x658.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F488276ec-7b1b-431a-9967-9f17169d007f_1181x658.png" width="1181" height="658" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/488276ec-7b1b-431a-9967-9f17169d007f_1181x658.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:658,&quot;width&quot;:1181,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F488276ec-7b1b-431a-9967-9f17169d007f_1181x658.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F488276ec-7b1b-431a-9967-9f17169d007f_1181x658.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F488276ec-7b1b-431a-9967-9f17169d007f_1181x658.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F488276ec-7b1b-431a-9967-9f17169d007f_1181x658.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Put another way, each time Andrew or someone on the Fount team solves a new challenge, it increases the gap between what Fount knows and what a human expert knows, <em>and</em> increases the gap between Fount&#8217;s <em>ability</em> <em>to figure the next one out</em> and a normal expert&#8217;s.

Fount is trying to do the same thing for the human body.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the edge case solutions, Fount has increasingly optimized its ability to collect the best data from clients efficiently. Today, this is what they collect from each client:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>115 lab data points every month</p></li><li><p>30 minute video check-ins weekly</p></li><li><p>20+ wearable data points daily</p></li><li><p>1-5 app-based prompts answers daily</p></li><li><p>5 Factor Personality Data</p></li></ul><p>Soon, they&#8217;ll be adding <strong>genetics</strong>, <strong>epigenetic markers</strong>, <strong>full-body MRI</strong>, <strong>body composition</strong>, <strong>medical records data</strong>, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Importantly, they&#8217;re building up a library of not just what works for which types of people, but also<strong> when and in what order</strong>. They&#8217;re developing an understanding of softer things, too, like how to sequence interventions to increase adherence. For example, they typically start with &#8220;easier wins&#8221; like nutrition and supplements before building up enough extra energy and buy-in from clients to get them to, say, meditate regularly (if that&#8217;s what they need to reach their goals).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, in Scaling Stage I, Fount is simultaneously building up the team, operational muscles, experimental data, software, and institutional knowledge to get ready to really scale.&nbsp;</p><p>That&#8217;s Fount 2.0.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Fount 2.0&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>The Fount Concierge program that I went through is the gold standard. It&#8217;s hard to imagine a more comprehensive, white glove experience than the one Fount currently offers. The product is essentially <strong>access to a world-class team dedicated to running personalized experiments and providing tools and interventions to help you meet whatever physical or mental goals you set</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>But that only scales to a point. <strong>$5,000 per month is a non-starter for 99.99% of people</strong>. And remember, the goal here isn&#8217;t to build a profitable small business, it&#8217;s to <strong>increase human and financial capital available to build a better future</strong>. For that, Fount needs to scale access to Andrew and his team and drive down costs.&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily, the world of software has figured out a solution: <strong>APIs</strong>.</p><p>In <em><a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/apis-all-the-way-down?s=w">APIs All the Way Down</a></em>, I wrote:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>When a company chooses to plug in a third-party API, it&#8217;s <strong>essentially deciding to hire that entire company to handle a whole function within its business</strong>. Imagine copying in some code and getting the <strong>Collison brothers to run your Finance team</strong>.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>At this point, no company in the world could afford to hire the Collisons to run their Finance team, but every company can afford to plug in Stripe&#8217;s APIs and get access to a suite of financial products designed by the Collisons and the people they&#8217;ve hired, <strong>enhanced by the huge volume of data across Stripe&#8217;s customer base</strong>. Stripe has thousands of smart people and trillions of data points with which to solve problems, cover edge cases, and continuously learn and evolve narrowly-focused products.&nbsp;</p><p>That&#8217;s a key point: <strong>every company would now be </strong><em><strong>better off</strong></em><strong> using Stripe&#8217;s APIs than hiring Patrick and John to code payment acceptance and identity solutions for them</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>While Fount says that it&#8217;s building an <strong>operating system for the human body</strong>, what it&#8217;s really building in the short-term is a <strong>set of health &amp; performance APIs that allow you to access the collective knowledge of the Fount team and toolkit they&#8217;re building on top of their unique data set</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3dca54a-bfdf-4fae-a84a-9bca51cc0495_908x594.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3dca54a-bfdf-4fae-a84a-9bca51cc0495_908x594.png" width="908" height="594" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b3dca54a-bfdf-4fae-a84a-9bca51cc0495_908x594.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:594,&quot;width&quot;:908,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3dca54a-bfdf-4fae-a84a-9bca51cc0495_908x594.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3dca54a-bfdf-4fae-a84a-9bca51cc0495_908x594.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3dca54a-bfdf-4fae-a84a-9bca51cc0495_908x594.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3dca54a-bfdf-4fae-a84a-9bca51cc0495_908x594.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>After Fount uses its concierge offering to collect the experimental data across 5,000 or so people (which it will obviously keep expanding from there), it can build predictive models that would allow it to turn the core Fount program into a dramatically lower-cost software product: <strong>Fount 2.0</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>In under two years, Fount expects to have that product live. That would mean that for maybe fifty dollars a month, about what the average American spends on supplements monthly, people will be able to access an <strong>experience like working with Andrew and Guy, right in the app, supercharged by a growing corpus of experimental data and predictive models.</strong></p><p>That doesn&#8217;t mean that we&#8217;re quite at the end-state that Tim Urban described &#8211; the perfect, personalized, health-optimizing meal delivered at just the right time &#8211; but that software will be able to help you run the experiments to find what&#8217;s optimal for you. As Andrew described it:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>Considering how complex the body is, it&#8217;s very hard to make software that can just give people the perfect answer for their health or performance off the bat. Instead, with our initial data set we will be able to <strong>design a software system that can give people the optimal path of experimentation to get to the right answer</strong>.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Start with the goals &#8211; you want to achieve X &amp; Y &#8211; and we&#8217;ll tell you which blood tests to get done, surveys to take, and wearables to use, so we can establish a baseline and understand your unique characteristics. Then, we can <strong>design 5-10 experiments that get you to the right program and results within 30 days</strong>, and continue to adjust based on data and your feedback.</em></p></blockquote><p>From a business model perspective, Fount evisions charging a low monthly fee for the software and digital program so that it&#8217;s accessible for millions of people &#8211; which is better for the world <em>and </em>for Fount&#8217;s moat &#8211; then layering on upgrades for supplements, coaching, trainers, additional blood tests, more wearables, and even <strong>meal delivery</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>My biggest feedback on the program was that instead of just telling me what to eat, they should actually just send every meal that I need to my door, leaving me no room to stray. I didn&#8217;t eat as well as I should have despite <em>knowing</em> what to eat, because I&#8217;m human and I&#8217;m lazy.

It could even algorithmically update meal kits to subtly run experiments without any mental load on clients. They already vary supplements week-to-week, and sometimes within the week, to do this. A meal kit competitor would need something more than a free first box to pull me away from the company that&#8217;s designing meals to my specific biomarkers.&nbsp;</p><p>Fount&#8217;s opportunity in meal kits hints at the biggest hidden secret in this business: <strong>the many, many things that Fount can do to improve human health and performance &#8211; both on its own and by igniting the industry &#8211; once it&#8217;s collected enough exquisite data.</strong></p><h3><strong>Increased Chance of a Good Future&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>In all of Elon Musk&#8217;s companies, the Sustainable Business Model funds the <strong>Company Innovation, </strong>which it uses to light a <strong>Match That Ignites An Industry</strong>.</p><p>Urban gave examples of such matches pre-Elon:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fced76cd8-8678-45fc-9ade-d485de8d8c3d_1483x432.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fced76cd8-8678-45fc-9ade-d485de8d8c3d_1483x432.png" width="1456" height="424" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ced76cd8-8678-45fc-9ade-d485de8d8c3d_1483x432.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:424,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fced76cd8-8678-45fc-9ade-d485de8d8c3d_1483x432.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fced76cd8-8678-45fc-9ade-d485de8d8c3d_1483x432.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fced76cd8-8678-45fc-9ade-d485de8d8c3d_1483x432.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fced76cd8-8678-45fc-9ade-d485de8d8c3d_1483x432.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>These are BIG fucking matches.

Yes.&#8221;</p><blockquote><p><em>We've moved from systems that can be modeled from the top down using computing and physics to systems that are so complex and varied that we have to <strong>start from phenomena and use those to derive models</strong> - which will then help us to <strong>understand the systems and build tools for them</strong>.</em></p><p><em>You can build a rocket and understand essentially all the physics around it today, but <strong>we can&#8217;t even model one human effectively, let alone understand the general rules that govern humans with real fidelity</strong>. But it&#8217;s worse than that - <strong>we can&#8217;t even model one part of the system effectively because just one part of the human system, take the gut for example, is more complex than a rocket</strong>. Let alone the brain. Or at least they are<strong> until we build the data from which to understand them and unravel this complexity</strong>.</em></p></blockquote><p>Now, this is obviously going to be really fucking hard to pull off. There&#8217;s a disclaimer that I should put at the top of every Not Boring to keep from repeating myself: <strong>the odds are that Fount </strong><em><strong>won&#8217;t</strong></em><strong> pull this off</strong>. The companies that are ultimately most impactful are probably the ones with the odds stacked highest against them at the start. Fount&#8217;s is an absurdly ambitious goal. If it pulls it off and builds this model, it will be worth tens or hundreds of billions of dollars; the current valuation reflects a steep discount rate on that future.&nbsp;</p><p>But Andrew and the Fount team have the best chance of anyone I&#8217;ve come across to build the predictive model of the body and the brain. If it does, the opportunities are enormous, for Fount itself, and for humanity.&nbsp;</p><p>First, as we&#8217;ve discussed, will be <strong>Fount 2.0</strong>: Andrew, in app form, supercharged by data and models.&nbsp;</p><p>By bringing the price down by two orders of magnitude, Fount will be able to improve the health and performance of many, many more people and grow the business substantially. Over <a href="https://us.myprotein.com/thezone/training/much-americans-spend-health-fitness-survey-results-revealed/">20 million Americans</a> already spend more than $100 per month on supplements. Even Equinox, at a much higher price point, has 350,000 members, and they&#8217;re limited by physical proximity and space. More importantly, though, many more members will mean two things:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p><strong>Expert Vortex.</strong> API-first companies tend to pull in many of the people who care the most about, and are the best in the world at, the specific thing the API-first company addresses. That makes the company even better at solving all of the hardest problems in the space, and even more of a no-brainer. If there are ten Andrews in the world, or maybe 10 true experts in each micro area of health and performance, Fount should be able to pull a bunch of them in to solve an increasing number of edge cases and ensure that Fount stays cutting edge in every area it helps clients.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>More Exquisite Data</strong>. If Fount can build <em>the</em> predictive model that delivers great results for 70% of the population across ten major categories like energy and muscle with experimental data from just 5,000 people, getting <strong>experimental data from hundreds of thousands of people</strong> should help it continuously improve the model, serve more people, and address more goals. They will discover brand new approaches no one expected. And they will get better at ordering interventions and making the program as easy to comply with as possible so that more people stick with it, even if they don&#8217;t have a coach.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>From there, things start getting really crazy.&nbsp;</p><p>Fount has an opportunity to build the <strong>platform</strong> that others &#8211; entrepreneurs, pharmaceutical companies, and more &#8211; can plug into to work together towards the goal. The core asset that Fount is building up is that <strong>rich, exquisite experimental data</strong>, and that data might be incredibly valuable to companies beyond Fount, even when they aren&#8217;t selling the data.&nbsp;</p><p>What might that look like? Just a few examples:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Clinical Trial Recruitment</strong>. It&#8217;s hard and expensive for pharma companies to find the right people for clinical trials, and they&#8217;re often willing to pay thousands of dollars per person to find participants. Fount can pre-qualify people based on their physiology and goals and match them with trials that might help them. Fount customers win because they get preferential access to new therapeutics, and the pharma company gets the people they need and a massive amount of data to understand who each participant is, if the Fount customer chooses to share.</p></li><li><p><strong>Develop Candidate Pharmaceuticals. I</strong>f Fount has the data, why not develop its own pharmaceuticals where lifestyle isn&#8217;t enough? It might be able to use its insights into the physiological effects of supplements and nutrition to develop drugs on its own, and its ability to predict what will work for whom and to understand side effects better will give it a leg up in clinical trials.</p></li><li><p><strong>Platform for Tech and Tools. </strong>Fount will have a good idea who will be interested in and respond best to new wearables and supplements, so it can either purchase and resell the best tech, tools, and supplements, or partner with the best products to give them targeted access.</p></li></ul><p>In all of these cases, it&#8217;s important to note, the outcomes are <strong>win-win-win</strong>. <strong>Clients</strong> win via access to the trials, drugs, tech, tools, and supplements best suited to help meet their goals. <strong>Partners</strong> win via more targeted and data-driven access to the right clients. And <strong>Fount</strong> wins by providing a better experience and outcomes to clients, strengthening its moats, and taking a cut of economic activity.&nbsp;</p><p>Most importantly, it wins by accelerating the future it wants to come true.&nbsp;</p><p>There&#8217;s a vision of this future in which Fount goes around the medical system entirely &#8211; and inspires other entrepreneurs to do the same &#8211; and replaces a big chunk of the primary care market.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F19419d58-f46c-4513-909c-3bf3bdc29a0e_864x663.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F19419d58-f46c-4513-909c-3bf3bdc29a0e_864x663.png" width="864" height="663" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/19419d58-f46c-4513-909c-3bf3bdc29a0e_864x663.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:663,&quot;width&quot;:864,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F19419d58-f46c-4513-909c-3bf3bdc29a0e_864x663.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F19419d58-f46c-4513-909c-3bf3bdc29a0e_864x663.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F19419d58-f46c-4513-909c-3bf3bdc29a0e_864x663.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F19419d58-f46c-4513-909c-3bf3bdc29a0e_864x663.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>But the one that Andrew&#8217;s more excited about is a future in which <strong>doctors use Fount to supercharge how they help patients</strong>.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3905f314-0964-4084-a46e-c8fab2ed331e_1151x1196.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3905f314-0964-4084-a46e-c8fab2ed331e_1151x1196.png" width="348" height="361.6055603822763" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3905f314-0964-4084-a46e-c8fab2ed331e_1151x1196.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1196,&quot;width&quot;:1151,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:348,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3905f314-0964-4084-a46e-c8fab2ed331e_1151x1196.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3905f314-0964-4084-a46e-c8fab2ed331e_1151x1196.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3905f314-0964-4084-a46e-c8fab2ed331e_1151x1196.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3905f314-0964-4084-a46e-c8fab2ed331e_1151x1196.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The average doctor gets less than 10 hours of training on nutrition.

When you flip it around and start from where Fount is today, the path gets more clear.</p><p>The <strong>Starting Point</strong> is that <strong>healthcare is broken</strong> &#8211; we spend too much money on managing diseases versus preventing or curing them, and we rarely optimize for performance. We&#8217;re <strong>wasting human and financial capital</strong>.</p><p>Today, Fount is in the &#8220;<strong>Sustainable Business Model&#8221; </strong>phase<strong>.</strong> Just like rich people have always been happy to spend on nice cars, they&#8217;ve also always been happy to spend on things that make them look, feel, and perform better. At $5,000 per month to start, Fount generates strong margins on real, and rapidly growing, revenue.&nbsp;</p><p>Fount 1.0 funds the <strong>Company Innovation</strong>, directly and with VC dollars. Fount&#8217;s innovation is that it will be the first organization &#8211; company, government, or university &#8211; to figure out how to <strong>collect the experimental data needed</strong> to build predictive models. The company&#8217;s best estimate is that that will take 5,000 people. You can <a href="https://www.fount.bio/notboring/">be one of them</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>That data will help Fount <strong>build predictive models of the brain and body </strong>that deliver real, measurable results to large numbers of people via software. If it pulls it off, the models will be the<strong> Match That Ignites an Industry.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>It will take a <strong>revolution in the way the industry approaches health</strong> and a <strong>wave of companies building powerful solutions on top of good data and models</strong> to get to that future. Many companies will build on top of Fount&#8217;s platform, others will compete.</p><p>If Fount is able to successfully ignite the industry, it could mean achieving the <strong>Goal</strong> of <strong>putting a big chunk of the $4 trillion we&#8217;d normally spend on healthcare annually in the US alone to more productive uses</strong>, helping people <strong>reduce stress and tension and increase self-understanding</strong>, and giving people the <strong>tools to maximize their potential</strong> (while still enjoying life to the fullest).</p><p>The <strong>Result of the Goal</strong>, if everything goes just right, will be to <strong>optimize people so that we can build an amazing future together</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Fount&#8217;s approach might just be crazy enough to work. If it does, we might get the future that Tim Urban predicted, with sensors, AI, and drones teaming up to deliver us the things we need to effortlessly stay healthy and perform our best. Fount is getting a headstart on building the predictive models that AI will use to deliver the right solutions at the right times.&nbsp;</p><p>Andrew pointed out that Neuralink data would actually be a great input to Fount models, and might even <em>need</em> something like Fount to really work in humans.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;If you want to <strong>overclock the brain</strong>, like Neuralink does,&#8221; Andrew pointed out, &#8220;It needs to be incredibly well-supported physiologically and can&#8217;t have interference from a poorly-functioning body. You need to optimize the whole.&#8221;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3596a778-95fe-4603-a86d-411f5480fdef_513x1124.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3596a778-95fe-4603-a86d-411f5480fdef_513x1124.png" width="167" height="365.9025341130604" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3596a778-95fe-4603-a86d-411f5480fdef_513x1124.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1124,&quot;width&quot;:513,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:167,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3596a778-95fe-4603-a86d-411f5480fdef_513x1124.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3596a778-95fe-4603-a86d-411f5480fdef_513x1124.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3596a778-95fe-4603-a86d-411f5480fdef_513x1124.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3596a778-95fe-4603-a86d-411f5480fdef_513x1124.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>The Future with Neuralink But No Fount</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>All this, starting from a $5,000 per month Concierge performance program and ending in an increased chance of a good future for humanity&#8230; mind-blowing.</p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Try Fount For Yourself</strong> </h3><p>Experiencing Fount for yourself beats reading about it.

It&#8217;s gonna turn into little sensors in our blood probably or even infrared, it&#8217;s going to be collecting 100 times more data than it collects now. More nuanced data, more specific to our body. That&#8217;s the hardware side.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>And then the software&#8217;s gonna be &#8211; and I have not done my deep dive, this is all speculation &#8211; the software&#8217;s gonna get really good. This is the AI component.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Think about if hardware were able to collect&#8230; first of all, the hardware knows your whole genome, and we know a lot more about what a genome sequence means. Because you can collect your genome now, we just don&#8217;t have much to do with that information. So you have your genome, you&#8217;ve got what&#8217;s in your blood at any given moment, all the levels of everything&#8230; It knows how fast your heart is beating, and it knows exactly the amount of exercise, it knows your muscle mass and weight and all that. Maybe even knows your emotions&#8230;&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Now the AI can go to town. Think about when the AI gets really good at this, and it knows your genome. I want the AI to just tell me what to do.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>OK how about this? Now imagine attaching that to a meal service, and the meal service has all the million ingredients and supplements and vitamins and everything, and I tell the AI my broad goals: I want to gain muscle, or I want to maintain my weight but I want to have more energy, or whatever, I just want to be very healthy. Everyone wants the same ten basic things: you want to avoid cancer, various things, you want to age slower. Now the AI has my goals, and a little thing pops up and says &#8220;Beep beep, in 15 minutes you&#8217;re going to eat.&#8221; Cuz it knows that&#8217;s the right time for my body to eat. 15 minutes later, a little slot opens in my wall where a drone has come from the food factory and dropped the perfect meal for that moment for me: for my mood, for my genome, for my blood contents. Because it knows my goals &#8211; so you know it knows I want to feel energy at this time, or I want to wind down here &#8211; it knows you way better than you know yourself, better than any human could ever know you. You still have some choice &#8211; a little thing pops up and says, &#8220;Coffee?&#8221; because it knows that I can have coffee for the next 15 minutes only because at that point, it knows how long it stays in my system, it knows what my sleep is like when I have it too late, it knows I have to wake up at this time tomorrow because it knows my calendar.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>So this is something I think humans are wrong about. Most people will hear this and think, &#8220;That sounds awful! It sounds dystopian!&#8221; No it doesn&#8217;t! It sounds incredible, and if we all had this, we would not look back and be like, &#8220;I wish I was making awful choices every day like I was in the past.&#8221; And these aren&#8217;t important decisions. Your important attention and focus can go on to your kids, and work, and helping any other people&#8230; things that matter.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>I think we&#8217;ll all be so much healthier.

That might sound bad, but when it&#8217;s activated at your own body, less is better. In return, you&#8217;ll have <strong>more energy throughout the day and a better mood</strong>, since inflammatory signals increase anxiety.</em></p><p><em>But, if your issues are primarily <strong>driven by how sensitive your brain is to fuel availability or stress hormone levels</strong>, then <strong>skipping breakfast can be a bad thing</strong>. If you haven&#8217;t eaten, then you will have <strong>less fuel in your blood stream</strong> for your brain, and this <strong>happens right when your stress hormone levels are naturally elevated</strong>, since you get a <strong>natural pulse of cortisol in the morning</strong> when you wake up. Cortisol makes it more difficult for the brain cells in your prefrontal cortex, the higher thinking part of your brain, to bring fuel in, so <strong>low fuel + high cortisol can really affect your ability to focus, analyze, control your emotions, and generally do the things that you want from your brain</strong>. If you get <strong>hangry</strong>, then this will further <strong>raise your cortisol</strong> and exacerbate the cycle, so <strong>eating can be very helpful </strong>to make sure your brain doesn&#8217;t run out of steam later in the day.</em></p><p><em>But it doesn&#8217;t stop there. <strong>What if you have both challenges, which isn&#8217;t that uncommon?</strong> Then you may feel better stopping or starting breakfast, but be stuck in a local optimum, or you&#8217;ll feel better in some ways, but worse in others. Then, <strong>we need to solve one or both challenges</strong> - e.g. support healthy levels of inflammation - so you can eat breakfast to support your brain, or vice versa.</em></p><p><em>So back to your case. When we looked at your labs, your wearable data, and your interview data, <strong>it looked like you had both high inflammation and sensitivity to stress hormones, so we experimented</strong>&#8230; We tested what happened when we supported you via supplements to keep your inflammatory levels in the optimal range and then <strong>added breakfast to support your brain, and voila, much more energy and focus when you wanted it</strong>!</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Flow: The Normie Blockchain ]]></title><description><![CDATA[Zigging When Others Zag and Progressively Decentralizing to Win the Future]]></description><link>https://www.notboring.co/p/flow-the-normie-blockchain</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.notboring.co/p/flow-the-normie-blockchain</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Packy McCormick]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 13:52:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55181ac7-1e7a-40e0-89ec-7b1dbca955e4_1200x600.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Welcome to the&nbsp;<strong>841&nbsp;newly Not Boring people&nbsp;</strong>who have joined us since last Monday!

I think that&#8217;s what we have today.&nbsp;</p><p>Many people in crypto dismiss Flow, the blockchain originally developed by Dapper Labs, as too centralized or corporate. While it started that way, what&#8217;s happened since and beneath the surface is much more complex and fascinating. They&#8217;re building a maximally decentralized platform to support a billion users building complex worlds on-chain, even if it means making some hard trade-offs upfront.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a Sponsored Deep Dive on Flow. As with Solana and Braintrust, I figured that the interest in Flow is broad enough that it deserved to be a Monday piece. While the piece is sponsored, these are all my real and genuine views &#8211; there&#8217;s no perfect blockchain; it&#8217;s all about making the right trade-offs to serve the target audience and use cases.&nbsp;The future is multi-chain. </p><p>Plus, if I weren&#8217;t genuinely fascinated, there&#8217;s no way that I could have written 14,000+ words &#8211; they would have paid me for less than half that many! You can read about how I choose and write Sponsored Deep Dives <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K24dAK5k7LHuYMsJMyd2acDSqw8bEdJm_pciVrmVNXA">here</a>.</p><p><em><strong>Disclaimer</strong>:</em> <em>As always, this is <strong>not investment advice.</strong> I own a small amount of FLOW.

In <em><a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/the-dao-of-daos">The DAO of DAOs</a>, </em>for example, I wrote, &#8220;I think that stakeholder ownership is the natural state of things, and that we just haven&#8217;t had the technology or models to coordinate such widely distributed governance and ownership before.&#8221; I was proud of myself for coming up with the comparison.&nbsp;</p><p>Turns out, I was years behind <a href="https://twitter.com/roham">Roham Gharegozlou</a>. In December 2018, the <a href="https://www.dapperlabs.com/">Dapper Labs</a> CEO gave a TED Talk titled <em>Life is Non-Fungible: The Evolution of Ownership, Assets, and Us:&nbsp;</em></p><div id="youtube2-u894J50AqOs" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;u894J50AqOs&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u894J50AqOs?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>In it, he walked through the history of ownership, collectibles, and money to highlight NFTs&#8217; place in the grand arc of human history. He even used Legos to describe composability long before that became the default analogy. Concluding the talk, he said:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>Blockchain is creating a world of <strong>digital assets and open source software</strong> that is <strong>real and permanent as anything physical</strong> and <strong>built to interoperate like Lego sets</strong>. Now don&#8217;t get me wrong, the <strong>barriers to adoption are incredibly high</strong>. <strong>Speed, scalability, user experience, and cost will have to change dramatically before any of you will consider using these tools in your daily life</strong>. But if you squint, something absolutely incredible is starting to happen.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>For the first time, we have both the reason and the ability to <strong>tear down the feudal castles that control our online experiences</strong>. For the first time, we can transition to true digital freedom, where <strong>identity, self-expression, and ownership is back where it belongs: in your hands.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>It was prescient. Roham gave the speech two full years before 99.99% of us had ever heard the term &#8220;NFT.&#8221; Since then many others have used the concepts Roham laid out in it to explain this wild new world approachably.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, the company Roham co-founded, Dapper Labs, and the blockchain it created, <a href="https://www.onflow.org/">Flow</a>, wants to give entire digital worlds physical properties with digital superpowers. Flow describes itself as the &#8220;blockchain for open worlds.&#8221; It has at its disposal the lego blocks of crypto, DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs.&nbsp;</p><p>Roham and the Flow team understand that open worlds, like the physical one, thrive with more participants from all walks of life, skill sets, and ability levels. Their job is to make it as easy as possible for anyone with an idea to build it and remix it with others&#8217;. They know that what makes physical cities and spaces vibrant aren&#8217;t the spaces themselves, but the people in them.&nbsp;</p><p>Nerds built the internet, but normies brought it to life by filling common spaces like AIM chat rooms, Facebook, and Twitter. Both are needed for a thriving digital ecosystem. But as Roham pointed out in the talk, the barriers to adoption for normies are high. Speed, scalability, user experience, and cost will have to improve dramatically before normies start participating in their daily life.&nbsp;</p><p>The stakes are high, too. We spend more and more time in digital worlds, playing the Great Online Game, in 2D worlds like Twitter to fully immersive video games. We both use and shape our digital worlds. The question is whether we&#8217;ll get the same property and voting rights in our digital worlds that we do in our physical ones. If we get it right, we&#8217;ll get the benefits of physical properties with <strong>digital superpowers</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>That&#8217;s what Roham and the team set out to do with <strong>Flow</strong>. It&#8217;s a blockchain built for open worlds, but really, it&#8217;s a blockchain built to onboard hundreds of millions or billions of mainstream consumers. <strong>Normies</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>As it stands, though, Flow is a dark horse in the crypto community. After a scorching Spring of 2021, Flow usage dipped.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc85f4fc-5fe8-43d0-99aa-42c25f3b6f65_1016x490.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc85f4fc-5fe8-43d0-99aa-42c25f3b6f65_1016x490.png" width="1016" height="490" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bc85f4fc-5fe8-43d0-99aa-42c25f3b6f65_1016x490.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:490,&quot;width&quot;:1016,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc85f4fc-5fe8-43d0-99aa-42c25f3b6f65_1016x490.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc85f4fc-5fe8-43d0-99aa-42c25f3b6f65_1016x490.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc85f4fc-5fe8-43d0-99aa-42c25f3b6f65_1016x490.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc85f4fc-5fe8-43d0-99aa-42c25f3b6f65_1016x490.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em><a href="https://flowscan.org/metrics/transactions?interval=Monthly">Flowscan</a></em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Transactions peaked at 8.1 million in April 2021.

In the first piece I ever wrote about the space, <em><a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/the-value-chain-of-the-open-metaverse?utm_source=url">The Value Chain of the Open Metaverse</a>,</em> I wrote about CryptoKitties and Top Shot. NFTs were the first web3 use case that really clicked for me beyond token speculation. They were my a-ha moment. As more of our lives became digital, I realized, <em>of course </em>we&#8217;d want a way to own our digital things.&nbsp;</p><p>Ownership of unique digital assets was made possible by the <strong>ERC-721 token standard</strong>. Tokens like ETH and BTC are <strong>fungible</strong>: every ETH is worth as much as every other, and people don&#8217;t care which ones they own. On Ethereum, fungible tokens work off of the same standard: <strong>ERC-20</strong>. For something like CryptoKitties, though, each of which is unique, ERC-20 didn&#8217;t work. So the team behind CryptoKitties, Axiom Zen, created a new standard, <strong>ERC-721</strong>. If ERC-20 tokens represent digital money, ERC-721 tokens represent digital <strong>things</strong>. Turns out, there&#8217;s a big market for digital things.&nbsp;</p><p>The wild part is: <strong>CryptoKitties, ERC-721, and NBA Top Shot were all created by the same people, </strong>Roham and his team.&nbsp;</p><p>The team that today runs <strong>Dapper Labs</strong>, led by co-founders Roham (CEO), Dieter &#8220;Dete&#8221; Shirley (CTO), and Mikhael &#8220;Mik&#8221; Naayem (CBO), started working together at Vancouver-based startup studio Axiom Zen, where they created CryptoKitties on top of Ethereum. While there, Dete co-authored the <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721">ERC-721 Standard</a> and <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/dete73/status/1465401744888791040">introduced the term &#8220;NFT.&#8221;</a></strong>&nbsp;</p><p>When Ethereum couldn&#8217;t handle the volume that CrypoKitties drove, they decided to spin up a new company, Dapper Labs, <strong>create their own blockchain, <a href="https://www.onflow.org/">Flow</a></strong>, and build NBA Top Shot as its first app to show off its potential.</p><p>For the avoidance of confusion, since we&#8217;ll be talking about both a lot, Dapper Labs is the parent company of both Top Shot and of the Flow blockchain, but Flow is a distinct entity from Dapper. The relationship between Dapper and Flow is somewhat like the Ethereum Foundation and Ethereum or Solana Labs and Solana, except that Dapper Labs is a for-profit entity that also builds applications on top of Flow, like NBA Top Shot, NFL All Day, and UFC Strike. As we&#8217;ll discuss throughout the piece, Flow is becoming increasingly independent and distinct from Dapper over time.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba5f790a-e207-483a-97b0-85c02d685194_1417x588.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba5f790a-e207-483a-97b0-85c02d685194_1417x588.png" width="1417" height="588" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ba5f790a-e207-483a-97b0-85c02d685194_1417x588.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:588,&quot;width&quot;:1417,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba5f790a-e207-483a-97b0-85c02d685194_1417x588.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba5f790a-e207-483a-97b0-85c02d685194_1417x588.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba5f790a-e207-483a-97b0-85c02d685194_1417x588.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba5f790a-e207-483a-97b0-85c02d685194_1417x588.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>With CryptoKitties and Top Shot, Dapper built an incredible top of funnel machine for the entire space.

Sometimes, you need to <strong>make some bets on the future.</strong>&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So as you read through the piece, try to <strong>orient towards the future</strong>. As Layne described it:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>We designed Flow to exist over time. Blockchains will be the homes to <strong>digital cities</strong>, and Flow needs to make the same promises you&#8217;d want if you were building a city &#8211; giving people the ability to sustain themselves, making guarantees to builders, giving owners property rights, making sure no one can blow it up. Any city built today needs to respect the <strong>environment</strong>, and Flow is no different. It&#8217;s a sustainable way to own digital assets over time.</em></p><p><em>We want this to be a <strong>generational product</strong>, designed for ten years of dapps to seed ten more years of dapps.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>When you&#8217;re building on a decades-long time horizon, you make different decisions in the short-term. For example, while Flow&#8217;s transition to letting developers deploy to the blockchain permissionlessly has felt interminably long to some, a year and a half is very short in the grand scheme of things. The long time horizon is also why Flow has more prominent projects for kids and teenagers, like Cryptoys, Genies, and Brud, than other ecosystems.&nbsp;</p><p>In one of my favorite tech quotes of all time, Stripe&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickc">Patrick Collison</a> said:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>There&#8217;s something quite deep about the notion of using <strong>time horizons as a competitive advantage</strong>, in that you&#8217;re simply willing to wait longer than other people and you have an organization that is thusly oriented.</em></p></blockquote><p>After digging into Flow, I see the same ethos and patience at play. The Flow team is willing to trade time and short-term degen praise for a chance to get it right for billions of normies.&nbsp;</p><p>The strategy is sound and the trade-offs make sense, but until there are a billion users on Flow, questions remain. Some of the core questions for Flow are:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Can it prove that a large number of normie users prefer onboarding via consumer-grade blockchain applications over more web3-native-feeling ones?&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Can it attract so many of those users that developers take note and learn a new, non-EVM-compatible programming language to build apps on Flow?&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Will those developers build apps that keep users in the Flow ecosystem?&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Can Flow and the developers in its ecosystem provide the full web3 experience to those who want it over time?&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>All of which boil down to the big bet that Flow is making:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>By reversing the typical L1 approach &#8211; by building for normies first and progressively decentralizing &#8211; can Flow get the best of both worlds: real network effects and a solution to the Trilemma?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It&#8217;s not a guarantee that they&#8217;ll be able to make the transition &#8211; in fact, Flow looks like the cute underdog among blockchains &#8211; but there&#8217;s a lot of power hiding under the hood, and if anyone has the experience to onboard the next billion consumers, it&#8217;s the Dapper team.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Kitty Up!&nbsp;</strong></h3><p><a href="https://twitter.com/roham">Roham Gharegozlou</a> grew up on the internet. Born in Iran, his family moved him to Dubai when he was six, and then to Paris for high school. He found his permanent home online, where he made websites and ran side hustles. That experience helped get him into school in the States.</p><p>In 2012, three years after graduating from Stanford with a BA in Economics and a Masters in Biological Sciences, an oddly perfect combo for building online worlds, he launched <strong>Axiom Zen</strong>, &#8220;an award-winning venture studio that specializes in <strong>mainstream applications of new platforms</strong> and emerging technologies including blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI).&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>As early as 2014, Roham became intrigued with the potential of blockchains. Axiom Zen won grand prize at the Money 20/20 hackathon in Las Vegas that year. Two out of the company&#8217;s three submissions were bitcoin apps. OG.&nbsp;</p><p>An excellent <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/07/most-influential-2021-roham-gharegozlou/">profile in Coindesk</a>, written when the publication named Roham one of the 10 Most Influential people in crypto in 2021, described that he was initially attracted by the opportunity to <strong>remove platform risk for developers</strong>. By 2016, he had pulled in Axiom Zen&#8217;s Chief Software Architect, Dete, to figure out how to build something on Ethereum &#8220;to illustrate that with something concrete, something fun, something even goofy.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, Roham&#8217;s high school classmate from Paris, Mik Naayem, who had been on the Board of Axiom Zen since the company&#8217;s founding, sold his mobile game platform-as-a-service company to Animoca Brands. While Mik was taking some post-acquisition time off, Roham kept bugging him about this blockchain thing. Mik was in Brazil kitesurfing, but after a couple weeks of reading up post-sesh, it finally hit him: this technology has the power to give people <strong>ownership, rights, and freedom</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>(Case in point: as we speak, thousands of people from around the world are donating BTC and ETH to Ukraine: <a href="https://twitter.com/Ukraine/status/1497594592438497282?s=20&amp;t=wXAYvvi6YEUvCD33TsRCCg">learn more and donate here</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>He finally gave into Roham&#8217;s pleas to &#8220;get up here,&#8221; and headed up to Canada. When he got up there, the team was chewing on this prompt:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>We believe in a decentralized future, what bridges need to exist to get us there?</strong></p><p>First, they thought about creating a stablecoin. Only USDT existed at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, they explored building a privacy-securing blockchain using zero knowledge proofs.&nbsp;</p><p>None seemed the right one to help achieve the goal: <strong>to make the new technology tangible for everyday people.</strong></p><p>Finally, &#8220;&#8203;&#8203;One day, as they left yet another fruitless brainstorming meeting, [Dete] Shirley&#8217;s co-worker, Mack Flavelle, turned to him and said, &#8216;<strong>We need to put cats on the blockchain.</strong>&#8217;&#8221;</p><p>Once they figured out what that actually meant, the team got to work building. By the fall of 2017, they were ready. They unveiled CryptoKitties live at the ETHWaterloo hackathon.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1d95a69-f810-4427-9ec4-e8f8fb2ad6ed_808x688.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1d95a69-f810-4427-9ec4-e8f8fb2ad6ed_808x688.png" width="808" height="688" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b1d95a69-f810-4427-9ec4-e8f8fb2ad6ed_808x688.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:688,&quot;width&quot;:808,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1d95a69-f810-4427-9ec4-e8f8fb2ad6ed_808x688.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1d95a69-f810-4427-9ec4-e8f8fb2ad6ed_808x688.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1d95a69-f810-4427-9ec4-e8f8fb2ad6ed_808x688.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1d95a69-f810-4427-9ec4-e8f8fb2ad6ed_808x688.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>CryptoKitties at ETHWaterloo, October 2017</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>CryptoKitties won, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cats-invade-worlds-largest-ethereum-hackathon-651263323.html">alongside seven other teams</a>, including another Axiom Zen project, blockchain analytics tool Rufflet.

NFTs needed to represent things that people care about, they believed, and the internet fucking loves cats. They were right.&nbsp;</p><p>Consumers loved CryptoKitties, and it did give many of them a new way to interact with Ethereum. Too many. During its mainnet release a month after ETHWaterloo, the week of November 28, 2017, <strong>CryptoKitties broke the (decentralized) internet</strong>. Per <a href="https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/it-might-soon-be-flow-time/">Delphi Digital</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Pending transactions spiked from under 2,000 to over 11,000</strong>, and the CryptoKitties contract address <strong>accounted for almost 12% of all transactions</strong> on the network during this period.</em></p></blockquote><p>CryptoKitties got so big, so quickly that it no longer fit inside of Axiom Zen. Roham, Dete, Mik, and Mack decided to spin it out. In March 2018, <strong>they announced the independent CryptoKitties and a $12M funding round led by Chris Dixon at a16z and Fred Wilson at Union Square Ventures</strong>, both early investors in Coinbase.&nbsp;</p><p>When USV and a16z invested, they were investing in a digital collectibles company &#8211; more than just CryptoKitties, they knew, but not a whole blockchain. But that&#8217;s what they ended up getting.</p><p>According to CoinDesk, the month after the raise, April 2018, Roham started courting the NBA for a partnership. After making Ethereum unusable with some cat pictures, the team realized that NBA demand would be impossible to support.&nbsp;</p><p>So Dete&#8217;s tech team, including CryptoKitties OGs <a href="https://twitter.com/thekimcope">Kim Cope</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/laynelafrance">Layne Lafrance</a>, started looking for alternative blockchains. It was 2018, so luckily everyone was building one. They &#8220;read more than 100 white papers&#8221; and talked to 20 teams, but according to Dete, &#8220;No one was building a blockchain with an eye for creating <strong>high-quality, consumer-facing applications</strong>.&#8221;</p><p>Still, they promised Roham they wouldn&#8217;t need to build their own blockchain. And then, of course, they realized that they needed to build their own blockchain.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;We felt backed into having to build our own,&#8221; Dete told me:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>And once we did, we went whole hog. What else should we rethink? So we wrote our own <strong>new programming language</strong> (Cadence). We built a <strong>new interface between dapps and wallets</strong> that let users work with mobile, custodial, and browser wallets. We made a lot of decisions that were all about <strong>doing things at the protocol level that make it better for end-users who don&#8217;t want to spend time learning.&nbsp;</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>It was an expensive investment to make, but one that seemed worth it in the halcyon days of the late 2017 / early 2018 crypto craze.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69c060eb-7fef-49fc-a763-7422edfa8b47_975x405.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69c060eb-7fef-49fc-a763-7422edfa8b47_975x405.png" width="975" height="405" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/69c060eb-7fef-49fc-a763-7422edfa8b47_975x405.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:405,&quot;width&quot;:975,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69c060eb-7fef-49fc-a763-7422edfa8b47_975x405.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69c060eb-7fef-49fc-a763-7422edfa8b47_975x405.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69c060eb-7fef-49fc-a763-7422edfa8b47_975x405.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69c060eb-7fef-49fc-a763-7422edfa8b47_975x405.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>CoinMarketCap</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Then, things turned south quickly. They wouldn&#8217;t recover for a while.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kitty Down &#128574;</strong></p><p>One of the criticisms of Dapper Labs and Flow is that, unlike Ethereum or Bitcoin, it&#8217;s VC-backed. VCs get in early before normal people are able to get in, this argument goes, giving them practically free profits at the expense of whichever retail bag holder they dump on as soon as their lockup expires.&nbsp;</p><p>That&#8217;s fair in some cases but untrue in many others, as <a href="https://twitter.com/cobie">Cobie</a> <a href="https://cobie.substack.com/p/33?utm_source=url">lays out here</a>.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>There&#8217;s two ends of the spectrum on crypto VCs: the first are legitimate co-builders and crypto native long-term thinkers. They are the ones that<strong> keep building alongside their portfolio cos and kept builders alive through bear markets</strong>.</em></p></blockquote><p>In Dapper&#8217;s case, VCs kept the company alive during the bear market <em>and </em>the company sold tokens to the public at the same price it sold them to VCs, even though VCs invested first.&nbsp;</p><p>Chris at a16z was one of Dapper&#8217;s earliest backers, and has backed the company through every round, even when it seemed a little crazy. &#8220;Actually, check with the team on whether they&#8217;re OK talking about that.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;Oh yeah, we can talk about it.&#8221; Mik laughed.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;We went through some really bad times. In mid-2018, we were the CryptoKitties guys, the people who made cute little cat things, going around saying we were going to build a platform. People thought we were a one-trick pony. It was a huge challenge.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>In the months after formally launching Dapper Labs and raising $12 million, the market turned south and <strong>Crypto Winter</strong> began. In October, with <strong>Ethereum down 85%</strong> from January&#8217;s peak, and with CryptoKitties volume anemic, the team scratched together a $15 million Series A2 in October 2018, led by Venrock, with participation from Google Ventures as well as returning investors a16z and USV. <strong>Ethereum fell another 55%</strong> by the end of the year.&nbsp;</p><p>By 2019, it was getting comical. Most projects born in the ICO craze were long gone. The competition among new L1s was fierce, but they were fighting for scraps.

As part of the announcement, Roham also announced Dapper&#8217;s blockchain, <strong>Flow</strong>, to the world, and explained its differentiation:</p><blockquote><p><em>Bitcoin and Ethereum show how crypto can make the world of finance more open and transparent; <strong>Flow will do the same for consumers of entertainment and culture.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>The round was also the first that was convertible into FLOW tokens, which VCs bought for $0.10 per token. With the price sitting at $5.78, that looks like yet another steal for the VCs, but it was a very non-obvious bet at the time.</p><p>Let&#8217;s pause and take stock. At this point:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>CryptoKitties was hitting its two year anniversary and volume was anemic.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Dapper had raised $39 million.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Flow was announced but not live.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>There was no second hit app live.</p></li></ul><p>And then COVID hit.&nbsp;</p><p>Early on in COVID, before the spike in venture funding, there was a period during which the pandemic looked like a real threat to many startups&#8217; survival. Companies shut down offices, laid off employees, and hunkered down. At a16z, the team analyzed its portfolio and asked, &#8220;Who has cash and who doesn&#8217;t?&#8221; <strong>The biggest red flag in the portfolio was Dapper.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Mik told me how close it got: &#8220;There was a point at the beginning of the pandemic where we had <strong>six months of runway left</strong>. Then we were able to get another $10M round together.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>I asked Chris how he decided to invest again, and he told me honestly, &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t have done that if I didn&#8217;t run the fund. Dapper had raised something like $50 million and hadn&#8217;t found product-market fit. <strong>If I were a junior person, I don&#8217;t think I could have gotten the deal approved</strong>.&#8221;</p><p>But Chris did<em> </em>run the fund, and a16z, USV, and Dapper&#8217;s previous investors including Venrock, Accomplice, Animoca, and Samsung NEXT all backed the company again. By the time the round was <a href="https://decrypt.co/37754/nba-stars-12-million-investment-cryptokitties-dapper-labs">announced in August</a>, it had grown from $10 million to $12 million and finally to $13.4 million as new angels, like NBA stars like Andre Iguodala and Spencer Dinwiddie, and funds, including Coinbase Ventures and A.Capital, joined the round. This round, too, included <strong>tokens at $0.10.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; Mik recalled, &#8220;Things started to take off.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>The inflection point was the community sale. In September, Dapper sold up to $1,000 worth of FLOW tokens, or 10,000 FLOW, <a href="https://blog.coinlist.co/flow-raises-18m-on-coinlist/">via Coinlist</a> to as many people as wanted to buy. <strong>Each token was sold for $0.10, the same price VCs has paid over the prior two years.</strong> Over 12,500 users from 100 countries committed nearly $9 million in funds, breaking CoinList records for participation at the time. The next week, the company held an auction for another 25 million FLOW tokens, which cleared at $0.38 per token, raising an additional $9.5 million.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F012d7f38-c8f6-454b-8933-b72f15157edf_674x506.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F012d7f38-c8f6-454b-8933-b72f15157edf_674x506.png" width="674" height="506" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/012d7f38-c8f6-454b-8933-b72f15157edf_674x506.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:506,&quot;width&quot;:674,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F012d7f38-c8f6-454b-8933-b72f15157edf_674x506.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F012d7f38-c8f6-454b-8933-b72f15157edf_674x506.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F012d7f38-c8f6-454b-8933-b72f15157edf_674x506.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F012d7f38-c8f6-454b-8933-b72f15157edf_674x506.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Coinlist</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>When the FLOW token launched in October 2020, a16z, which owned more than any VC, only owned 3.2% of the network.

As you might recall from earlier, September marked a low-point in transactions on Flow. The Dapper team had proven that they could once again catch lightning in a bottle and build a blockchain-based product that consumers loved, but at that price, the investment was a bet that Dapper could keep attracting consumers with upcoming projects like NFL All Day, UFC Strike, and La Liga, and more importantly, that it could <strong>attract developers</strong> who want to reach mass market consumers with its blockchain.&nbsp;</p><p>Because while CryptoKitties tanked Ethereum, Flow handled Top Shot just fine. It was designed from the ground up for exactly that kind of usage; in a sense, Top Shot was built as a very successful beta test. What&#8217;s going on under the hood is a lot more fascinating.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Architecting Flow&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>The most important thing to understand about the Flow blockchain is that it was designed for what mainstream consumers want &#8211; <strong>high speeds and low costs</strong> &#8211; <strong>without sacrificing security or &#8211; in the long run &#8211; decentralization</strong>. To do that, Flow&#8217;s architects designed a <strong>multi-node architecture</strong> that <strong>separates consensus</strong> and <strong>compute</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Top Shot has run on Flow for its entire run without hiccups despite enormous volume. Per CryptoSlam, Flow has handled more than 2x more NFT transactions (17 million) than any other blockchain, most of which came from Top Shot.&nbsp;</p><p>But Flow is designed to handle many multiples more transactions from a variety of dapps &#8211; not just NFTs, but DAOs and DeFi; not just Dapper-developed, but developed by a growing number of independent developers. To attract them, it&#8217;s bringing both large numbers of consumers and a better developer experience, starting with its <strong>own programming language, Cadence.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>All of the choices the Flow team has made <strong>increase complexity upfront in order for a better experience in the future</strong>. That&#8217;s why Flow has felt more centralized to start. That&#8217;s not the end-state.&nbsp;</p><p>So in this section, we&#8217;ll dig into the three main areas of the <strong><a href="https://www.onflow.org/primer#primer-consumer">Flow Primer</a>:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Flow: Multi-Node Architecture</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Cadence: Developer-First Experience</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Consumers: Consumer-Friendly Onboarding</strong></p></li></ul><p>Ok, let&#8217;s go.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Flow: Multi-Node Architecture</strong></h4><p><strong>Flow is a blockchain for toys,&nbsp; but it&#8217;s not a toy blockchain</strong>. It clicked for me when I heard this podcast between Dete and Solana&#8217;s founder, Anatoly Yakovenko, who I described in my Solana piece as &#8220;a hardcore engineer&#8221; and &#8220;grizzled.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><iframe class="spotify-wrap podcast" data-attrs="{&quot;image&quot;:&quot;https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6765630000ba8aecee7636505ea1c74be6ed03&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Dieter Shirley - CTO of Dapper Labs, Lead Architect of Flow Ep #23&quot;,&quot;subtitle&quot;:&quot;By Anatoly Yakovenko&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Podcast episode&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.spotify.com/episode/6E9hB0yYGn5ubq7U1p08CV&quot;}" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/6E9hB0yYGn5ubq7U1p08CV" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe><p>Listen to that nerd joy! That&#8217;s a conversation between two people who&#8217;ve both been wrestling with the same challenges and have come up with more advanced solutions than nearly anyone in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>But Solana&#8217;s go-to-market involved teaming up with SBF and building for hardcore traders, while Flow&#8217;s involved cats, dunks, and credit cards. That&#8217;s obscured a lot of the technical magic happening under the hood. Which brings us back to the <strong>Scalability Trilemma</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Every new L1 is essentially an attempt to solve the Scalability Trilemma in a new and better way, either by eliminating the need for trade-offs or by enhancing the blockchain&#8217;s strength in one of the three legs: <strong>scalability, decentralization, and security</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>In the <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/04/07/sharding.html">essay</a> in which he coined the term, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wrote, &#8220;The scalability trilemma says that there are three properties that a blockchain try to have (scalability, security, and decentralization), and that, <strong>if you stick to &#8216;simple&#8217; techniques, you can only get two of those three</strong>.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>The essay was titled <em><a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/04/07/sharding.html">Why Sharding is Great</a></em>, a not-so-subtle hint at the non-simple approach he favors to solving the Trilemma: <strong>sharding</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>The Flow team, like the Solana team, believes that <strong>sharding fails in a few ways</strong>, the most important of which is that sharding breaks &#8220;ACID&#8221; guarantees, and therefore <strong>composability</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Essentially, sharding would mean pushing more complexity onto both application developers and users:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>A simple user action (purchasing a hat for a CryptoKitty using a stablecoin like TUSD) can take <strong>twelve transactions and seven blocks on a sharded blockchain</strong>. In an unsharded, ACID-compliant environment like Flow, the same action, and many more complex than it, can be handled by <strong>one atomic transaction in a single block</strong>.</em></p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F031aa4b8-c455-41cc-a3c0-27aa3801405e_908x728.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F031aa4b8-c455-41cc-a3c0-27aa3801405e_908x728.png" width="908" height="728" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/031aa4b8-c455-41cc-a3c0-27aa3801405e_908x728.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:728,&quot;width&quot;:908,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F031aa4b8-c455-41cc-a3c0-27aa3801405e_908x728.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F031aa4b8-c455-41cc-a3c0-27aa3801405e_908x728.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F031aa4b8-c455-41cc-a3c0-27aa3801405e_908x728.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F031aa4b8-c455-41cc-a3c0-27aa3801405e_908x728.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>KittyHats</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>As developers of the first NFT app that required composability, Flow&#8217;s team was uniquely positioned to understand the challenges with Ethereum from the application developer&#8217;s perspective. Plus, in addition to writing the first NFT standard and breaking the network with CryptoKitties, they also built the <strong>first consumer smart contract wallet on Ethereum</strong>, which had many of the features they&#8217;d ultimately build directly into Flow.&nbsp;</p><p>Reconstituted as Dapper Labs, the team wanted to partner with top IP holders, like the NBA and NFL, to create NFT projects and blockchain-based games, but they knew two things:</p><ol><li><p>If they brought in the kind of demand they expected from the IP holders&#8217; huge audiences, they <strong>would make Ethereum unusable</strong>, for themselves and others.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>To bring more developers and creators to NFTs and open worlds, they would need to find a blockchain that was <strong>faster, cheaper, and easier to build consumer experiences on</strong>.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>They had no intention of building their own blockchain; they just couldn&#8217;t find one in the sea of options that was built the way they would have built it. So they decided to build it themselves, and <strong>Flow was born</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>The Flow team&#8217;s core insight was that they could <strong>split consensus and compute</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>In plain English, there are two types of blockchain tasks: <strong>non-deterministic and deterministic</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Consensus</strong>, agreeing on which block of transactions comes next, is non-deterministic or subjective.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Compute</strong>, computing the result of transactions, is deterministic or objective.&nbsp;</p><p>Compute is more computationally expensive but less of a security risk; it&#8217;s easy to prove if someone is lying about the result of 2+2. Consensus is computationally cheaper but more of a security risk. Flow&#8217;s architects realized that a more efficient architecture splits the two:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Compute</strong>: fewer, more expensive computers running nodes.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Consensus: </strong>more, cheaper computers running nodes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Existing blockchains made each node do both, limiting either throughput or security. Flow set out to achieve the best of both worlds.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;As a consensus node,&#8221; Dixon explained,&nbsp; &#8220;All you need to know is that state transitions are valid, you don&#8217;t need to compute them. It&#8217;s similar to the insight made by zk rollups.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>In the technical paper, <em><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05821.pdf">Flow: Separating Consensus and Compute</a>, </em>published in September 2019,<em> </em>Dete, Lafrance, and Dr. Alexander Hentschel laid out the case for their new architecture.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>The focus of this paper is to formalize the split of consensus and computation, and prove that this <strong>approach increases throughput without compromising security</strong>. In contrast to most existing proposals, our <strong>approach achieves scaling via separation of concerns</strong>, i.e., better utilization of network resources, rather than sharding.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>In February 2020, the Flow team put out a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.07403.pdf">second technical paper</a> more fully fleshing out the multi-node architecture, this time with four node types:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Consensus Nodes</strong> decide the order of transactions on the blockchain</p></li><li><p><strong>Verification Nodes</strong> are responsible for keeping the Execution Nodes in check</p></li><li><p><strong>Execution Nodes</strong> perform the computation associated with each transaction</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Collection Nodes</strong> commit to the presence of transactions and enhance network connectivity and data availability for dapps</p></li></ul><p><strong>Splitting validation among four nodes was and remains a key innovation for Flow. No other chain uses this architecture.</strong></p><p>This diagram shows the how the four nodes work together to validate a transaction in a pipeline, each node doing specialized work and passing the result on to the next:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f5417b3-e516-40ca-a9b2-f632045af753_589x275.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f5417b3-e516-40ca-a9b2-f632045af753_589x275.png" width="589" height="275" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7f5417b3-e516-40ca-a9b2-f632045af753_589x275.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:275,&quot;width&quot;:589,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f5417b3-e516-40ca-a9b2-f632045af753_589x275.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f5417b3-e516-40ca-a9b2-f632045af753_589x275.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f5417b3-e516-40ca-a9b2-f632045af753_589x275.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f5417b3-e516-40ca-a9b2-f632045af753_589x275.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Separating Consensus and Compute, Block Formation and Execution</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>My first question when I was reading through all of this was, &#8220;What happens if the Consensus nodes verify a transaction that ends up being invalidated by the Execution or Verification nodes?&#8221;

Many L1s and L2s are &#8220;EVM-compatible,&#8221; meaning in part that their smart contracts are written in Solidity and can plug into the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).&nbsp;</p><p>With its own language and architecture, Flow isn&#8217;t EVM-compatible. It forces developers to choose and to learn. It&#8217;s a risky bet: even if it works, the third-party ecosystem will take longer to develop. There&#8217;s not a whole world of open source resources for Cadence, or a network of auditors to audit smart contract code. Cadence is another reason that Flow needed to start out more centralized.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, Cryptoys CTO Emilio Cueto told me that the learning curve from Solidity to Cadence is easy, and that the differences are minor from a coding perspective but all come out in Cadence&#8217;s favor from a builder&#8217;s perspective.&nbsp;</p><p>Obie Fernandez, the CEO and founder of Let the Music Pay, which created Flow-based music NFT platform <a href="https://app.rcrdshp.com/">RCRDSHP</a>, is a Cadence fan, too:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>We&#8217;ve tried a few and <strong>Cadence is the most developer-friendly blockchain programming language</strong> in our experience. We love the familiar syntax and how productive it is, especially compared to Solidity.</em></p></blockquote><p>That&#8217;s a strong endorsement. Prior to founding RCRDSHP, Fernandez was the CTO at Andela and wrote the bible for Ruby on Rails development, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rails-Way-Obie-Fernandez/dp/0321445619">The Rails Way</a>.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>The magic of Cadence is that it&#8217;s a <strong>programming language specifically designed for digital ownership</strong>.</p><p>According to the Primer, &#8220;<a href="https://github.com/onflow/cadence">Cadence</a> is the first ergonomic, <strong>resource-oriented</strong> smart contract programming language.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike other programming languages, which predate &#8220;programmable money,&#8221; Cadence essentially <strong>makes money its own data type</strong>, which means the language can do different things with money than it does with normal numbers or strings of text. Unlike a string of text, for example, money can&#8217;t just be copied in Cadence. That means developers can secure users&#8217; assets more easily, too.</p><p>This is an idea whose time has come. Independently, the world-class team working on Libra for Facebook created the resource-oriented <strong>Move</strong> programming language in a similar way.</p><p>Flow offers a few additional key upgrades to the dapp developer experience:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Ergonomic syntax</strong> makes it easy to read and, importantly, to audit.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Flow-created <strong>open source library</strong> of SDKs and Standards (like the FT and NFT standards, Flow equivalents of ERC-20 and ERC-721).&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Strong, static type system</strong> helps catch errors when the code is compiled as opposed to when it&#8217;s being run in the wild.</p></li><li><p><strong>Upgradeable smart contracts</strong> allow developers to release labeled beta versions to mainnet in order to find and fix bugs before fully releasing control of the contract.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Flow Client Library </strong>makes it easy for any application to work with any wallet and vice versa, without custom code on either side.</p></li></ul><p>Additionally, Flow&#8217;s minimal environmental impact &#8211; a transaction on Flow takes less energy than a Google search &#8211; appeals to both developers, and to their customers and partners.&nbsp;</p><p>The upshot is that Cadence and other developer-facing decisions that Flow makes, make users more secure, and it might be easier for <em>new</em> developers to learn, but it comes with that familiar trade-off: <strong>complexity and time</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>First, Dapper only let developers launch on Flow if Dapper audited the smart contracts. Now, developers can build for Flow as long as they have an audit from a reputable auditor, which Flow will pay for, and more than 50 teams have independent keys to deploy freely. By summer, Flow expects to have <strong>fully permissionless deployment</strong>. This will be a key milestone to watch.&nbsp;</p><p>A lack of permissionless deployment to date has turned many in the developer community off, but Dete explained the logic: &#8220;We have to be protective of the network today because it is so complex.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>He pointed out that there were bugs in early Ethereum deployments, but that it didn&#8217;t matter because usage was so low. The stakes are higher for any blockchain now. So Flow made a conscious and temporary decision to make sure that everything is just right and ready for prime time.&nbsp;</p><p>It makes the same trade-offs when facing consumers.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Consumers: Consumer-Friendly Onboarding</strong></h4><p>Flow was designed at the protocol level to make it easier for developers to make the experience easy and safe for consumers.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, Flow touts <strong>Human Readable Security</strong>, which means that it&#8217;s easier for wallets to tell users what they&#8217;re allowing when they sign a transaction in plain English.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbcc696f8-b56e-4434-9c6f-201318a4cc75_1298x698.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbcc696f8-b56e-4434-9c6f-201318a4cc75_1298x698.png" width="1298" height="698" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bcc696f8-b56e-4434-9c6f-201318a4cc75_1298x698.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:698,&quot;width&quot;:1298,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbcc696f8-b56e-4434-9c6f-201318a4cc75_1298x698.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbcc696f8-b56e-4434-9c6f-201318a4cc75_1298x698.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbcc696f8-b56e-4434-9c6f-201318a4cc75_1298x698.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbcc696f8-b56e-4434-9c6f-201318a4cc75_1298x698.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Human Readable Login Flow On Matrix World via Blocto</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>When I signed in to <a href="https://matrixworld.org/home">Matrix World</a> with my Blocto wallet, the approval screens described what was I was approving &#8211; &#8220;You are signing for Transaction Fee - Free (subsidized by Blocto)&#8221; &#8211; and let me know that there was a script being run so that I could check it if I wanted.

It seems like table stakes for normie adoption. To use a historical analogy, apps took off after Apple made it safe to download them without worrying about viruses. With money on the line, the stakes are even higher in web3.&nbsp;</p><p>Equally important to normie onboarding, Flow lets users sign up for accounts <strong>without needing to store or remember 12 or 24 word seed phrases</strong>. It feels much more like a normal consumer web onboarding than other wallets. Then, they can evolve into something more advanced.</p><p>&#8220;Top Shot was originally built with a custodial wallet integrated with a private interface,&#8221; Dete explained, &#8220;Our new products like NFL All Day and UFC Strike use FCL, which is an open interface, and Top Shot now lets people withdraw to non-custodial wallets as well. But we believe that <strong>you don&#8217;t need to always start by asking people to set up a non-custodial wallet to participate.</strong>&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, Flow wants to give users choice.&nbsp;</p><p>Some users will always want to pay with a credit card and have the wallet provider hold their NFT or tokens on their behalf.&nbsp;</p><p>Others will want to login, pay, and store NFTs and tokens with a non-custodial wallet like <a href="https://blocto.portto.io/en/">Blocto</a>, the most popular on Flow not built by Dapper.</p><p>Many, Flow believes, will want to start with a custodial wallet and more centralized experience, and then transition to self-custody over time as they get more comfortable. Some of <em>those </em>will then want to bridge assets over to other chains via bridges and wormholes.&nbsp;</p><p>Flow wants to support all of those use cases by meeting consumers where they are and then growing with them. Essentially, Flow has progressively decentralized itself and its users.</p><h3><strong>Progressive Decentralization</strong></h3><p>We&#8217;ve covered a lot, so I want to pause to give you a quick framework to use to think about Flow.&nbsp;</p><p>One of my favorite pieces in the web3 canon is Jesse Walden&#8217;s <em><a href="https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/">Progressive Decentralization: A Playbook for Building Crypto Applications</a>. </em>In it, he describes the three components required to have a successful blockchain-based application:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p>Product-Market Fit&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Community Participation&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Community Ownership</p></li></ol><p>This table is a handy quick-reference guide:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dcc3b38-ea11-4c75-baf9-2b2c34acf391_908x748.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dcc3b38-ea11-4c75-baf9-2b2c34acf391_908x748.png" width="908" height="748" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7dcc3b38-ea11-4c75-baf9-2b2c34acf391_908x748.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:748,&quot;width&quot;:908,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dcc3b38-ea11-4c75-baf9-2b2c34acf391_908x748.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dcc3b38-ea11-4c75-baf9-2b2c34acf391_908x748.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dcc3b38-ea11-4c75-baf9-2b2c34acf391_908x748.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dcc3b38-ea11-4c75-baf9-2b2c34acf391_908x748.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Progressive Decentralization Playbook, Jesse Waldden</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>The progressive decentralization playbook is typically applied at the application layer, to dapps that become DAOs.

NFTs were just the first instantiation. Those use cases need more legos.&nbsp;</p><p>So now there&#8217;s <strong>DeFi</strong> on Flow. <a href="https://flowty.io/">Flowty</a>, a P2P NFT lending marketplace, launched in early February and has done over $300k in loan volume over 65 loans. The largest transaction to date was a $50k loan against a LeBron James Cosmic Top Shot Moment. This too is progressively decentralizing, starting by exclusively supporting high-value NBA Top Shot legendary tier assets and expanding to more Flow-based collections over time. Other DeFi projects, including decentralized exchanges, are coming, too. They&#8217;ll mostly be focused not on the degens, but on helping build the financial backbones for NFTs, games, and open worlds.&nbsp;</p><p>For normies, DeFi might not be the right on-ramp into web3, but by starting with NFTs and progressing to DeFi, the Flow ecosystem can introduce them to the benefits of the on-chain financial system. One step at a time.&nbsp;</p><p>The <strong>DAOs</strong> are coming, too, via Dapper Collectives, starting with Brud. Dapper&#8217;s October acquisition of the company behind Lil Miquela brought with it both Flow&#8217;s first DAO <em>and</em> a web3-native entrepreneur behind one of Ethereum&#8217;s most successful.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Acquiring and Decentralizing Brud</strong></h3><p>Given the threads of progressive decentralization and complex communities that run through Dapper&#8217;s story, it shouldn&#8217;t be surprising that its entry into DAOs was the result of a founder&#8217;s thwarted desire to progressively decentralize.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/whatdotcd">Trevor McFedries</a> founded Brud in 2016 to create new models for digital storytelling using &#8220;community-owned media and collectively built worlds,&#8221; exactly the type of use case Flow was purpose-built to handle.

For a few years, he&#8217;d been bringing the idea of exiting-to-community up at board meetings but they were skeptical of crypto and uninterested. One of his board members told him that last time they did a token investment, they got deposed by the SEC.

He realized telling wasn&#8217;t working, so he decided to show. &#8220;<strong>Part of launching FWB was about showing my board how much value could accrue to DAOs.</strong>&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.fwb.help/">FWB</a> is Friends With Benefits, the cultural DAO that Trevor launched in September 2020. And he was right. One year later, in September 2021, FWB <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/10/27/investing-in-friends-with-benefits-a-dao/">raised $10 million from a16z</a>. Just as the Dapper team popularized NFTs, Trevor and FWB popularized non-DeFi DAOs.&nbsp;</p><p>FWB&#8217;s success, and the growing excitement around DAOs generally, finally convinced his board that decentralizing was a good idea, but many of them were blocked from holding tokens in their fund docs. So they asked Trevor to go find crypto investors to buy them out. He put together a deck and started having conversations, one of which was with Roham. Dapper and Roham are active investors in web3, but as the two started talking and connecting on the vision, he had a different idea:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>No one&#8217;s better at building experiences for the next generation than you, we both believe in a multi-chain future. <strong>Why not just build here?</strong> As you build tools for Brud&#8217;s community, you can just build them for everyone on Flow.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>The deal took a little while to close because Trevor wanted to make sure that Brud&#8217;s culture would fit inside of Dapper&#8217;s, but after rounds of conversations between the teams, he realized it was a snug fit. &#8220;We&#8217;re artsy emo kids; they&#8217;re super nice, smart Canadians.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In October, <a href="https://www.dapperlabs.com/newsroom/dapper-labs-acquires-brud">Dapper Labs officially acquired Brud</a> and announced the launch of <strong>Dapper Collectives</strong>, with Trevor as CEO. Dapper Collectives &#8203;&#8203;is &#8220;dedicated to paving the way for the decentralization of social media and the democratization of online common-interest communities on Flow, to ensure creator communities capture value.&#8221;</p><p>In <a href="https://avc.com/2021/10/dapper-collectives/">his own blog post</a>, USV&#8217;s Fred Wilson explained that Dapper Collectives initial efforts will include:</p><blockquote></blockquote><ul><li><p><em>Bring community ownership and collective building to Dapper Labs products &#8211;&#8211; starting with Lil Miquela and her 10 million fans;</em></p></li><li><p><em>Build and release open source tools to help other mainstream communities engage in decentralized ownership and governance on Flow blockchain;</em></p></li><li><p><em>Help the most forward-thinking &#8220;web 2&#8221; companies decentralize their operations, engaging at the CEO and Board of Directors level to assist in tokenomics as well as technical implementation.</em></p></li></ul><p>Roham called DAOs &#8220;the most interesting area after NFTs&#8221; in the quest to &#8220;put a crypto wallet in every pocket&#8221; through mainstream adoption.&nbsp;</p><p>For Trevor, it&#8217;s also an opportunity to rethink everything about DAOs and online communities:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>What are the <strong>voting mechanisms</strong> for people to make decisions?&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>How do you <strong>make everyone a creator</strong>?&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>What&#8217;s a more familiar front-end for a <strong>multi-sig wallet</strong>?&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>How can groups <strong>tell stories on-chain</strong> together by playing with time and provenance?&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Shouldn&#8217;t metaverses be <strong>character-driven</strong> instead of universe-driven?&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>On that last point, Trevor explained, &#8220;People don&#8217;t move to NYC for the architecture, even though it&#8217;s nice architecture. They move there for the people: to get laid, make money, have fun.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>And just like Top Shot didn&#8217;t mention crypto or NFTs &#8211; even though the Dapper team invented the phrase &#8211; Dapper Collectives has the opportunity to build a <strong>new vocabulary</strong> around online communities owned by members. Notice, for example, that they didn&#8217;t call it Dapper DAOs.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;<strong>Governance</strong> doesn&#8217;t make me want to get up and be active,&#8221; Trevor admitted, &#8220;And if you&#8217;re a 13-year-old kid, do you want to participate in <em>governance</em>? I don&#8217;t know&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>Like building a brand new blockchain and creating a new programming language, re-thinking everything that early DAO adopters understand means <strong>trading off speed of adoption and go-to-market</strong> upfront in exchange for what they believe will be a <strong>better solution for the long-term</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&#8220;Move slow and get it right.&#8221;</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The answer Trevor gave me when I asked when Brud will decentralize &#8211; in a familiar pattern, it will be the first DAO on Dapper Collectives when it does, before it opens up to partners and third-party groups &#8211; is how the Flow team approaches everything.&nbsp;</p><p>That&#8217;s because in a world in which everyone is always saying &#8220;We&#8217;re so early,&#8221; the Flow team believes we&#8217;re even earlier than everyone else does.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Young Users and Real Network Effects</strong></h3><p>One way to understand why Flow is running the strategy it&#8217;s running is this observation that Dete made about network effects:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>Before the iPhone, everyone thought that Palm had network effects, or that Blackberry had network effects. <strong>You don&#8217;t have real network effects until you get to huge scale</strong>.</em></p></blockquote><p>He points out that while everyone is obsessed with Ethereum&#8217;s network effects &#8211; most of the money being spent in web3 is being spent on Ethereum &#8211; &#8220;Dollars aren&#8217;t loyal. Liquidity is cheap. Users and developers are sticky.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>The Flow team&#8217;s stated goal is to become the <strong>first blockchain with a billion users</strong>. That would give it the scale to develop network effects <em>within a certain user group, </em><strong>mainstream consumers</strong>. Getting there requires differentiation and focus.&nbsp;</p><p>Dete doesn&#8217;t think that Flow will be the next great DEX (decentralized exchange) chain, and similarly, he doesn&#8217;t think that Ethereum should be a billion user chain. That&#8217;s not what it&#8217;s built for, and as described above, the Flow team has its concerns about sharding&#8217;s impact on the collaboration and composability needed to build real online worlds.</p><p>To get to a billion users, Flow is taking a two-pronged approach: <strong>now</strong> and <strong>future</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Now, </strong>it&#8217;s partnering with the NBA, NFL, La Liga, and other owners of popular IP &#8211; as well as mainstream-focused developers &#8211; to bring people into the Flow ecosystem and into web3 for the first time. &#8220;It&#8217;s not about stealing market share,&#8221; according to Dete, &#8220;It&#8217;s about building products that a billion people want to use.&#8221; Once those billion people come in the door, it&#8217;s up to Flow to keep them in the ecosystem and help them progressively become more comfortable with web3 tools.&nbsp;</p><p>I think Flow&#8217;s most important differentiator, though, and its secret weapon, is that it&#8217;s building for the <strong>future</strong>, in a couple of ways.</p><p>First, it built a blockchain and a programming language aimed at <strong>attracting web2 developers</strong> who are coming into web3 with fresh eyes and evaluating each ecosystem on its own merits. The team recognizes that it would be difficult to pull web3 developers away from their language and ecosystem of choice, but believes that new web2 refugees &#8211; people who will need to learn a new language anyway and are used to building experiences for hundreds of millions or billions of people &#8211; are most likely to find a home on Flow.</p><p>Second, and most importantly, Flow is the only blockchain focused on <strong>young users</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>One of my favorite strategies that a handful of special companies run is taking advantage of the <strong>Compounding Power of Young Users</strong>.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4123bc77-7c73-4f62-b5f9-d4acf4d6f03f_1579x942.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4123bc77-7c73-4f62-b5f9-d4acf4d6f03f_1579x942.png" width="1456" height="869" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4123bc77-7c73-4f62-b5f9-d4acf4d6f03f_1579x942.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:869,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4123bc77-7c73-4f62-b5f9-d4acf4d6f03f_1579x942.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4123bc77-7c73-4f62-b5f9-d4acf4d6f03f_1579x942.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4123bc77-7c73-4f62-b5f9-d4acf4d6f03f_1579x942.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4123bc77-7c73-4f62-b5f9-d4acf4d6f03f_1579x942.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The idea here is to focus on building the best experience possible for the youngest part of your market, acquiring and retaining them as they get older, and continuing to focus on serving the youngest people who age into your market. The hard part is that in the short-term, they don&#8217;t have the most money to spend and they&#8217;re not the most profitable segment, but if you retain them over the long-term, you own the future.&nbsp;</p><p>This is what <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/stripe-the-internets-most-undervalued-ec3?s=w">Stripe</a> did so well &#8211; recall Patrick Collison&#8217;s <strong>time horizons as a competitive advantage</strong> &#8211; it focused on the startups instead of going after the biggest companies, and then grew with those startups. It&#8217;s what <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/oh-snap-?s=w">Snap</a> did so well, too. For years, critics argued that Snap needed to make the product less confusing to older people with more money to spend, but Snap continued to focus on building the best experience for young users and came to dominate their use case for that segment.</p><p>And it&#8217;s exactly what Dapper is trying to pull off with Flow. The crypto money is on Ethereum, and by extension in EVM-compatible chains, but<strong> the next billion users might be somewhere else.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This idea struck me when I talked to Trevor. Having built Miquela for a teen audience and attracted 10 million fans, he knows the demographic well and takes them seriously. That came across in the way that he spoke about creating a new, more approachable vocabulary, and in the way he talked about building tools for Flow:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>We&#8217;re building safer legos. The tricky thing about Ethereum is that it&#8217;s easy to fuck it up, and fucking up can have real financial consequences.</em> <em><strong>Unlocking the next billion people requires 13-year-olds just hacking away and shipping</strong>. We can&#8217;t prohibit them from playing around because they&#8217;re scared or because they don&#8217;t have the money.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>DAOs today speak to Younger Millennials and Gen Z. Younger Gen Z is still skeptical. They can&#8217;t play around on Ethereum; <strong>their $20 allowance doesn&#8217;t cover gas</strong>. That feels like a white space.</em></p></blockquote><p>He wants to broaden the view of what it means to be a tech entrepreneur from the traditional 22-year-old Stanford CS grad to the creators and passionate fans.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>We want to give the 15-year-old sneaker flipper the tools to be able to say, &#8220;What if we did it this way instead?&#8221; We want to give YouTubers the tooling to build their own models. Really, <strong>we want to give people the tooling and design space to go fuck things up.&nbsp;</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>As an old myself, it&#8217;s hard to admit, but it&#8217;s true: t<strong>he next wave of massive consumer hits aren&#8217;t likely to be built by or for someone my age</strong>. Flow and its ecosystem are focused on who&#8217;s next.&nbsp;</p><p>While Trevor and the Dapper Collectives team are building tools for younger users, third-party entrepreneurs are building products, experiences, and worlds to onboard them into web3. The two examples of third-party dapps building on Flow that come up most often are both building for very young users: <strong>Genies</strong> and <strong>Cryptoys</strong>.</p><p>They give a good flavor for the kinds of projects enabled by Flow. Let&#8217;s look at each quickly.</p><h4><strong>Genies</strong></h4><p>My friend whose degen contact called Flow &#8220;normie blockchain,&#8221; followed up with another text: &#8220;Asking the NFT peeps I know who are basically saying they haven&#8217;t heard much about it in months. A project called <strong>Genies</strong> building on it. <strong>Genies seems cool</strong>.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/akashrnigam">Akash Nigam</a> and Evan Rosenbaum launched <a href="https://genies.com/">Genies</a> as a non-crypto avatar project in 2016 with a mission to &#8220;be the digital identity for humans.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0b8584f-b205-4f0b-a2c8-8508892a4ac2_1398x789.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0b8584f-b205-4f0b-a2c8-8508892a4ac2_1398x789.png" width="1398" height="789" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a0b8584f-b205-4f0b-a2c8-8508892a4ac2_1398x789.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:789,&quot;width&quot;:1398,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0b8584f-b205-4f0b-a2c8-8508892a4ac2_1398x789.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0b8584f-b205-4f0b-a2c8-8508892a4ac2_1398x789.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0b8584f-b205-4f0b-a2c8-8508892a4ac2_1398x789.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0b8584f-b205-4f0b-a2c8-8508892a4ac2_1398x789.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Genies via TechCrunch</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>For the first five years of its life, Genies has focused on letting users create their own personalized avatars that they can dress up to express their personality with clothes and accessories, including outfits from Gucci as part of a partnership. Users can use their avatars in apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, iMessage, and Giphy. The company has also partnered with celebrities including Justin Bieber, Cardi B, and Dapper Labs investor Shawn Mendes to create their avatars.&nbsp;</p><p>Last May, as NFTs heated up, Genies announced that it was building an NFT marketplace on Flow, and that it had raised a fresh $65 million from Bond&#8217;s legendary Mary Meeker.&nbsp;</p><p>I asked Akash how he came to build on Flow, and he told me it started with an Instagram outreach from Roham:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>I&#8217;d been talking about the philosophy behind NFTs &#8211; <strong>digital scarcity</strong> &#8211; for so long without knowing about NFTs. A couple years ago, I was talking about digital scarcity in an Instagram Story, and Roham saw it and reached out</em>. <em>He told me, &#8220;You&#8217;re talking about NFTs.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>The two got to talking, and Akash realized that NFTs were exactly what he was looking for. &#8220;I had a vision of authenticating digital assets, but I thought it was a 2025 thing, not a 2021 thing.&#8221; He looked around for the best places to build, and chose Flow for a few reasons:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Flow <strong>targets the youth</strong> instead of the existing web3 community</p></li><li><p>It was the <strong>easiest to build on</strong> coming from web2</p></li><li><p>It would allow users to <strong>compose NFTs</strong> and <strong>evolve their avatars</strong> over time, without complicated burn mechanisms</p></li></ul><p>Maybe most importantly, the two companies share similar missions. Akash said:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>We could do a $100 million NFT drop today, no problem, but that doesn&#8217;t do shit to move the world forward. <strong>What does matter is empowering kids with the knowledge of how all of this works and tools to create their own decentralized avatar ecosystems over time.</strong> So instead of thousands, we&#8217;re pricing things at $3, $4, $5, $7, $10.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>The average Genies user doesn&#8217;t look like the average web3 user. Akash told me the largest bucket of Genies users are 14-16-year-old girls. &#8220;They can get a lot out of NFTs, but you need to speak to them in a language they understand. Once you do, they can become builders.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>So Genies, too, started centralized and is slowly decentralizing. In January, it <a href="https://blog.genies.com/giving-you-ownership/index.html">announced</a> that it was expanding its mission: <strong>&#8220;empower humans to create their own digital identity ecosystems.&#8221; </strong>That starts with ownership &#8211; &#8220;Effective immediately, every single creator (talent and users alike) now owns their Genie&#8221; &#8211; and will expand over time to include the tools and materials to create virtual worlds and digital experiences, all owned by their creators, with full commercialization rights.&nbsp;</p><p>The Genies vision requires what Flow offers: scalability, accessibility, composability, and the decentralization needed to guarantee that its creators can&#8217;t get arbitrarily deplatformed. When you&#8217;re building a world, you need to know that the ground won&#8217;t disappear from under you.&nbsp;</p><p>Genies NFTs are scheduled to go live on Flow this summer.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Cryptoys</strong>&nbsp;</h4><p>Cryptoys is building for an even younger audience.&nbsp;</p><p>The company started as an idea for a digital-first toy company and evolved into something that looks more like an NFT-native Nintendo, with original IP, gaming, toys, and more.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2fc4e33c-b369-4b22-bf2e-de9cfd6d8fa8_1320x767.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2fc4e33c-b369-4b22-bf2e-de9cfd6d8fa8_1320x767.png" width="1320" height="767" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2fc4e33c-b369-4b22-bf2e-de9cfd6d8fa8_1320x767.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:767,&quot;width&quot;:1320,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2fc4e33c-b369-4b22-bf2e-de9cfd6d8fa8_1320x767.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2fc4e33c-b369-4b22-bf2e-de9cfd6d8fa8_1320x767.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2fc4e33c-b369-4b22-bf2e-de9cfd6d8fa8_1320x767.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2fc4e33c-b369-4b22-bf2e-de9cfd6d8fa8_1320x767.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Cryptoys</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>In October, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/25/a16z-leads-75m-funding-round-in-nft-toy-firm-onchain-studios/">a16z led a $7.5 million seed round</a> in Cryptoys&#8217; parent, OnChain Studios. Dapper Labs is also an investor.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/willweinraub">Will Weinraub</a>, Cryptoys&#8217; co-founder and CEO, told me that they started looking at Flow in the first place because they attribute the whole NFT bull run to Top Shot and Dapper Labs. &#8220;Top Shot didn&#8217;t mention NFTs; they just made it easy to get started, and then people could go down the rabbit hole and discover everything else.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>What Top Shot did for sports fans, Cryptoys wants to do for kids and gamers. &#8220;We want parents and grandparents to be able to buy <strong>Cryptoys for Christmas</strong>, and Flow makes the most sense from that standpoint.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>More specifically, Cryptoys chose to build on Flow for a few reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>First, the environmental impact is key. Cryptoys wants to partner with larger brands, and Flow&#8217;s <strong>minimal environmental impact</strong> is appealing to those brands. Gamers notoriously hate NFTs because of (often ill-informed) concerns about their environmental impact.</p><p>Second, Cryptoys&#8217; co-founder and CTO <a href="https://twitter.com/emiliorcueto">Emilio Cueto</a> explained, <strong>composability</strong> is necessary for Cryptoys. Each Cryptoy has a bunch of attribute layers representing things that the Cryptoy owns. &#8220;If you put a hat on a Panda,&#8221; he highlighted, &#8220;the Panda owns the hat. If you sell the Panda, the hat can go with it in one transaction.&#8221; It&#8217;s not just clothes, either. Each Cryptoy will have skills that stick with them, that can change, evolve, and be acquired over time.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b6631bb-f9f6-4a57-8163-c50b2f6e0342_908x393.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b6631bb-f9f6-4a57-8163-c50b2f6e0342_908x393.png" width="908" height="393" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4b6631bb-f9f6-4a57-8163-c50b2f6e0342_908x393.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:393,&quot;width&quot;:908,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b6631bb-f9f6-4a57-8163-c50b2f6e0342_908x393.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b6631bb-f9f6-4a57-8163-c50b2f6e0342_908x393.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b6631bb-f9f6-4a57-8163-c50b2f6e0342_908x393.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b6631bb-f9f6-4a57-8163-c50b2f6e0342_908x393.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em><a href="https://blockster.com/blockdesk/2255_cryptoys-the-new-amp-fun-crypto-platform-on-the-block-chain">Blockster</a></em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Composability as it works on Flow makes that easier than it is on other chains. One resource can own another resource, and because Cadence is resource-oriented, it makes it much easier to compose a bunch of different assets in the code. A similar outcome on Ethereum might involve burning a hat and a Panda and getting back a Panda with a hat, as opposed to just sticking the hat on the Panda.&nbsp;</p><p>I asked Will and Emilio point blank if they were worried about betting their company on a chain other than Ethereum or Solana, and they didn&#8217;t seem concerned. They said that it&#8217;s just a matter of <strong>time </strong>until Flow breaks out:</p><blockquote><p><em>Flow is up and coming, there&#8217;s so much adoption. The reason most people can&#8217;t see that yet is that Flow has attracted projects with <strong>more interactivity</strong>, and those projects naturally take <strong>longer to build</strong>.</em></p></blockquote><p>It&#8217;s the same refrain over and over again: more complexity upfront, better experiences and richer worlds over time.&nbsp;</p><p>Cryptoys is betting that it can onboard the youngest users into web3 without them even thinking about it. In fact, most of Cryptoys users will probably never call it web3 (until some of them start writing thinkpieces comparing web4 to web3); they&#8217;ll just come to expect, and build, digital projects with ownership, composability, and fun baked in.&nbsp;</p><p>That&#8217;s the bet that the Flow team is making more generally: that it can build a longer-lasting platform that can deliver better, richer consumer experiences at scale by adding complexity up front and giving it time. That approach obviously has risks.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Risks and Trade-Offs</strong></h3><p>I hope it&#8217;s clear at this point &#8211; both in the piece and in Not Boring&#8217;s history &#8211; that I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s one perfect blockchain, or that there will be one blockchain to rule them all. As I&#8217;ve said many times, I&#8217;m a <strong>Maximalist Minimalist</strong>.</p><p>I hope it&#8217;s also clear what I think Flow&#8217;s biggest risks are at this point. We&#8217;ve been talking about the trade-offs throughout the piece:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Complexity means a longer time to maximal decentralization</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Building for mainstream consumers requires different things than building for crypto-natives</strong></p></li></ul><p>After spending hours with the Flow team and people in the ecosystem, I&#8217;m convinced that they made these trade-offs with eyes wide open and that they&#8217;re very happy with where they are today. That said, the trade-offs still come with major risks.</p><p>First and foremost, in an industry so dominated by <strong>momentum and narrative</strong>, Flow has been quiet. Many people I talked to pointed to the fact that, early last year, it seemed like a neck-and-neck competition for second place between Solana and Flow, but that Solana has pulled away.</p><p>I don&#8217;t think a single person working on Flow even thought about Solana as a competitor &#8211; the two are trying to do very different things for very different audiences &#8211; but there&#8217;s no doubt that Solana has taken more mindshare in the community and has attracted more third-party developers. A big risk to Flow is that they can&#8217;t make it clear to people why what they&#8217;re doing is <strong>different</strong>. They want to change what it means to be &#8220;in crypto,&#8221; but that means stacking a whole &#8216;nother level of complexity and education on top of already hard challenges.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, whether fair or not, the narrative around Flow is that it&#8217;s more centralized and permissioned than other blockchains. We&#8217;ve discussed the reasons they&#8217;ve made those trade-offs at length, but to win over the more crypto-native builders, they&#8217;ll need to change that perception. That&#8217;s just going to take momentum and keeping timing promises to developers. In Nike&#8217;s words: Winning Takes Care of Everything.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1027ae83-5e2a-4094-ba97-7bbae5f969de_638x428.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1027ae83-5e2a-4094-ba97-7bbae5f969de_638x428.png" width="638" height="428" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1027ae83-5e2a-4094-ba97-7bbae5f969de_638x428.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:428,&quot;width&quot;:638,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1027ae83-5e2a-4094-ba97-7bbae5f969de_638x428.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1027ae83-5e2a-4094-ba97-7bbae5f969de_638x428.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1027ae83-5e2a-4094-ba97-7bbae5f969de_638x428.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1027ae83-5e2a-4094-ba97-7bbae5f969de_638x428.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Second, Flow needs to <strong>fix the funnel</strong>. It needs more ways to keep people engaged with the Flow ecosystem after they&#8217;ve onboarded via one of the projects building on top of it in order to build real network effects. That will, of course, mean continuing to grow the Flow ecosystem, but it will also mean creating bridges between different dapps and a glue to hold it all together. Typically, that job is done by the blockchain&#8217;s token.&nbsp;</p><p>In Flow&#8217;s case, it made the trade-off to let people use credit cards and price in USD in order to onboard consumers more easily, but I think that it needs to somehow increase the adoption and usage of the FLOW token in the ecosystem. FLOW derives value from developer usage and staking, but it can also be used as the fabric that connects an ecosystem of increasingly decentralized dapps. Pricing in FLOW might make it less likely that consumers sell, take their USD, and go play elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><p>It seems like good news is on the way on this front:&nbsp;</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/roham/status/1499221262316433412&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;We are working on full FLOW coin support within Dapper wallet &#8211;&#8211; just like you can hold your Dapper balance in dollars, you should be able to hold, earn, and spend seamlessly in FLOW, the native token of <span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@flow_blockchain</span>&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;roham&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;roham&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Thu Mar 03 03:12:57 +0000 2022&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:251,&quot;like_count&quot;:878,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null}"><a href="https://twitter.com/roham/status/1499221262316433412" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-user-avatar" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/twitter_name/w_36/roham.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @roham"><span class="tweet-author-name">roham </span><span class="tweet-author">@roham</span></div>We are working on full FLOW coin support within Dapper wallet &#8211;&#8211; just like you can hold your Dapper balance in dollars, you should be able to hold, earn, and spend seamlessly in FLOW, the native token of <span class="tweet-fake-link">@flow_blockchain</span></a><a href="https://twitter.com/roham/status/1499221262316433412" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-footer"><p class="tweet-date">March 3rd 2022</p><span class="retweets"><span class="rt-count">251</span> Retweets</span><span class="likes"><span class="like-count">878</span> Likes</span></div></a></div><p>Finally, Flow will need to play catchup on the <strong>ecosystem</strong> front. I genuinely believe that there are strong advantages in the way Flow was built and in how it progressively decentralized for entrepreneurs building complex interactive consumer experiences, but starting out more centralized and permissioned came at a cost.&nbsp;</p><p>On other blockchains, anyone can come in, build legos, and deploy them to mainnet, for better or worse. The &#8220;for better&#8221; is that, without much work from a central team, <a href="https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-2021-f37874efea6d">18,146 monthly active developers</a> can come in and build apps and improvements. Flow will get there when it goes fully permissionless this summer, but it needs to both hit that target and rejuvenate developer interest. Because while it&#8217;s using time as a competitive advantage, it&#8217;s undoubtedly in a <strong>race against time</strong> as well.</p><p>Throw enough money and a global network of enough smart people at almost any problem, and they&#8217;ll solve it over time. Other blockchains have been able to take advantage of that dynamic to make improvements at the app layer and L2. Flow has made a bet that it&#8217;s better to solve a bunch of issues at the blockchain level instead of forcing developers to find workarounds, but given enough time, developers will find smart workarounds. Every day, the Ethereum and Solana ecosystems are able to handle incrementally more use cases a little bit better.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Flow needs to win the next wave of developers coming from web2</strong> which will require changing the narrative to reflect reality (&#128075;) and building momentum.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, when I talked to Flow&#8217;s Product Lead Layne, she pushed back on my definition of an ecosystem: &#8220;A vibrant blockchain ecosystem is one where people are having a great time with friends and experiencing things they otherwise wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; she argues. &#8220;It's way more than having developers build.&#8221;</p><p>The world&#8217;s coolest amusement park isn&#8217;t fun if it&#8217;s empty. The world&#8217;s best designed product is useless without users. And Flow believes that a consumer-friendly blockchain ecosystem is only as good as the unique experiences it enables, ideally together.&nbsp;</p><p>Unique experiences drive Flow&#8217;s tokenomics, too.</p><h3><strong>Flowkenomics&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>We&#8217;ve gotten this far without talking much about the value of FLOW token, because it&#8217;s really not a prominent part of the story yet.

FLOW&#8217;s value will be based, like so many other things, on <strong>supply and demand</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Let&#8217;s start on the supply side. </p><p>Flow is a proof of stake blockchain, which means that all of the nodes stake FLOW tokens and receive a reward in FLOW tokens for running the network successfully (or are punished for bad behavior via token slashing). Because of Flow&#8217;s multi-node architecture, relative rewards among node types will change over time in order to facilitate the right balance of nodes.

support tens of thousands of Consensus nodes over time, making it incredibly decentralized where it matters.&nbsp;</p><p>As a reward for operating and protecting the network, validators are rewarded in FLOW tokens generated by inflating the token supply on the network. At launch, there were 1.25 billion FLOW tokens, and over the first four years, the total supply is only expected to increase by 162 million tokens, or 13%, all of which will go to staked validators.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, Flow&#8217;s tokenomics are straightforward on the supply side. It&#8217;s a <strong>low-inflation Proof-of-Stake chain</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Things get more interesting on the demand side. Demand for FLOW tokens is directly tied to creating products that people want to use, in a few ways.&nbsp;</p><p>First, there are the <strong>fees. </strong>Flow charges users, or the apps they&#8217;re using, two fees:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p><em><strong>Transaction fees</strong> cover the fees for a transaction to be submitted and included in a block.</em></p></li><li><p><em><strong>Computation fees </strong>are added for more complex operations that require computation beyond updating balances.</em></p></li></ol><p>While rewards inflate the supply, <strong>fees</strong> effectively lower it. Fees collected by the network are used as part of the reward payout each epoch. More fees mean less newly minted FLOW is needed for rewards.&nbsp;</p><p>Another main driver of demand is that Flow requires FLOW deposits for the creation and storage of all assets. Accounts need to pay a &#8220;<a href="https://forum.onflow.org/t/storage-limit-and-account-minimum-balance/799">minimum account balance</a>&#8221; to cover the storage used by their account. Currently, the minimum account balance is a super low <a href="https://forum.onflow.org/t/account-minimum-balance-increase-7-21-21/2172">0.04 FLOW</a> (or $0.2272) for 400KB, covered by Flow&#8217;s treasury. As users own and store more stuff, the cost of storage goes up. Importantly, developers can and often do pay that cost for users, as was the case in the Matrix World onboarding I showed earlier.&nbsp;</p><p>On a technical level, this is how FLOW&#8217;s tokenomics work today: more great products- &#8594; more usage and storage &#8594; more fees and higher balances &#8594; more demand for a slowly- or non-inflating supply of FLOW.</p><p>The big unlock coming soon, though, is <strong>full FLOW coin support in Dapper Wallet</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Users will be able to hold FLOW, earn FLOW, and spend FLOW. In addition to dollars, people will be able to buy Top Shot moments with FLOW. At the very least, they&#8217;d save on the ~5% credit card fees, but it&#8217;s not hard to imagine that Flow would offer special rewards and perks for paying in FLOW to incentivize usage.&nbsp;</p><p>As more partnerships with top IP holders like the NFL and La Liga bring more people to Flow and incentivize them to spend in FLOW, it will create more demand for a limited supply of FLOW.&nbsp;</p><p>As more native games and worlds like Cyptoys and Genies bring a new, younger audience (and their parents&#8217; money) into Flow, it will create more demand for a limited supply of FLOW.&nbsp;</p><p>As more people earn, hold, stake, and transact in FLOW, it will create more of an incentive for people to stay inside of the Flow ecosystem, which should attract more new developers, which should attract more users, and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, the most complex parts of the process are done. We&#8217;re picking up Flowmentum.</p><h3><strong>Flowmentum</strong></h3><p>Flow has made a series of non-obvious bets.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>It built a blockchain built to support complex, growing, and evolving worlds sustainably for a long-term.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>It used an entirely novel multi-node architecture, and wrote its own programming language from scratch.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>It focused on mainstream consumers and kids instead of crypto-natives.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>It set itself a definition of decentralization that includes accessibility, not just initial node distribution.</p></li></ul><p>As a result, it suffered through its own post-Top-Shot-craze mini-winter while other chains&#8217; ecosystems flourished over the past year.

That&#8217;s the wild beauty of innovation and of composability.&nbsp;</p><p>But a world in which Flow has as big an impact as its team thinks it can is one in which people own their digital assets as smoothly and certainly as they own their physical ones. It&#8217;s a world in which people shape the platforms they use, and take part in the upside from their collective success. It&#8217;s a world in which kids have the power to create not just content or products, but the economies that surround them as well.&nbsp;</p><p>If it takes a few years of centralized effort upfront to build a richer decentralized future for billions of people, that&#8217;s a trade-off that Flow is willing to make. There&#8217;s a long way between here and there, but if anyone can pull it off, my FLOW is on the team that&#8217;s repeatedly proven they know how to bring normies into web3.</p><p>Maybe the greatest arbitrage in crypto was not caring what other people in crypto think. </p><div><hr></div><p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/damccormick13">Dan</a> for editing, and to Roham, Mik, Dete, Layne, Trevor, Chris, Will, Emilio, Brett, and Akash for your input!</em></p><div><hr></div><p>Thanks for reading, and see you on Thursday,</p><p>Packy</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ukraine]]></title><description><![CDATA[Resources, Links, and a Little Optimism]]></description><link>https://www.notboring.co/p/ukraine-fc5</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.notboring.co/p/ukraine-fc5</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Packy McCormick]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 13:57:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3fbd171-77c3-4ecf-8330-cbe478730a0b_1200x800.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Welcome to the&nbsp;<strong>1,341&nbsp;newly Not Boring people&nbsp;</strong>who have joined us since our last Monday piece!

Since the start of COVID, with more money flooding the market and more deals happening more quickly over Zoom, the venture market has jumped to a higher state of complexity. Very valuable companies like AngelList, DocuSign, and Carta (recently valued at $7.4 billion) help to wrangle some of that entropy with software. But there&#8217;s still a big infrastructural puzzle piece missing.&nbsp;</p><p>The private markets need standard metrics.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>So, the private markets need <a href="https://standardmetrics.io/">Standard Metrics</a>.</strong></p><p>Standard Metrics&#8217; goal is to <strong>build a data and relationship graph for the private capital markets</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>That&#8217;s a deceptively tricky goal to achieve. Others have tried and failed to build a &#8220;Bloomberg for the Private Markets,&#8221; one resource to provide the same level of information and transparency to the private markets that public market investors have access to.&nbsp;</p><p>But Standard Metrics is starting with a more bite-sized ambition: <strong>get VCs to use its product</strong> to track the handful of metrics that matter most for their portfolio companies, like Cash in Bank, Revenue, Monthly Burn, and Gross Margin.&nbsp;</p><p>Win the VCs, the logic goes, and you can win their portfolio companies and their LPs, all of whom come with their own set of VC relationships, each of which come with fresh portfolio companies and LPs. When the spark catches, it can spread like wildfire.&nbsp;</p><p>VC to Portfolio Company. Portfolio Company to VC. VC to LP. LP to many VCs. Many VCs to Many LPs <em>and</em> Portfolio Companies. Slowly at first, and then suddenly, you become the <strong>standard</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>To help set the standard, today, Standard Metrics is announcing a <strong>rebrand from Quaestor to Standard Metrics</strong> and a fresh <strong>$23.7 million Series A led by 8VC</strong>, which incubated the company in 2020, with participation from Spark Capital, Slack Fund, Fin VC, Alpha Edison, Kindergarten Ventures, First Trust Capital Partners, January Capital, and Not Boring Capital, among other funds. Individual investors include a16z&#8217;s Sriram Krishnan, Bain Capital Ventures&#8217; Merritt Hummer, Quiet Capital&#8217;s Morgan Livermore, Meritech&#8217;s Craig Sherman, and Redpoint&#8217;s Medha Agarwal. (Actually, it was $3.7 million in notes and a $20 million Series A. Precision around metrics is important!)&nbsp;</p><p>When you build for VCs, your customers can also become your investors, and your investors can become your customers. That&#8217;s true here.&nbsp;</p><p>The hard part is: to set the standard for an industry, you need to win over most of the industry participants. Standard Metrics will need to displace incumbents and stand out among newer companies that look like competition on the surface. Getting that right requires the <strong>right timing</strong>, the <strong>right team</strong>, and the <strong>right strategic bets</strong>.

The Entropy Wranglers capture a lot of value, and they themselves create a platform for more entropy, and then new players come along and wrangle <em>that </em>entropy.</p><p>Think about the music industry.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff9a7e46-a405-40cb-acc4-ad3ebe3020c9_1008x804.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff9a7e46-a405-40cb-acc4-ad3ebe3020c9_1008x804.png" width="1008" height="804" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ff9a7e46-a405-40cb-acc4-ad3ebe3020c9_1008x804.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:804,&quot;width&quot;:1008,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff9a7e46-a405-40cb-acc4-ad3ebe3020c9_1008x804.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff9a7e46-a405-40cb-acc4-ad3ebe3020c9_1008x804.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff9a7e46-a405-40cb-acc4-ad3ebe3020c9_1008x804.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff9a7e46-a405-40cb-acc4-ad3ebe3020c9_1008x804.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Source: RIAA, annotated by Not Boring</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Napster and other file sharing services wrought chaos on the market; <strong>Spotify</strong> worked with all of the parties involved to bring order to the chaos. Today, it&#8217;s worth $29 billion.&nbsp;Spotify made it easier for more people to publish music &#8212; higher entropy &#8212; but it&#8217;s hard for most of them to make a living. That creates an opening for a new Wrangler, maybe a Music NFT platform like <a href="https://www.sound.xyz/">sound.xyz</a>. z</p><p>It doesn&#8217;t have to be that dramatic. An Entropy Wrangler doesn&#8217;t have to save an industry from decline. <strong>Google</strong>, for example, took advantage of the good chaos created by the internet&#8217;s rapid growth by building a tool that made sense of it all. It set the standard, and leagues of SEO specialists fight to follow it. In the process, it indexed itself to the growth of the internet. That&#8217;s been kind to Google shareholders.&nbsp;</p><p>That&#8217;s the kind of Entropy Wrangler Standard Metrics is building, bringing order to the chaos and opportunity brought on by the growth of venture and web3 investing over the past couple of years. In the process, it hopes to become an indexed bet on the growth of private market investing.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>The Quaestor Quest</strong></h3><p>So the <strong>timing</strong> is perfect. How about the <strong>team</strong>?&nbsp;</p><p>They&#8217;re intimately familiar with the problem.&nbsp;</p><p>Before there was Standard Metrics, there was Quaestor. And before Quaestor, there were spreadsheets. Lots and lots of spreadsheets.&nbsp;</p><p>Very often, venture capitalists fund people who are trying to solve a pain point in their personal or professional lives. Occasionally, VCs spin up their own companies &#8211; called <strong>incubation</strong> &#8211; by identifying a hole in the market with no solution and bringing in someone to lead a company to fill it. It&#8217;s very rare to find stories about the overlap in that Venn Diagram: VCs incubating companies to solve their <em>own</em> pain points.&nbsp;</p><p>That&#8217;s how Standard Metrics began its life as Quaestor, inside the walls of 8VC. The venture capital firm&#8217;s partners realized that the companies in their portfolio, some of the most technically sophisticated in the world including Anduril, Asana, The Boring Company, Cityblock, Flexport, Oculus, Palantir, and Wish, were still updating them via spreadsheets (at best) and PDFs (yuck), and that there might be an opportunity to fix that with software.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the company&#8217;s <a href="https://medium.com/@quaestortech/announcing-quaestors-seed-round-and-design-partners-f8de4895a18e">announcement post</a> in July 2020, &#8220;Quaestor was born from a simple question: <strong>why is it so difficult for startups and investors to collaborate around financial data and business metrics?</strong>&#8221;</p><p>I&#8217;ve had this experience first-hand from both sides of the table, and it&#8217;s a surprisingly real problem for something seemingly so simple.&nbsp;</p><p>At Breather, we tried a bunch of things to keep our board members up to date on metrics, from the standard monthly investor update and quarterly board deck &#8211; which I&#8217;m sure some junior person on their team had to put into a spreadsheet &#8211; to operating models to an investor dashboard in Looker. Inevitably, that Looker got bloated with different requests for specific data points or some investor&#8217;s favorite metric based on their experience with another quasi-analogous company. It was also as certain as death and taxes that an investor would see a number, take it out of context, and blow up its importance, wasting hours of the exec team and data team&#8217;s time.&nbsp;</p><p>As an investor &#8211; albeit a non-lead one usually without data rights &#8211; I&#8217;m at the mercy of whatever founders decide to put in that month or quarter&#8217;s update. Key metrics change often, companies report things differently, and all of that information is squirreled away somewhere in my inbox until I take the time to manually move it from email to Airtable. It makes staying on top of portfolio companies&#8217; performance a bigger challenge than it needs to be.&nbsp;</p><p>On the individual level, it&#8217;s a pain. At the system level, it&#8217;s a huge drain of time and resources:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Companies spend too much time pulling together numbers for investors.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Investors spend too much time manually tracking and cleaning data, if they do it at all.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Surprises lead to tension between companies and their investors, which means that the relationships aren&#8217;t as productive as they could be.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Investors don&#8217;t allocate money as effectively as they could to the most productive companies.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The most productive companies need to waste too much time fundraising when they could just focus on building their businesses.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>If the solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing humanity lie in the technological innovation of talented entrepreneurs, then wasting their time going back and forth on metrics should be a crime. Conversely, tools that save entrepreneurs time and let them focus on the things they&#8217;re uniquely good at should generate a ton of leverage.&nbsp;</p><p>So the team at 8VC, including partners Joe Lonsdale and Alex Moore, put together a co-founding team to go build it, with a mix of operator and investor DNA:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/kevinleehsu">Kevin Hsu</a> was doing an EIR stint at 8VC after being an early PM at Carta, bringing deeply relevant experience to the problem.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/denykhoung">Deny Khoung</a> worked as a designer at 8VC, helping spin up incubated companies like <a href="https://www.affinity.co/">Affinity</a>.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/jmelaskyriazi">John Melas-Kyriazi</a> joined as CEO after five years as a VC at Spark Capital.</p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fe5ebac-a533-42f6-aa2d-63745a5f1017_908x683.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fe5ebac-a533-42f6-aa2d-63745a5f1017_908x683.png" width="908" height="683" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9fe5ebac-a533-42f6-aa2d-63745a5f1017_908x683.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:683,&quot;width&quot;:908,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fe5ebac-a533-42f6-aa2d-63745a5f1017_908x683.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fe5ebac-a533-42f6-aa2d-63745a5f1017_908x683.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fe5ebac-a533-42f6-aa2d-63745a5f1017_908x683.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fe5ebac-a533-42f6-aa2d-63745a5f1017_908x683.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Standard Metrics Co-Founders Hsu, Melas-Kyriazi, and Khoung</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>The trio, which had a mix of operator and investor DNA with a sprinkle of experience building best-in-class tools for the space, spun out of 8VC in March 2020 as Quaestor, named after the treasurers of Ancient Rome.&nbsp;</p><p><em>(They&#8217;re not the only ones who liked the name for a money-related business &#8211;

I asked John why they chose those eight when each vertical has its own metrics, and he explained:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>There are metrics that apply to every company, and then there are metrics that are useful for evaluating specific subsectors (e.g. SaaS, consumer apps, marketplaces, etc.). We are building out sector-specific standards as well as global standards, but starting with global ones.</em></p></blockquote><p>The approach is subtly different than Visible.vc&#8217;s. While both companies let investors customize metrics, <strong>Standard Metrics always includes the same eight metrics</strong>, whereas Visible.vc lets investors start from scratch for each segment or even portfolio company.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01cb1a85-7549-4f20-9f9d-312037505475_908x400.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01cb1a85-7549-4f20-9f9d-312037505475_908x400.png" width="908" height="400" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/01cb1a85-7549-4f20-9f9d-312037505475_908x400.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:400,&quot;width&quot;:908,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01cb1a85-7549-4f20-9f9d-312037505475_908x400.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01cb1a85-7549-4f20-9f9d-312037505475_908x400.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01cb1a85-7549-4f20-9f9d-312037505475_908x400.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01cb1a85-7549-4f20-9f9d-312037505475_908x400.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Visible.vc</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>On the surface, Visible.vc&#8217;s approach might appear to make more sense. <em>Of course</em> customers should get to choose for themselves, and of course different types of companies should have different sets of metrics.&nbsp;</p><p>And if you&#8217;re building a purely SaaS product, it probably is. But Standard Metrics has a bigger vision: it&#8217;s trying to build a <strong>data and relationship graph</strong> on top of which it and others can build a series of apps. Today, the data that investors get from companies is all over the place, negotiated on a case-by-case basis, and practically impossible to compare consistently. So to start, Standard Metrics needs to wrangle that entropy and build a standardized set of metrics.</p><p>In other words, just as equity is the atomic unit on top of which Carta built a series of products, <strong>operational metrics are the atomic unit on top of which Standard Metrics will build a series of products</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Standard Metrics wants to build <strong>the core system of record for operational metrics</strong>, the main source of truth investors rely on to run their businesses and make decisions. &#8220;Standards allow everyone to move faster,&#8221; John explained, &#8220;and we think there are enormous advantages to standardization of data through software. For example:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>We can make it lightning fast and automated for companies to pull their metrics of interest into our platform if those metrics are standardized and accessible through various APIs. Also, we will be able to offer context to companies over time on their performance &#8212; for example, how do you stack up against other SaaS companies in your lead investor's portfolio in terms of ARR growth or NDR?</em></p></blockquote><p>But picking metrics is one thing, collecting them is another.

Third, and most importantly, investors are the ones paying for the software. <strong>Companies get Standard Metrics for free</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Choosing to target investors over companies seems like a minor thing, a matter of sequencing, but it&#8217;s a crucially important differentiator and the fastest way to set and collect the industry-standard metrics. There are a few reasons:</p><p>First, lead investors typically have the <strong>contractual right to receive data from the companies in which they invest</strong> and can request to receive the data points that they want, within reason (and often, as was my experience, outside of it).&nbsp;</p><p>Second, <strong>investors have the greatest need for standardized metrics</strong>. Companies should only be looking at the metrics that will help them make better decisions about their business, even if they&#8217;re totally different than the metrics that other businesses look at. Having standard metrics across portfolio companies as a starting point helps investors make better decisions about where to focus attention, whether to try to preempt a round, and how much to invest in follow-ons. Standardized metrics also help them report up to <em>their </em>investors: LPs. While companies might be the right customer for investor update software, investors are the right customers for standardized metrics.&nbsp;</p><p>Standard Metrics gives VCs one place to keep track of company updates, asks, and of course, metrics, across their entire portfolio:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c58b8ce-bb17-444d-a7cd-f3454ac07e76_900x566.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c58b8ce-bb17-444d-a7cd-f3454ac07e76_900x566.png" width="900" height="566" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0c58b8ce-bb17-444d-a7cd-f3454ac07e76_900x566.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:566,&quot;width&quot;:900,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c58b8ce-bb17-444d-a7cd-f3454ac07e76_900x566.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c58b8ce-bb17-444d-a7cd-f3454ac07e76_900x566.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c58b8ce-bb17-444d-a7cd-f3454ac07e76_900x566.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c58b8ce-bb17-444d-a7cd-f3454ac07e76_900x566.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Standard Metrics</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>The third reason is the most important: <strong>VCs are the best node in the web of private market investing relationships from which to grow rapidly.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In <em><a href="https://tribecap.co/1-trillion-in-equity-how-carta-is-set-to-unlock-the-private-markets/">$1 Trillion in Equity: How Carta is set to unlock private markets</a></em>, a brilliant essay that I&#8217;ve quoted before, Tribe Capital wrote about why it believed Carta was going to be such a special company.

Great companies are going public later in their life, others are going public via SPAC long before they should, and many of the same investors are playing late stage venture, crypto, and public equities, and comparing opportunities in each against each other.&nbsp;</p><p>In a world in which Standard Metrics is ubiquitous, investors will more effectively allocate capital to the most important companies whether they&#8217;re public or private.

There is no time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>The World Without Time. </strong>If time doesn&#8217;t exist, how do we make sense of this new, timeless world? Instead of a linear time, Rovelli offers in its place a &#8220;net of interconnected events, where the variables in play adhere to probabilistic rules.&#8221; Instead of time and objects, &#8220;There are only events and relations.&#8221;</p></li><li><p><strong>The Sources of Time. </strong>Ok ok cool BUT &#8230; evolution occurs, erosion reshapes landscapes, we experience time, we have memories of the past, we <em>can&#8217;t</em> remember the future. Where does the sense of time&#8217;s flow come from if time isn&#8217;t real? Rovelli offers up some explanations here based on the best thinking today. Ultimately, what we experience as time is &#8220;a multilayered, complex concept with multiple, distinct properties deriving from various different approximations.&#8221;&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>This is trippy stuff.&nbsp;</p><p>Whenever I fly, I have a cranberry vodka. I&#8217;m not sure why. I don&#8217;t drink cranberry vodka on the ground. But somehow, it&#8217;s become my plane drink. So earlier this month, I found myself 1.5 cranberry vodkas deep on a flight, sitting aisle with Puja by the window and Dev asleep in his carseat between us. And I was absolutely giddy.&nbsp;</p><p>At the risk of waking the baby and ruining the flight for us and everyone around us, I kept passing my iPad over to Puja, watching her reaction expectantly as she read just-highlighted sections I pointed at, like this:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>Dear reader, pause for a moment to let this conclusion sink in. In my opinion, it is the <strong>most astounding conclusion arrived at in the whole of contemporary physics</strong>. It simply makes no sense to ask which moment in the life of your sister on Proxima b </em>[a planet far, far away]<em> corresponds to </em>now&#8230;</p><p><em><strong>The notion of &#8220;the present&#8221; refers to things that are close to us, not anything that is far away. Our &#8220;present&#8221; does not extend throughout the universe.</strong> It is like a bubble around us&#8230;</em></p><p><em><strong>The idea that a well-defined </strong></em><strong>now </strong><em><strong>exists throughout the universe is an illusion</strong>, an illegitimate extrapolation of our own experience... The &#8220;present of the universe&#8221; is meaningless.</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>There is no universal now.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>There&#8217;s not a moment that&#8217;s the same on a far away planet as the one you&#8217;re experiencing right now &#8211; not as measured on a clock, just&#8230; at all. I, too, like you might be right now, tried imagining it, and <em>of course </em>there&#8217;s a moment that&#8217;s happening now, there, even if we can&#8217;t access it. But, apparently, there&#8217;s really not. According to Rovelli, asking what&#8217;s happening on Proxima b <em>now </em>is like me sitting in New York and wondering what&#8217;s happening in Beijing <em>here.&nbsp;</em></p><p>That&#8217;s just one of the five or six sections I passed to Puja.

Each interaction with any number of systems creates a parallel universe. Many Worlds predicts infinite universes. Although many physicists subscribe to the Many Worlds interpretation, Rovelli doesn&#8217;t.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, Rovelli introduced his own interpretation in 1994: <strong>relational quantum mechanics (RQM)</strong>. In RQM, the interpretation he uses throughout Helgoland:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>The properties of an object </em>are <em>the way in which it acts upon other objects; <strong>reality is this web of interactions</strong>. Instead of seeing the physical world as a collection of objects with definite properties, <strong>quantum theory invites us to see the physical world as a net of relations</strong>. Objects are its nodes.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>Observers aren&#8217;t just scientists in a lab, and observations aren&#8217;t just scientific measurements. Quantum theory, according to Rovelli, &#8220;describes how <strong>every</strong> physical object manifests itself to <strong>any other</strong> physical object.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>In one example, Rovelli lays out a thought experiment on &#8220;the most enchanted and dreamy of the quantum phenomena. <em>Entanglement. </em>It is the phenomenon by which two distant objects maintain a kind of weird connection, as if they continued to speak to each other from afar.&#8221; Einstein once described entanglement as &#8220;spooky action at a distance.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>He comes to an understanding of entanglement that isn&#8217;t as spooky as two photons communicating instantaneously &#8211; faster than the speed of light &#8211; at great distances. It requires the introduction of a third object &#8211; &#8220;the correlation manifests itself when the two correlated objects <em>both </em>interact with this third object&#8221; &#8211; but, he writes, &#8220;it comes at a cost: <strong>no universal set of facts exists</strong>.&#8221;</p><p>Nothing exists except in its interactions with other things. Everything is a <strong>web of relations.</strong></p><p>According to Rovelli, &#8220;A single equation (Heisenberg&#8217;s uncertainty principle: &#916;X&#916;P &#8805; &#8463;/2) codes quantum theory:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>It implies that the world is <strong>not continuous but granular</strong>.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>There is no infinite in going towards the small: <strong>things cannot get infinitely smaller</strong>.</p></li><li><p>It tells us <strong>the future is not determined by the present</strong>.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>It tells us that <strong>physical things have property in relation to other physical things</strong>, and that these <strong>properties make sense only when things interact</strong>.&#8221;&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>It&#8217;s hard to believe that this is how things work, but quantum theory remains undefeated. It&#8217;s the best science we have today. It&#8217;s more likely that this is essentially the way the world works than not. Our intuitions based on lived experience have misled us before.&nbsp;</p><p>People believed that the Earth was flat, until Ancient Greek scientists proved it was round (unless you&#8217;re <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2741935-kyrie-irving-explains-flat-earth-stance-says-there-is-no-real-picture-of-earth">Kyrie</a>). People believed that the Sun rotated around the Earth, until Copernicus showed them the light. As Rovelli wrote in <em>The Order of Time</em>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>That which seems intuitive to us now is the result of scientific and philosophical elaborations in the past.</em></p></blockquote><p>I have no reason not to believe Rovelli when he argues that we&#8217;re at another one of those moments, when our lived experience fails to capture the underlying reality. You shouldn&#8217;t trust my trust; I highly recommend you read the book yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>But for now, let&#8217;s believe him. Objects <em>only exist in relation to other objects. </em>The world isn&#8217;t made up of discrete objects made up of some fundamental matter; it&#8217;s a <strong>network of relations</strong>. In which case: woah.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d7921ca-8f81-4321-8fa9-c9ab1c5e667a_1008x661.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d7921ca-8f81-4321-8fa9-c9ab1c5e667a_1008x661.png" width="1008" height="661" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4d7921ca-8f81-4321-8fa9-c9ab1c5e667a_1008x661.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:661,&quot;width&quot;:1008,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d7921ca-8f81-4321-8fa9-c9ab1c5e667a_1008x661.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d7921ca-8f81-4321-8fa9-c9ab1c5e667a_1008x661.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d7921ca-8f81-4321-8fa9-c9ab1c5e667a_1008x661.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d7921ca-8f81-4321-8fa9-c9ab1c5e667a_1008x661.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>I&#8217;m skipping some of the most magical parts of the book here, like the story of the polymath Aleksander Bogdanov, the philosophy of the 2nd century Indian Buddhist thinker Nagarjuna that correctly outlined the shape of reality, how the brain makes meaning from relevant relative information, or how our vision functions in the opposite way than we think it does. Again, just go <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LR73RTL/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">read it</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But for now, I want to briefly discuss using relational quantum theory as a model.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>The Web of Relations as a Model&nbsp;</strong></h3><p><em><strong>Note</strong>: this section is really just me thinking out loud, and is meant to be a jumping off point.&nbsp;</em></p><p>In the last chapter of <em>Helgoland</em>,<em> </em>Rovelli writes of quantum theory:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>I think it is time to take this theory fully on board, for its nature to be discussed beyond the restricted circles of theoretical physicists and philosophers, to deposit its distilled honey, sweet and intoxicating, into the whole of contemporary culture.</em></p></blockquote><p>This is my fumbling attempt to discuss the theory in the context of the small piece of contemporary culture we cover here: technology, business, and markets. To be clear, I&#8217;m not arguing that quantum theory governs the markets or that because of relational quantum mechanics, web3 wins. &#8220;I read a book on Quantum Physics for Dummies and here&#8217;s why it means web3 will beat centralized corporations&#8221; would be the most techbro thing I could write. But as Rovelli writes:</p><blockquote><p><em>Even if remote from our direct everyday experience, the discovery of the nature of the quantum world is <strong>too radical to have no relevance to precisely such big open questions as the nature of the mind</strong>. Not because the mind or other phenomena that we still know little about are quantum phenomena, but because by modifying our conception of the physical world and of matter, <strong>the discovery of quanta changes the terms of our questions</strong>.</em></p></blockquote><p>Similarly, this understanding that the universe is made up of relations between objects, and that objects have no properties independent of other objects is too radical to not change the terms of our questions. I don&#8217;t have any profound insights &#8211; this is meant to be a conversation starter &#8211; but I think this is an interesting model: <strong>webs of relations versus static objects</strong>.</p><p>This might be another twist on the difference between <strong>complexity</strong> and <strong>reductionism</strong> that we discussed in <em><a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/the-laboratory-for-complex-problems">The Laboratory for Complex Problems</a>.</em> This might be another reason that technical teardowns of new technologies often miss the mark: the object itself is less important than the web of relations it enables.&nbsp;</p><p>While Nagarjuna intuited the idea that there is no independent existence around 200 CE, it took science nearly two millennia to begin to prove that intuition in theory and experiment. As our tools and technology get better, and as <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/idea-legos">ideas compose and compound</a>, we&#8217;re able to operate at a resolution that makes it possible to harness intuition.&nbsp;</p><p>It takes technology and progress to get to the natural state of things.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, I&#8217;ve <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/power-to-the-person">written in the past</a> that &#8220;we&#8217;re on an inexorable march towards individuals mattering more than institutions.&#8221; I&#8217;d amend that with the web of relations model in mind to say something like, &#8220;We&#8217;re moving towards an end-state in which the web of relations among individuals will be more powerful than institutions.&#8221; Or, &#8220;We&#8217;re moving from top-down to networked models, from <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/entropy-theory">lower entropy to higher entropy</a>.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcaeb3a4-5754-4a39-b7a0-63e4967dc102_1000x743.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcaeb3a4-5754-4a39-b7a0-63e4967dc102_1000x743.png" width="1000" height="743" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/dcaeb3a4-5754-4a39-b7a0-63e4967dc102_1000x743.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:743,&quot;width&quot;:1000,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcaeb3a4-5754-4a39-b7a0-63e4967dc102_1000x743.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcaeb3a4-5754-4a39-b7a0-63e4967dc102_1000x743.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcaeb3a4-5754-4a39-b7a0-63e4967dc102_1000x743.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcaeb3a4-5754-4a39-b7a0-63e4967dc102_1000x743.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>I hesitate to even bring web3 into the conversation, because while I think the set of tools that we&#8217;re calling web3 today are an important piece, the long arc bends towards a web of relations model regardless. The technologies that help bring legibility and usability to those webs will be extremely valuable. Tokenomics will certainly play a role in shaping behaviors, but non-web3 technologies will play a valuable role, too. If in a century or two, everyone exists economically as a node in a global network, we&#8217;re going to need AI to handle a lot for us, for example.&nbsp;</p><p>More practically today, it&#8217;s worth deeply understanding that <strong>things don&#8217;t have value independent of other things</strong>. The best-designed software is worthless without users. The stupidest jpeg is valuable if others believe it is. Memes pull the web of relations in their direction. As Rovelli argues, relations are the atomic unit:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>Relations make up our &#8220;I,&#8221; as our society, our cultural, spiritual, and political life. It is for this reason, I think, that everything we have been able to accomplish over the centuries has been achieved in a network of exchanges, collaborating.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>There are other things to explore here, like the value of reputation and relationships. If objects (or businesses, products, funds, etc&#8230;) are not valuable independent of a network, and if that&#8217;s becoming increasingly true as everything, including our attention and tastes, are becoming more fragmented, then it would seem that maintaining a good reputation in one&#8217;s subset of the network is more valuable than ever. Cutting yourself off from the web of relations is death. That&#8217;s a good check and balance in a system with fewer centralized gatekeepers.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#8217;s also maybe interesting to think about yourself as part of the whole &#8211; either the universe (I&#8217;ve coincidentally been using the <a href="https://dynamic.wakingup.com/shareOpenAccess/544cea">Waking Up</a> meditation app for the past three weeks and it&#8217;s a great pairing) or more specifically your professional web. &#8220;If the physical world is woven from the subtle interplay of images in mirrors reflected in other mirrors, without the metaphysical foundation of a material substance,&#8221; Rovelli suggests, &#8220;perhaps it becomes easier to recognize ourselves as part of that whole.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll think of hundreds more interpretations and extensions of this model (or you might ask me if I wrote this while hanging out with Snoop at a Super Bowl afterparty.) But I promised to be brief, and I&#8217;m starting to break that promise, so let&#8217;s move on.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Getting Comfortable with the Weird</strong></h3><p>The last point I want to make is that, at a very fundamental level, things are really fucking weird. Objects don&#8217;t have independent properties, despite all appearances to the contrary. There is no such thing as time outside of our experience of it.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, Rovelli builds time back up in <em>The Order of Time</em>, and he fits meaning into his relational model of the world in <em>Helgoland</em>. The discovery of quantum physics need not change our day-to-day lives at all. We can&#8217;t notice quantum properties. &#8220;At our scale,&#8221; Rovelli writes, &#8220;the world is like the wave-agitated surface of the ocean seen from the moon: the smooth surface of a blue marble.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>You can take the blue pill and go back to your normal life, right now.</p><p>But thinking about all of this should give us an excuse to pause and take the red pill, at least for a few minutes. Rovelli quotes Douglas Adams, the author of <em>The Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy, </em>who said:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>The fact that we live at the bottom of a deep gravity well, on the surface of a gas covered planet, going around a nuclear fireball 90 million miles away and think this to be normal is obviously some indication of how skewed our perspective tends to be.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>To me, understanding how much weirder the world really is than it seems, and how much different it works than even our best scientists like Einstein thought it worked a century ago, is an exhortation to embrace new, weird ideas and explore them with curiosity.&nbsp;</p><p>Rovelli has a series of lines in <em>Helgoland</em>, specifically in the &#8220;Naturalism Without Substance: Contextuality&#8221; section, on the &#8220;anti-metaphysical&#8221; spirit inspired by Ernst Mach, which he seems to have adopted as his own approach:</p><ol><li><p><em>The &#8220;anti-metaphysical&#8221; spirit that Mach promoted is an <strong>attitude of openness</strong>: We should not seek to teach the world how it should be. Let&#8217;s listen to the world instead, in order to learn from it how to think about it.&nbsp;</em></p></li><li><p><em>Our prejudices concerning how reality is made are just the result of our experience. Our experience is limited. <strong>We cannot take as gospel truth generalizations that we have made in the past.</strong></em></p></li><li><p><em><strong>We must take seriously the new things we learn about the world</strong>, even if they clash with our preconceptions about how reality is constituted.</em></p></li><li><p><em>The best way to learn is to <strong>interact with the world while seeking to understand it</strong>, readjusting our mental schemes to what we encounter and find.&nbsp;</em></p></li><li><p><em>I believe that we <strong>need to adapt our philosophy to our science</strong>, and not our science to our philosophy.&nbsp;</em></p></li></ol><p>Rovelli is speaking to scientists, specifically those who have a hard time accepting relational quantum mechanics because it <em>seems </em>off, but I think they&#8217;re much more broadly applicable. If you forget every word you read in Not Boring but print those out and put them on your wall, I&#8217;ll have done my job.&nbsp;</p><p>In a century, quantum physics might be replaced by science that&#8217;s even better at describing the world and all of the cutting edge technologies that we talk about here will certainly be very old news. I&#8217;d bet all of my money that what will still be valuable in that world is the ability to learn new things and take them seriously, and, of course, the ability to operate as an ephemeral node in a web of relations.</p><div><hr></div><p>How did you like this week&#8217;s Not Boring?

There are a bunch of reasons for that, but one of the main ones is that I&#8217;m just a business model nerd, and new tools create opportunities for new business models. But I love digging into innovative and clever models wherever I find them, and today&#8217;s focus, <a href="https://www.snappr.com/">Snappr</a>, is a perfect example. </p><p>It started as an on-demand self-service marketplace for professional photography, and by listening to its clients, it&#8217;s built an enterprise SaaS and API offering uniquely enabled by the self-service business. It&#8217;s a model and product roadmap that you probably couldn&#8217;t have drawn up ahead of time, but that makes perfect sense looking backwards. And it&#8217;s a case study in how to build an API-first business, last, once all of the right pieces are in place.</p><p>Today&#8217;s post is a Sponsored Deep Dive on a company that I invested in through Not Boring Capital. As always, I only write Sponsored Deep Dives on companies I would invest in, and in most cases, I actually have. You can read my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K24dAK5k7LHuYMsJMyd2acDSqw8bEdJm_pciVrmVNXA/edit?usp=sharing">thought process on deep dives here</a>.

There, you&#8217;ll find all sorts of complexity. Abstracting it away is the API&#8217;s raison d&#8217;&#234;tre.</p><p>Most API-first giants, like Stripe, Twilio, and Plaid, start with the software and realize that getting the software right actually requires a lot of undercover schlep.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.snappr.com/">Snappr</a>, on the other hand, started with the hardest part first. It built an on-demand, self-service, B2C-centric photography marketplace before realizing that all of that work put it in the perfect position to build the software infrastructure for the lifeblood of the internet: <strong>visual content</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Other companies have tried to build photography marketplaces or visual content workflow software to serve the enterprise, but starting upmarket has turned out to be a challenging approach. Counterintuitively, and surprisingly even to the Snappr team, the right approach seems to be to start by building out a self-service, on-demand photography marketplace serving mainly consumers, and then to work up to enterprises.&nbsp;</p><p>Somehow, in 2017, that marketplace opportunity was still wide open. In the era of on-demand everything, booking a photographer was still a nightmare. I experienced it myself.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&#8217;ve had to book a family photo shoot recently, this story might sound familiar. It was shocking to me. I almost &#8230; snapped.&nbsp;</p><p>In the fall of 2020, about a month after Dev was born, I decided it would be a nice idea to book a photographer to do a family photo shoot. I searched on Google, found someone with pretty good reviews nearby, and hopped on a call with her. She seemed nice and the price was OK, something like $300. A little expensive, but for a couple hours and hundreds of pictures of our little man that we&#8217;d get to use for Christmas cards and keep and cherish forever, not bad!&nbsp;</p><p>On the day of the shoot, we drove to a park all dressed up in our matching outfits. We met the photographer, we&#8217;ll call her Sally (not her real name), and she was lovely! Throughout the shoot, she showed us previews of the pictures, and they were great. What a day!&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of the session, as we were saying our goodbyes and getting ready to go home, Sally asked us when we wanted to schedule a Zoom to see the pictures. &#8220;Oh no, that&#8217;s OK!&#8221; I said, &#8220;It&#8217;s 2020, you should be able to just put them in a Dropbox and send them over to us, thanks!&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do that,&#8221; said Sally, ominously, a shadow darkening her face.&nbsp;</p><p>Turns out, <strong>the price that we paid for the photo shoot&#8230; didn&#8217;t actually include the photos</strong>! That was separate. We&#8217;d have to buy the prints. &#8220;Well, what if we just want the digital versions?&#8221; I inquired. Nope. We&#8217;d only get the digital version of whichever physical prints we bought. And each physical print cost a minimum of $150!!!&nbsp;</p><p>I don&#8217;t get mad often, but I was fucking fuming. I went home and re-checked the price list and my emails with Sally. Neither the price list nor Sally ever said that we would have to pay per photo to get digital access to the photos. We&#8217;d been bamboozled!&nbsp;</p><p>It was a racket, but what could you do, not keep those memories? I gave in and bought four prints and a 25 pack of Christmas cards. It cost $799.69 (nice, but not nice), in addition to the $300 we paid upfront. I even kept the receipt to prove it. I never keep the receipt.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F085d88f9-8c35-4df6-926b-cdc413d9d65a_566x387.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F085d88f9-8c35-4df6-926b-cdc413d9d65a_566x387.png" width="566" height="387" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/085d88f9-8c35-4df6-926b-cdc413d9d65a_566x387.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:387,&quot;width&quot;:566,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F085d88f9-8c35-4df6-926b-cdc413d9d65a_566x387.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F085d88f9-8c35-4df6-926b-cdc413d9d65a_566x387.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F085d88f9-8c35-4df6-926b-cdc413d9d65a_566x387.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F085d88f9-8c35-4df6-926b-cdc413d9d65a_566x387.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>My Real Receipt from &#8220;Sally&#8221;</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>It was a jarring experience, partially because it&#8217;s such an uncommon one at this point. Today, practically everything that consumers spend money on is mediated through an online platform with full price transparency.

Price transparency! All-inclusive!</p><p>If I&#8217;d booked with Snappr, the whole thing would have cost me less than a quarter of what Sally cost. As a consumer, that&#8217;s exactly what I needed.&nbsp;</p><p>But as a professional newsletter writer who needs to write about new models, a B2C photography marketplace probably wouldn&#8217;t be enough to do the trick.</p><p>The web2 marketplace model is tried and true. I even dunked on it a little bit when I wrote about <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/braintrust-fighting-capitalism-with">Braintrust</a> last week. If Snappr were following the familiar B2C Marketplace playbook &#8211; build up supply and demand, win the market, raise take rates by raising fees on both sides &#8211; we probably wouldn&#8217;t be here talking about it today.&nbsp;</p><p>But we <em>are </em>here, so what&#8217;s up?&nbsp;</p><p>Snappr is running a <strong>B2C2B2PLG</strong> model to perfection and writing a new playbook.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Haven&#8217;t heard of the B2C2B2PLG model before? That&#8217;s probably because I just made it up. I should explain.&nbsp;</p><p>Snappr has two business lines: <strong>Snappr Shoots</strong> and <strong>Snappr Workflows.</strong> Snapper Shoots is the photography marketplace business that&#8217;s open access, self-service, and asks customers to book and pay for one shoot at a time. It&#8217;s a consumer-like experience whose revenue is roughly 2/3 consumer and 1/3 businesses (mainly SMB). Snappr Workflows is the visual content SaaS and infrastructure offering for enterprises. With Workflows, enterprises can automate their visual content pipeline from beginning to end with Snappr&#8217;s APIs, and source, edit, and manage visual content in bulk.</p><p>Workflows is a bold expansion. In four years, <strong>Snappr </strong>has become the leading on-demand photography marketplace:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>It&#8217;s <strong>processed over 120 million photos</strong> and edited more than 40 million of them.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Its network <strong>covers 90% of the US population</strong>, 95% of Canada, 88% of the UK, and 77% of Australia, among others&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Its <strong>revenue has grown at a 14% compound monthly growth rate (CMGR)</strong> since it started earning money.</p></li><li><p>Its <strong>gross merchandise value (GMV) is in the tens of millions of dollars</strong>, and it captures a strong percentage of that as revenue.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The company has <strong>raised $13 million</strong> and has <strong>only spent a fraction </strong>of it to accomplish all that.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>The majority of the company&#8217;s revenue now comes from enterprise (</strong>two-thirds of the company&#8217;s revenue now comes from B2B use-cases more broadly).</p></li></ul><p>The company could have kept its head down and built a really nice photography marketplace business. Instead, it&#8217;s taking all of the resources it&#8217;s built up and launching <strong>Snappr Workflows</strong>, its SaaS and API product aimed at the enterprise clients who demand it and the mid-market clients Snappr hasn&#8217;t yet been able to serve.&nbsp;</p><p>The secret to Snappr&#8217;s success is that the Shoots business feeds the Workflows business, in four main ways:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p><strong>Solves the Chicken and Egg Problem for Enterprises</strong>. Enterprises need national supply (photographers and editors) overnight, which is impossible to build on its own. When they call, you need to be ready, or you blow your chance.

Sometimes, companies go to great lengths to tell a coherent narrative that makes the company&#8217;s history look like the unfolding of a masterfully orchestrated master plan. That&#8217;s rarely the case.&nbsp;</p><p>In Snappr&#8217;s case, all of the ingredients were there for a smart consultant to piece together.&nbsp;</p><p>There was the <strong>market trend</strong>. Digital photos were becoming a bigger part of both consumers&#8217; and businesses&#8217; identities. The internet had become more visual. Airbnb was a <a href="https://www.snappr.com/enterprise-blog/photography-that-launched-an-empire-how-airbnb-transformed-their-business-with-professional-photography">case study</a> for the value of high-quality photography. People and businesses alike would need, and be willing to pay for, higher-quality photos.&nbsp;</p><p>Then there was the <strong>market structure</strong>. I didn&#8217;t know this until Matt told me, but there was only one services industry more fragmented pre-marketplaces than the photography industry: taxis. Putting a digital marketplace on top of that industry resulted in multiple multi-deca-billion dollar companies, including Uber, Lyft, and Didi.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike those companies, though, who would need to await the arrival of self-driving cars to produce software margins, the margin expansion opportunities for photography were manifold, from editing to storage to asset management to distribution.&nbsp;</p><p>You&#8217;d just need to grab the consumer market as a wedge, build up liquidity, write some code, sell the whole package to enterprises, and Bob&#8217;s your uncle.</p><p>Well, I got to ask Matt directly whether the plan all along was to go from B2C to B2B to SaaS and infrastructure.&nbsp;</p><p>The answer was a resounding, Australian-accented &#8220;no.&#8221; (noyr?)&nbsp;</p><div id="youtube2-GZgL8_IcZ3k" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;GZgL8_IcZ3k&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:&quot;28s&quot;,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GZgL8_IcZ3k?start=28s&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>Through his experience running GownTown, Matt just saw that there might be an opportunity to build a marketplace for graduation photographers.

When I spoke to Matt recently, he said that they still only accept one out of ten photographers who apply in New York City after a four-stage vetting process that includes looking at a photographer&#8217;s portfolio and equipment, piece-by-piece. Photographers who do get approved get approved on a use-case-by-use-case basis: I might be really good at taking pictures of burgers but horrible at taking pictures of babies, so Snappr won&#8217;t let me near the little ones.&nbsp;</p><p>Matt told me that particularly in big cities, most of the photographers come inbound thanks to Snappr&#8217;s strong brand recognition and word of mouth from other photographers. They&#8217;re attracted by what they <em>don&#8217;t</em> have to do &#8211; sales and marketing, back and forth with clients, billing &#8211; and by the higher effective rates they make through Snappr.&nbsp;</p><p>Importantly for both sides, Snappr tips the traditional photography IP model on its head. Snappr sometimes charges more upfront than some other photographers, like our friend Sally, but that <strong>price includes everything</strong>. So instead of charging some low rate to lure you in and then charging for the photos, Snappr does what any logical person in the whole entire world would imagine they&#8217;d do: they give one price upfront (plus a small trust &amp; safety fee). That price comes with all of the photos from the shoot, as it should.

The company laid off 25 employees. They prepared for the worst&#8230;&nbsp;</p><p>&#8230; and the worst never came. It was the opposite, in fact. While consumer bookings fell off a cliff, enterprise demand started to take off. It was puzzling at first, but it was obvious in hindsight: COVID, as we&#8217;ve all heard thousands of times, accelerated the shift to ecommerce. Product photography is the lifeblood of ecommerce. Everything that was offline moved online, and all of it needed pictures.&nbsp;</p><p>During COVID, <strong>enterprise became the majority of the business</strong>, and it&#8217;s remained that way since, even as the self-service segment has bounced back. Snappr re-hired all of the positions it eliminated, and added a bunch of new ones (there are <a href="https://www.snappr.com/careers">tons of open roles today</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Far from failing, Snappr announced <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/snappr-captures-10m-series-a-to-build-out-visual-content-marketplace/">a $10 million Series A</a> led by <a href="https://www.basisset.com/">Basis Set</a>, with participation from YC and Caterina Fake&#8217;s Yes Ventures.

Lan at Basis Set told me how she came to lead Snappr&#8217;s A:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>I found Snappr at my then 4-year-old friend Cora's party</strong>. I was surprised that a group of 4-year-olds had a professional photographer taking shots at a random gathering. It turns out that mom Theresa works at Airbnb and had found out about this new company called Snappr, which provides an Airbnb-like experience (Theresa also later invested in the company). The next day, I got a beautifully designed album and a very easy to use intelligent workflow. I was very impressed and reached out to Matt cold.</em></p></blockquote><p>There&#8217;s a lesson in there: <strong>a great consumer product as part of a larger offering can be marketing that pays </strong><em><strong>you</strong></em>.</p><p>Snappr emerged from 2020 with a pile of cash and sitting on a gold mine, with a new twist on a bunch of popular models.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>B2C2PLG</strong></h3><p>Making a product so good that the individual employees inside a company want to use it enough that they push their companies to buy it isn&#8217;t new. It goes by many names: <strong>bottoms-up sales, product-led growth (PLG), B2C2B</strong> (business-to-consumer-to-business). It&#8217;s the model that propelled <strong>Slack, Dropbox, Notion, Figma, and Zoom</strong> to great heights, and as a result, is the model that many, many SaaS companies employ today.&nbsp;</p><p>Putting a structure around listening to product-led customers and turning them into actionable leads in order to grow accounts isn&#8217;t new either: it&#8217;s called <strong><a href="https://www.pocus.com/blog/introducing-product-led-sales">product-led sales</a></strong>. Twilio famously didn&#8217;t think they needed a sales team because of their PLG motion until they lost the Uber account. They quickly learned to turn self-serve leads into sales targets.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Building something internally and then selling it to customers</strong> isn&#8217;t new: it&#8217;s how Amazon ended up with AWS and <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/lithics-new-customer">how Privacy.com ended up launching Lithic</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Consumers pushing their companies to officially use a marketplace product that they use and love as consumers isn&#8217;t new: <strong>Uber for Business</strong> and Airbnb for Business are real things.</p><p>Treating the individuals inside a company as ambassadors for a consumer product isn&#8217;t new: <strong>SeamlessWeb</strong> grew its B2C business as its clients&#8217; employees used it, and shared it, personally (although Not Boring Capital portfolio company <a href="https://sharebite.com/">Sharebite</a> is eating its lunch in the office now).&nbsp;</p><p>These last two shouldn&#8217;t be surprising: businesses are full of consumers, and most consumers work for businesses.

Already, more automation means that Snappr can charge lower prices, opening up the mid-market.&nbsp;</p><p>Five years into the journey, having survived COVID, the launch of Workflows represents a new chapter for Snappr, an opportunity to accelerate already eye-popping growth, and the last piece of a new business model.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Snapping into Focus</strong></h3><p>None of Snappr&#8217;s journey was planned to work out like this, but it&#8217;s working out nicely.&nbsp;</p><p>Let&#8217;s recap:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Snappr launched out of Y Combinator in 2017</p></li><li><p>It&#8217;s raised $13 million and spent a fraction of it</p></li><li><p>It evolved from a graduation photography company to a B2C marketplace for on-demand professional photography to a B2C <em>and</em> B2B marketplace for on-demand professional photography and editing to a <strong>SaaS and visual content infrastructure suite </strong><em><strong>plus </strong></em><strong>B2C </strong><em><strong>and</strong></em><strong> B2B marketplace for on-demand professional photography and editing.</strong></p></li></ul><p>Snappr believes that visual content is the electricity that powers the internet, and that it&#8217;s building the poles and wires.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b61ba1a-3612-400a-adc5-6e9ad59aaf23_922x504.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b61ba1a-3612-400a-adc5-6e9ad59aaf23_922x504.png" width="922" height="504" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7b61ba1a-3612-400a-adc5-6e9ad59aaf23_922x504.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:504,&quot;width&quot;:922,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b61ba1a-3612-400a-adc5-6e9ad59aaf23_922x504.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b61ba1a-3612-400a-adc5-6e9ad59aaf23_922x504.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b61ba1a-3612-400a-adc5-6e9ad59aaf23_922x504.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b61ba1a-3612-400a-adc5-6e9ad59aaf23_922x504.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Snappr Internal Documents</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Less than two years ago, Snappr was only a piece of that yellow box &#8211; sourcing &#8211; and even that was threatened by COVID.

As more of the bar turns red, it means that more of Snappr&#8217;s revenue is sweet, sweet SaaS revenue, and that it&#8217;s improving its margins without needing to extract more take rate from photographers and consumers.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, Snappr has created a model that aligns incentives with its consumer customers and photographers.&nbsp;</p><p>Snappr Shoots is lead gen for Snappr Workflows. The effective LTV of a customer is so much higher than it would be in a traditional marketplace because each consumer comes with some probability of converting to a sticky, high-revenue, high-margin Workflows client. I would imagine that in some business-heavy markets, Snappr could actually subsidize the cost of Shoots well below market rates in order to acquire more Workflows customers. In that case, consumers win, Snappr wins, and Workflows clients, who can consolidate spend and receive a more cohesive product offering, win.&nbsp;</p><p>I always get to this point in the essay, my optimism firing on all cylinders, amazed by what these entrepreneurs have been able to accomplish, and forget to talk about the downsides or risks. In most cases, I don&#8217;t find the downsides that interesting. There&#8217;s that Tolstoy quote from Anna Karenina: &#8220;All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.&#8221; I think it&#8217;s nearly the opposite for startups: &#8220;Nearly all startup risks are alike; each successful startup is successful in its own way.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>Companies face two main types of risk &#8211; <strong>market and execution</strong> &#8211; and if they&#8217;re lucky, a third: <strong>competition</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>For Snappr, the risk is obvious: <strong>execution</strong>.</p><p>Building a marketplace business and operating it at scale is really hard. It&#8217;s hard to keep both sides of the market happy. It&#8217;s hard to maintain quality &#8211; what happens when there&#8217;s so much demand that Snappr needs to drop its quality bar from the top 10% of applicants to the top 20%?&nbsp;</p><p>Building good SaaS and APIs is really hard. Snappr is dealing with huge volumes of big files and thousands of unique client workflows and brand guidelines and quirks. Its DNA is as a marketplace company; success in one doesn&#8217;t guarantee success in the other.</p><p>Growing fast is really hard. There are product challenges and organizational challenges and everything gets complex really fast.&nbsp;</p><p>Building both businesses simultaneously while growing 14% every month, then, is an absurdly difficult challenge.&nbsp;</p><p>The flip side, though, is that if Snappr gets it all right, or gets enough of it right to keep moving and listening to customers and iterating, it has the opportunity to become the infrastructure for visual content.&nbsp;</p><p>Because even though Snappr was born as a marketplace, it has most of the hallmarks of a good <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/apis-all-the-way-down">API-first business</a>. Photos are mission critical to modern digital businesses, but they&#8217;re non-core.

I&#8217;d assume that some of the same thoughts apply to other countries, as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, I said that I don&#8217;t want to stop writing about things I&#8217;m not an expert in just because there are more than 100,000 of you here.

Zero-sum thinking.&nbsp;</p><p>We used to be a country that celebrated the risk-takers and those who achieved success, because their success showed us what was possible for us, too.

We are using tools designed for a linear age in an exponential one. Even tripling wages won&#8217;t make a dent in the gap.&nbsp;</p><p>To win votes, politicians ignore the facts and opt to turn labor against capital, instead of trying to make everyone capital.&nbsp;</p><p>So here&#8217;s my slogan: <strong>American Owned</strong>. (Or Make Americans Owners, or something, we&#8217;re working on it.)</p><p>We need to make America the place where everyone is an owner, and everyone acts like an owner. We need to make it the place where hard work <em>and</em> risk taking are applauded and rewarded.</p><p>The point is this:<strong> we need to stop focusing so much time worrying about protecting peoples&#8217; downsides and start spending more time working on getting more people more upside.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Put another way, there is more relative downside to not participating in upside than there is to the actual downside. As any equity investor will tell you, you can only lose 1x your money, but your upside is uncapped.&nbsp;</p><p>We&#8217;re thinking like a bunch of fixed income investors, worrying about what can go wrong, instead of thinking like venture capitalists, dreaming of what can go right! That needs to change.</p><p>From Main Street to the bleeding edge of the internet, we need to make sure that Americans of all incomes are able to not just work for capital, but to put capital to work for them. We need to protect their digital property rights like their physical ones, and make it easy for them to earn upside in the projects in which they participate.&nbsp;</p><p>Obviously, we need to make sure that people are well-compensated for their labor, that they&#8217;re able to put food on the table, a roof over their heads, an education in their brains, <em>and</em> that they can pay their medical bills without fear of bankruptcy.</p><p>But a person&#8217;s labor can&#8217;t grow exponentially, it can&#8217;t possibly keep up with exponential growth, so we need to make sure that it&#8217;s as easy as possible for Americans to become owners.&nbsp;</p><p>We did it once, with home ownership, and we need to do it again with diversified portfolios of assets that mean that all Americans do well when any of our fellow Americans do really well. (Although redlining and other exclusionary policies and biases made it much easier for some people than others to own homes; that needs to change this time around.) Markets are global, consumer bases are global, potential outcomes are bigger than ever before: we should orient ourselves to ensure that as much ownership as possible ends up in the hands of as many Americans as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>And yes, their pensions or retirement plans might own assets. That&#8217;s great. But this is as much about the <em>feeling</em> of upside as the upside itself. If America can get its swagger back, there&#8217;s no problem we can&#8217;t solve.&nbsp;</p><p>The old America would have treated COVID like a war to win together instead of squabbling over basic facts. The old America would welcome the opportunity to lead the world on climate, recognizing the huge financial and societal upside in doing so. The old America would make damn sure that web3 startups weren&#8217;t domiciling abroad to avoid restrictive regulation. Our country&#8217;s strongest competitor is a bastion of centralized control; we should be using that to our advantage, counter-positioning, and making America the home of democratized ownership.</p><p>We need to push upside and ownership to the edges. People who create value should be rewarded in assets whose value appreciates in-line with the value created. We need to fight capitalism with capitalism, and financialization with hyperfinancialization.&nbsp;</p><p>We can revive the American Dream by <strong>making ownership an explicit economic strategy</strong>.</p><p>The <a href="https://variant.fund/writing/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software">Ownership Economy</a> isn&#8217;t just a nice-to-have; it&#8217;s an imperative. And luckily, it&#8217;s happening. We just need to get out of our own way: web3 regulation, accredited investor rules, onerous registration requirements. All of these need to change to match the modern era.&nbsp;</p><p>But that&#8217;s all a little abstract, and I need to bring a broader audience under the tent. If I&#8217;m playing Presidential candidate here, you know I&#8217;m starting on Main Street.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>withco and the Main Street Dream</strong></h3><p>Why is ownership important?

The most powerful part of the announcement, though, was the founder&#8217;s letter that Kevin wrote: <em><a href="https://with.co/resources/why-be-with-company-recapturing-the-american-dream/">Recapturing the American Dream</a>.</em>&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F254c8ecb-a002-4899-b6aa-278579981b62_1171x495.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F254c8ecb-a002-4899-b6aa-278579981b62_1171x495.png" width="1171" height="495" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/254c8ecb-a002-4899-b6aa-278579981b62_1171x495.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:495,&quot;width&quot;:1171,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F254c8ecb-a002-4899-b6aa-278579981b62_1171x495.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F254c8ecb-a002-4899-b6aa-278579981b62_1171x495.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F254c8ecb-a002-4899-b6aa-278579981b62_1171x495.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F254c8ecb-a002-4899-b6aa-278579981b62_1171x495.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Excerpt from Recapturing the American Dream, Kevin Song, withco</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>I first met Kevin for a drink in New York in 2019. I wanted to leave Breather. Kevin was starting a company. Our mutual friend <a href="https://twitter.com/ejcwalters">Ed Walters</a> thought we should meet. When we did, Kevin told me his parents&#8217; story: entrepreneurs start a small business, grow it, and get it pulled out from under them when the landlord jacks up the rent.&nbsp;</p><p>Rising retail rents are one major factor contributing to a general decline in Main Street small business ownership. In New York, it&#8217;s so brutal that Danny Meyer, who helped transform Union Square from an open air crackhouse into one of the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city, had to move his Union Square Cafe from its original location to a new one a few blocks uptown. Two blocks away, the legendary Coffee Shop was replaced by yet another Chase branch (there are 4,800 nationwide) thanks to rising rents.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16d8ece2-d488-43ce-b6e2-6f59bef75ed2_644x434.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16d8ece2-d488-43ce-b6e2-6f59bef75ed2_644x434.png" width="644" height="434" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/16d8ece2-d488-43ce-b6e2-6f59bef75ed2_644x434.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:434,&quot;width&quot;:644,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16d8ece2-d488-43ce-b6e2-6f59bef75ed2_644x434.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16d8ece2-d488-43ce-b6e2-6f59bef75ed2_644x434.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16d8ece2-d488-43ce-b6e2-6f59bef75ed2_644x434.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16d8ece2-d488-43ce-b6e2-6f59bef75ed2_644x434.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Gothamist, <a href="https://gothamist.com/food/union-square-coffee-shop-now-chase-bank-of-course">Iconic Union Square &#8216;Coffee Shop&#8217; Sign Replaced with a Perfectly Dispiriting Chase Bank Sign</a></em></figcaption></figure></div><p>It&#8217;s a clearly shitty situation.

investor in withco), but his story is a glaring example of an all-too-familiar scenario that plays out over and over, day after day, across the country. <strong>Small business owners create value in a neighborhood, but they don&#8217;t capture most of it</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>withco exists to fix that by making small business owners property owners, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, working with withco doesn&#8217;t guarantee that small business owners will succeed. It doesn&#8217;t make finding customers any easier, or make supplies cost less, or make Amazon and Walmart disappear, or smooth over any of the millions of business-specific things that make running a small business challenging (yet). Owning your own real estate comes with its own set of problems!&nbsp;</p><p>withco simply removes <strong>platform risk</strong> &#8211; the risk that they could get everything right and <em>still</em> get kicked out, gives them full <strong>ownership</strong> of their business, and allows them to capture more of the <strong>upside</strong> if they succeed. It helps <strong>push ownership and upside to the edges</strong>.</p><p>withco is a perfect example to start with here, because the value proposition and societal benefit is so clear. Main Street small business ownership is as American as apple pie. If small business owners can own their space, upside, and destiny, that&#8217;s good.&nbsp;</p><p>When I&#8217;m arguing for things that seem a little more out there in the rest of the piece, think back to withco. It&#8217;s the same idea: let people capture value and potentially upside for their contributions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>We need to use financialization to bring back the American Dream</strong>.</p><h3><strong>The American Dream</strong></h3><p>The American Dream is the belief that anyone in America can achieve success and upward social mobility through hard work.&nbsp;</p><p>It made sense in a more linear era; it no longer makes sense in an exponential one. Even the opening paragraph of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream">American Dream Wikipedia page</a> ends thusly:</p><blockquote><p><em>The American Dream has been questioned by researchers and political spokespeople, arguing that it is a <strong>misplaced belief that contradicts reality in the present-day United States</strong>.</em></p></blockquote><p>That&#8217;s a tragedy.

And according to Housel, gains were shared more equally than ever before. &#8220;The gap between rich and poor narrowed by an extraordinary amount.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>America emerged from the war as <em>the </em>world leader and approached its new role with a confident, aggressive vigor.

Success isn&#8217;t as meritocratic as it used to be and, <strong>when success is granted, is rewarded with higher gains than in previous eras.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>Housel argues that expectations take a long time to change, and that people are still expecting to go back to the way things were in the 1950s, when working hard meant a good house, a good car, and social status. Trump leans into that, and Warren leans into that, but it&#8217;s a fairy tale. There&#8217;s no going back.&nbsp;</p><p>In absolute terms, Housel points out, things are actually pretty good! Unemployment is historically low. Humanity has made an absurd amount of progress in critical areas like healthcare, communication, and transportation. Wages are growing faster for low-income workers than the rich.&nbsp;</p><p>But in possibly humans&#8217; weirdest quirk, <strong>relative success matters more than absolute success.</strong> The gap is still widening. And that last point in the last paragraph, the one about relative wages, is practically meaningless: <strong>rich people don&#8217;t get rich from their wages</strong>. As Karl Marx could have told you nearly two centuries ago, they get rich from their capital.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Saving Sam and Investing Ingrid</strong></h3><p>Let&#8217;s take this super simple example. Say there are two friends, Sam and Ingrid. Sam and Ingrid earn the same wage and each ends up with $10,000 after taxes and paying for all of the things they need to pay for each year. Sam saves that $10,000 under his mattress, Ingrid invests hers in the S&amp;P 500. They&#8217;ve done this for the past 30 years, during which period the S&amp;P 500 has grown at about 10% per year.&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of 30 years, here&#8217;s what the difference looks like:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadf9e748-db69-4448-a2ae-f2e9d9cb1201_568x292.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadf9e748-db69-4448-a2ae-f2e9d9cb1201_568x292.png" width="568" height="292" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/adf9e748-db69-4448-a2ae-f2e9d9cb1201_568x292.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:292,&quot;width&quot;:568,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadf9e748-db69-4448-a2ae-f2e9d9cb1201_568x292.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadf9e748-db69-4448-a2ae-f2e9d9cb1201_568x292.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadf9e748-db69-4448-a2ae-f2e9d9cb1201_568x292.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fadf9e748-db69-4448-a2ae-f2e9d9cb1201_568x292.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>It&#8217;s not even close. Despite the same wage and spending, Sam ends up with a net worth that&#8217;s only 18% as high as Ingrid&#8217;s. Wildly, <strong>Ingrid&#8217;s net worth is in the top 5% of all Americans. Sam&#8217;s is in the bottom 50%.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The Old American Dream would say that if Sam just works harder, he will make more and end up better off than Ingrid.

She ends up with 51x as much money as Sam does. What&#8217;s wilder: over this 30 year period, <strong>even if Sam took home $1 million per year and Ingrid continued to take home $10k &#8211; if Sam made 100x more than Ingrid &#8211; Ingrid would still have more money than Sam at the end of the period!&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Minimum wage increases are important, but they&#8217;re a bandaid. Better jobs are important, but they&#8217;re a band-aid. If we could somehow recreate the post-World War II period and dramatically increase the demand for physical things, and increase the demand and price of labor in-line with that demand, it would only be a band-aid.&nbsp;</p><p>The game has moved on. Consumerism can no longer be the primary economic strategy. The labor market is pretty much maxed out, and the gap isn&#8217;t closing.&nbsp;</p><p>To bring back the American Dream, <strong>America needs to</strong> <strong>make ownership an explicit economic strategy</strong>.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Making Ownership the Explicit Economic Strategy</strong></h3><p>Labor will never catch up with capital. Rising wages are necessary but not sufficient. The gap will keep getting wider.&nbsp;</p><p>Technology accelerates the widening of the gap between the returns to capital and the returns to labor. Successful technology companies can reach global audiences at miniscule marginal costs with dramatic returns to scale. There&#8217;s no putting the genie back in the bottle, and any policy that seeks to do so will just limit upside or push the winners and their money abroad.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, America needs to make ownership an explicit economic strategy. This should be the easiest place in the world for a company to distribute ownership to its stakeholders, and the easiest place in the world for people to capture the value from their contributions. It should be a place where everyone cheers for companies and protocols to be as successful as possible, because their success is our success. It should be a place that leans into and facilitates the financialization of everything.&nbsp;</p><p>Financialization seems like a dirty word, like things are moving in the wrong direction, to a place where all we care about are dollars and not each other. It&#8217;s a little dystopian.&nbsp;</p><p>But when you hit a patch of ice and spin out, you need to turn the wheel in the direction of the spin. When you&#8217;re going around a sharp turn, you accelerate into it.&nbsp;</p><p>Same here. We need to <strong>financialize everything with more granularity</strong>, because everything is <em>already</em> fuzzily financialized. The lack of granularity and ease around financialization just means that everything is financialized in favor of larger players.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>If small business owners don&#8217;t have cash for a down payment, they just need to pay rent to landlords.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>If the value of my raw Spotify data is only $0.20, Spotify can just keep it.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>If there&#8217;s no easy way to track the ownership of my Fortnite skin outside of Fortnite, Epic can keep it.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>If there&#8217;s no easy way for Uber to give me equity for referring people, they just give me a discount and keep the upside.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>The Sam and Ingrid scenario plays out over and over again. People accept things with no upside &#8211; like free services, discounts, or even cash &#8211; for things that companies and more sophisticated investors use to generate upside. The gap widens.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#8217;s like the scene in Office Space where Peter talks about pilfering tiny fractions of a penny that become really big in aggregate:&nbsp;</p><div id="youtube2-yZjCQ3T5yXo" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;yZjCQ3T5yXo&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yZjCQ3T5yXo?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>The lack of granularity and legibility means that all those little fractions of a cent, over billions of people, accrue to the center. And the center invests, turning those cents into dollars. That&#8217;s great, that&#8217;s the trade we&#8217;ve had no choice but to accept, and it&#8217;s exactly what companies are supposed to do.&nbsp;</p><p>Hyperfinancialization done right just means tracking those pennies better and making sure that they end up in the hands of the people who earned them, ideally in the form of ownership. It means that those people can build portfolios of mini-ownership positions where they can generate upside instead of constantly stuffing assets under their mattress, when they receive assets in return for their efforts at all.&nbsp;</p><p>I&#8217;ve made it this far without focusing on web3. That&#8217;s intentional. I care a lot more about people getting ownership and capturing the value they create than I care about how they do it. There&#8217;s a lot to do to increase ownership and upside before even discussing web3.</p><p><strong>withco</strong> is helping small business owners become property owners without a token in sight. We need hundreds of businesses like withco that turn renters into owners.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies like <a href="https://www.onlyalt.com/">Alt</a>, Rally, AngelList, <a href="https://masterworks.art/notboring">Masterworks</a>, and others that I wrote about in <em>Software is Eating the Markets</em> make it easier for people to invest in <strong>alternative assets</strong> that were traditionally only accessible to ultra high net worth investors. <a href="https://www.altoira.com/">AltoIRA</a> lets people invest in those assets with their self-directed retirement funds. More of these please.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Accredited investor rules</strong> need to change. They may have been well-intentioned at some point, but today, they&#8217;re patronizing and destructive.&nbsp;</p><p>It is wild to me that we live in a country in which state governments run lotteries, which have a negative expected value (EV) and have long been called a &#8220;poor tax,&#8221; while the federal government limits who can put their money into positive EV vehicles like venture capital funds. Personally, I would love nothing more than to be able to invest on behalf of thousands of people for whom fund outperformance would be truly meaningful.&nbsp;</p><p>The tax treatment of <strong>employee options</strong> should be much simpler and more employee-friendly. It&#8217;s a travesty that a company&#8217;s lowest paid employees often don&#8217;t have the funds to buy their options within the 90 day window from their departure, or to fund the taxes they might have to pay before seeing a dollar of returns.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>America should be the place where people are rewarded to the maximum extent possible for taking smart risks and, of course, working hard.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>And yes, there&#8217;s web3.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the things that web3 is best at is doing what withco does &#8211; remove platform risk and push ownership and upside to the edges &#8211; on a much wider range of assets and transaction sizes. It makes it possible to reward people with ownership for even microinteractions.&nbsp;</p><p>Take <strong>community ownership</strong>. Most projects reserve over half of their tokens for the users. We discussed some of the benefits last week when we talked about <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/braintrust-fighting-capitalism-with">Braintrust</a>, but the implicit calculation that founders are making here is pretty cool: I think that my tokens will be worth more if I give away half of my ownership to the community. </p><p>Those tokens can incentivize users in ways that mean lower payments to companies like Facebook and Google. Putting tokens in users&#8217; wallets instead of putting dollars through AdWords is a fantastic way to push ownership and upside to the edges.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;But people can buy shares in Facebook and Google,&#8221; you object, smugly. As soon as Facebook and Google give users shares for free just for using their products, as soon as they reward them for the attention that makes their platforms valuable with financial instruments that have upside potential, I will concede that point.&nbsp;</p><p>People should be able to <strong>own and monetize their own data</strong>. They should be rewarded for their attention. They should be able to be rewarded for backing the right projects early, whether with their dollars or their activity, like venture capitalists are.&nbsp;</p><p>This obviously doesn&#8217;t mean that the government should require companies to give ownership for usage. It means that we should put frameworks in place that make it as easy as possible for American companies and protocols to reward users with ownership&nbsp;</p><p>Many companies and protocols are already choosing to do this. As more do, and as some of the messiness of web3 gets abstracted away, consumers should be able to build up a diversified ownership portfolio based on their activities, in the background.</p><p>Often, these portfolios will perform in line with the market. That&#8217;s fine; it means they&#8217;re not being left behind. Occasionally, there will be life-changing or at least year-improving upside outcomes, like getting airdropped Uniswap or ENS tokens. Those gains can be re-invested. They can compound. Everyone can be a little more like Ingrid.</p><p>Of course, sometimes, they&#8217;ll go to zero too. That&#8217;s the market.&nbsp;</p><p>America should treat its citizens like adults and make it as easy as possible for these scenarios to play out.&nbsp;</p><p>There&#8217;s precedent. Home ownership was a big part of the American economic story post WWII and quickly became a cornerstone of the American Dream. Home ownership is great, if not always financially better than renting. Sometimes, peoples&#8217; homes appreciate and make them wealthier than they could have ever imagined. Sometimes, people can&#8217;t keep up with a mortgage and the mortgage wipes them out. The government puts guardrails in place, but it doesn&#8217;t stop people from buying homes. It encourages home ownership, risks and all.&nbsp;</p><p>But home ownership is not enough on its own. You would be hard pressed to find a professional investor with a portfolio that consisted of one asset and a bunch of debt to finance it.&nbsp;</p><p>Professional investors hold portfolios of diversified assets, which gives them better risk-adjusted returns. It should be easy for Americans to do the same &#8211; through a mixture of investment and earned ownership.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, accumulating ownership isn&#8217;t as easy as it should be. There are thousands of entrepreneurs who want to <em>give away </em>ownership in their projects to their users and are told that they can&#8217;t.&nbsp;</p><p>We&#8217;re talking, of course, about DAOs.&nbsp;</p><p>While DAOs are popular and exciting, critics rightly point out that a DAO&#8217;s tokens don&#8217;t confer ownership or a right to profit from the success of the DAO. They&#8217;re just &#8220;governance&#8221; tokens, not securities.&nbsp;</p><p>Let&#8217;s say I wanted to decentralize Not Boring and issue $NB tokens to the most loyal readers. In order to not trip securities law, I could let token holders do things like vote on topics, but I couldn&#8217;t give them ownership rights over any revenue generated through the newsletter. <strong>If I wanted to give away my revenue to readers via tokens, I could not.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Or, and this is a real example, say I wanted to give readers carry in Not Boring Capital via tokens as a sign of my acknowledgment that Not Boring Capital doesn&#8217;t work without them. Nope, can&#8217;t do it. <strong>I wanted to give ownership and upside to thousands of people for free, and was told that doing so would be illegal. </strong>That&#8217;s embarrassing, and it needs to change.&nbsp;</p><p>In web3, American citizenship is actually a detriment.

What&#8217;s going on? Let&#8217;s turn to my friend, <a href="https://twitter.com/bbelldressing">Brett Beller</a>, who&#8217;s both an actual lawyer and a core contributor at <strong><a href="https://fries.fund/">FriesDAO</a></strong>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>Laws surrounding DAOs are actually quite established. While the SEC has brought very few actions against DAOs, <strong>they make it clear that if there is an expectation of profits, that they will consider the token a security</strong>, it is just a matter of them taking action on it. You will notice that any DAO that you place money into will confer you governance over an item/business but not actual ownership rights. Why? Because, in general, ownership of a restaurant, corporation, piece of land or artwork comes with the expectation that if that business were to generate profits or were the item/land to be sold for more than it was purchased for, that profits would be distributed.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Think about that&#8230;<strong>DAOs are FORCED to confer loosely related governance rights instead of real ownership.</strong> As a result a lot of potential businesses formed as DAOs are being stifled and <strong>founders who follow the rules transparently are actually made to appear less trustworthy to the public and DAO token holders as a result</strong>. DAOs are not going away and people will continue to push the boundaries of what is possible under the current laws. <strong>When laws that were meant to protect investors actually provide them with less ownership, while bringing greater confusion and distrust to the marketplace, it is time to consider whether there needs to be a change.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>By attempting to protect peoples&#8217; downside, regulators are leaving the downside wide open while limiting upside and forcing everyone involved to feel like quasi-criminals!&nbsp;</p><p>There are obviously ways to avoid that situation. Every DAO that wants to confer ownership could register its tokens as securities, for example. But that adds mountains of red tape, cost, and friction. It slows down innovation. It makes it more onerous to share upside. And ultimately, it forces many DAOs to register elsewhere, in the Cayman Islands or Switzerland or one of many other countries taking advantage of America&#8217;s antipathy.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;But DAOs are just an example that&#8217;s top of mind. Their challenges are symptomatic of a larger issue &#8211; that we are trying to protect Americans&#8217; downsides instead of maximizing their upsides.&nbsp;</p><p>When we stop a DAO from giving away free ownership to Americans, when we stop someone from investing in a promising startup or alternative asset because they don&#8217;t have $1 million in their bank account already&#8230; we&#8217;re killing the American Dream.&nbsp;</p><p>That&#8217;s not to say that there shouldn&#8217;t be regulation. There should! Historically, America&#8217;s smart and forward-looking regulation is part of what got us here in the first place. We need regulation that once again looks forward, not backward, that treats Americans like pioneers instead of invalids, and that puts more ownership into the hands of more people.&nbsp;</p><p>I have the benefit of being totally ignorant on what it takes to actually make any of what I&#8217;ve written a reality. I&#8217;m ot a politician. I didn&#8217;t study poli sci. I know there are gargantuan challenges and that smart people will rip me apart on the details.&nbsp;</p><p>The biggest hole in my platform &#8211; the biggest missing plank &#8211; is how to get ownership to the people who aren&#8217;t actively looking for it. Li Jin&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1436805502676127749?s=20&amp;t=LMfYkEwQ148KXhUzIOBGvA">Universal Basic Capital</a> is an interesting idea that&#8217;s directionally right: give people upside instead of straight cash. Smarter people than me will need to work to figure that out.&nbsp;</p><p>What I do know is that we&#8217;re never going to climb out of this hole through wage growth or taxes or breaking up big tech.

I&#8217;m not selling anything &#8211; there&#8217;s no tracking link anywhere &#8211; and I&#8217;m not telling you to invest.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#8217;s just that, in Braintrust, I found the perfect vehicle for so many of the arguments I&#8217;ve been trying to put into words.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Brainstrust has a publicly traded token &#8211; BTRST &#8211; so let me yell this as loudly as I can: <strong>THIS IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE</strong>. I mean this. BTRST is worth multiples of what it was when I invested last year. The whole crypto market has been volatile, and BTRST has been more volatile. Not Boring Capital owns BTRST tokens, but I have no idea what the price will do in the next day, week, month, year, or decade.

I like to think about it as <strong>designing economies by setting rules for how tokens are distributed, what participants can do with them, and how value accrues to them</strong>. Tokenomics are one reason tokens have advantages over equities: they can be programmed to do more. OK, back to it.&nbsp;</em></p><p>But even without mentioning a token, the reasons that both sides of the market start using Braintrust are clear:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Enterprises, or <strong>Clients</strong>, use Braintrust because they can find and hire vetted technical and design talent globally quickly for an industry-low 10% fee. They find the right talent for their project in as little as three days instead of many weeks.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Talent</strong> uses Braintrust because they can find high-paying, flexible technical work at top companies like Nike and Porsche and <strong>pay no fee</strong> on what they earn. They can quit their full-time jobs, get as much work as they want, and log off when they want.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>The fact that they can also earn tokens in order to have a vote on the future direction of the network is icing on top, but important icing. <strong>When you trust a platform with your livelihood, you want to make sure it </strong><em><strong>can&#8217;t</strong></em><strong> break that trust.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of being the network&#8217;s raison d&#8217;etre, <strong>web3 is a toolkit that Braintrust uses to do the long-term strategically rational things that all marketplaces </strong><em><strong>should</strong></em><strong> do but that many can&#8217;t</strong> because of incentive and time horizon misalignment, like keeping take rates minimally extractive.&nbsp;</p><p>To be clear, using web3 tools doesn&#8217;t mean that Braintrust is perfect. Tokens aren&#8217;t magic beans. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/ngfrbo/anyone_have_experience_with_braintrust/">This Redditor</a> provides a good first-hand account as a freelancer with both pros and cons. Community governance can be messy and imperfect. Tokens invite people to game or scam the system. I&#8217;m sure there will be many unhappy Clients and Talent over the years.&nbsp;</p><p>Braintrust isn&#8217;t a foregone conclusions, but a series of bets:<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>That good tokenomics can lower costs and unstick and accelerate the flywheel</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>That a user-owned network can stay minimally extractive longer than an investor-owned one</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>That a minimally extractive network can actually be the most valuable</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>That it can eat so much of the global talent market that a small 10% take rate becomes a very big number</strong></p></li></ol><p>It&#8217;s early, but the bets seem to be paying off. Since founding Braintrust in 2018, co-founders <a href="https://twitter.com/adamjacksonsf">Adam Jackson</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gabelunao">Gabriel Luna-Ostaseski</a>, along with the core teams and community, have built Braintrust into one of the most pragmatic and fastest-growing web3 businesses on the planet.&nbsp;</p><p>But there&#8217;s a long way to go to achieve the vision and <strong>pull all talent network business onto its protocol</strong>. Braintrust has done $37 million in volume all-time. Upwork, a Web2 talent network, did $904 million in its <a href="https://investors.upwork.com/static-files/460a7840-cd2d-440d-be9f-eabee2024ee6">last quarter</a> alone, <a href="https://s23.q4cdn.com/749308338/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/Q3_2021_Fiverr-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">Fiverr</a> did ~$260 million. Deloitte did $50.2 billion in revenue in 2021. In all, <strong>companies spend trillions of dollars on talent every year</strong>. In that context, Braintrust&#8217;s volume to date should look like a blip in a year or a decade. And now that Braintrust has gone full DAO, it&#8217;s up to the community to pull it off.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, Braintrust is a familiar business model in one of the oldest businesses in the world &#8211; hiring &#8211; with a few modern enhancements. Its success will be measured by how it competes against public incumbents over time.&nbsp;</p><p>The question for Braintrust is: <strong>can a user-owned network </strong><em><strong>both create and capture</strong></em><strong> more value than its investor-owned counterparts?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>If by the end of this piece, you can understand how the answer might be yes, then you understand web3.</strong> Braintrust is the gateway drug.

I think the AB-5 here in California was complete un-well-thought-out corrupt horseshit just like everything else the state does, but these are market-created problems that markets can solve. <strong>So if you operate a marketplace and half your customers hate you, that&#8217;s an entrepreneur&#8217;s dream.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>So the dream here is: new technology &#8211; blockchain &#8211; powering a new organizational model &#8211; user-owned, user-controlled &#8211; eats away at the central rent seekers who are disproportionately extracting value.</strong> Look, without blockchain, there&#8217;s no way to compete with these guys.

The vacation rental market is bigger because Airbnb exists. Ridesharing is bigger because Uber exists. Done right, marketplaces attract and match new supply and new demand while removing friction and lowering costs. Great stuff. Love Web2 marketplaces.&nbsp;</p><p>But there are also challenges with the model, or opportunities for improvement:&nbsp;</p><p>Like the fact that <strong>marketplaces need to pay a lot to acquire both supply and demand</strong>, often over and over. See: the bloody <strong>Uber v Lyft</strong> battle.&nbsp;</p><p>Or that so many successful <strong>marketplace businesses end up becoming advertising businesses</strong> &#8211; great for the business, annoying for the customer. See: all of the <strong>national fast food chain advertisements</strong> at the top of your DoorDash screen.&nbsp;</p><p>Or that at some point, in order to increase supply, they <strong>drop the quality bar</strong> and people figure out how to game the system and it gets really hard to figure out what&#8217;s good and what&#8217;s not.

I fucking love capitalism.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#8217;s just that, too often, marketplace businesses start extracting earlier than is optimal for the long-term success of the business because they need to prove to shareholders that they <em>can</em> get profitable.

Once it&#8217;s spinning, they need to increase their cut of the economic activity on the platform to generate a return for investors.</p><p>That cut is the <strong>take rate</strong>, which Benchmark&#8217;s Bill Gurley <a href="https://abovethecrowd.com/2013/04/18/a-rake-too-far-optimal-platformpricing-strategy/">defines</a> as, &#8220;The amount that the marketplace charges as a percentage of GMS (gross merchandise sales), which typically represents net revenues for the marketplace.&#8221; The 30% Uber charges drivers, the 30% Apple charges developers, and the 10% that Braintrust charges Clients are all the take rate.&nbsp;</p><p>Increasing the take rate isn&#8217;t bad or immoral or anything.

It&#8217;s helping them find new customers, or lower costs, or do any number of things that would justify paying more. If a marketplace can increase a take rate from 10% to 20% without much attrition, they were either being too generous before, or their product became a whole lot more valuable to its users.&nbsp;</p><p>But &#8220;<strong>without much attrition</strong>&#8221; is doing a lot of work in that last sentence. Whether that attrition shows up today, tomorrow, or in five years, <strong>increasing take rates beyond levels that marketplace participants find fair sows the seeds for a marketplace&#8217;s eventual demise</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8203;&#8203;In a classic April 2013 blog post, <em><a href="https://abovethecrowd.com/2013/04/18/a-rake-too-far-optimal-platformpricing-strategy/">A Rake Too Far: Optimal Platform Pricing Strategy</a>,</em> Gurley wrote about the danger of thinking too short-term when it comes to setting a take rate:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>It may seem tautological that a higher rake is always better &#8211; that charging more would be better than charging less. But in fact, <strong>the opposite may often be true</strong>. The most dangerous strategy for any platform company is to price too high&#8230;</em></p><p><em>If your objective is to build a winner-take-all marketplace over a <strong>very long term</strong>, you want to build a platform that has the least amount of friction (both product and pricing)... <strong>In order for your platform to be the &#8220;definitive&#8221; place to transact, you want industry leading pricing</strong> &#8211; which is impossible if your rake is the de facto cause of excessive pricing.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>The whole piece is worth reading, but the point is this: <strong>increasing take rates feels good in the short-term, but it&#8217;s strategically sub-optimal if you want to build the de facto marketplace long-term. </strong>Increasing take rates can lead supply and demand to look for alternatives.&nbsp;</p><p>When a marketplace charges more than the value it provides, participants will look to <strong>disintermediate</strong>, or go around, the platform.&nbsp;</p><p>This was the challenge that many of the <strong>on-demand cleaning services</strong> faced in the early 2010s.

Clients pay a 10% fee on top of the Talent&#8217;s invoiced amount, which is used to sustain the network. To be fair, the 10% is coming from somewhere &#8211; if the Clients weren&#8217;t paying it, maybe they&#8217;d be willing to pay Talent 10% more &#8211; so the net result is more like a 10% take rate than no fee to Talent and 10% to Clients.&nbsp;</p><p>Importantly, <strong>all payments occur in local currency</strong> &#8211; a US-based Client might pay USD and Braintrust will pay the Talent in their local currency. <strong>It&#8217;s entirely possible to use Braintrust as either a Client or Talent without ever thinking about crypto.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Braintrust can afford to charge such a low take rate for a couple reasons:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Software.</strong> The protocol handles a lot of the basic functions of the marketplace &#8211; matching talent, settling payments, and rewarding participants &#8211; using software at practically zero marginal cost.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Tokens.

Early angel investors and VCs, including Variant, Multicoin, ACME, Hashkey, and more, own 22% of Braintrust&#8217;s tokens on a multi-year lockup and crowdfund purchasers own another 5% on a 3-6 month lockup. In December, Coatue and Tiger bought $100 million worth of tokens from the treasury.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a couple of important questions to flag here, which I&#8217;ll try my best to answer:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p><strong>If VCs invested, is it really user-owned?</strong> This is the <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473139010197508098?s=20&amp;t=HWjhLrArsV2z9kQ_qEYZMg">Jack Paradox</a>: &#8220;You don&#8217;t own web3, the VCs and their LPs do. It will never escape their incentives.&#8221; Now, as a web3 VC who invested in Braintrust, I&#8217;m biased, but a few things:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p>These businesses still need money to get off the ground when they&#8217;re unproven, and that&#8217;s what venture capital is good at doing.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>22% investor ownership, and 41% investor + team ownership, is much less than most businesses have when they go public.</p></li><li><p>Web2 businesses don&#8217;t even have the concept of just giving half of the ownership to the community; the most forward-thinking let their best users buy a small sliver of pre-IPO shares.</p></li><li><p>More pressure comes from who companies IPO <em>to: </em>public market investors are typically much more unforgiving than VCs.&nbsp;</p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Why won&#8217;t VCs make Braintrust do the same things that investors supposedly make web2 marketplaces do? </strong>Most marketplaces feel the pressure to get profitable not from their VCs, but from the public markets. Uber was getting ready to IPO at $120 billion until public market investors called it on lack of profitability and the fact that it didn&#8217;t &#8220;winner-take-all&#8221; its market and therefore couldn&#8217;t increase prices. Web2 companies&#8217; ownership gets more institutional when they exit; web3 companies get more user-owned when they launch their token. Plus, VCs know they won&#8217;t be able to fund web3 companies if they get a reputation for screwing communities. DAOs often vote on which VCs to let on the cap table.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Don&#8217;t Web2 companies have users who own shares too? How is this different? </strong>Let&#8217;s say I own $10k worth of Amazon shares and am an Amazon customer, and let&#8217;s also say that they put the decision to raise Prime prices $10 to a vote (which they wouldn&#8217;t, but play along). That $10 is meaningless to me relative to my shares. If, however, I own $10k of Braintrust and they propose a 10% fee increase, and I make $72k per gig on Braintrust, then the vote will have a $7,200 impact per contract on me. I&#8217;d need to have a really good reason to vote to increase the fee on myself - like the network not being able to survive on 10% fees.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>Plus, the $100 million Coatue round is an interesting example of how investors can dig in and participate in the network. Coatue and Tiger, who have long been investing in web2 marketplaces, reached out to buy more than they could find on exchanges. They came to a deal to buy $100 million of tokens from the Treasury, the proceeds from which will go to fund <a href="https://www.usebraintrust.com/grants">grants</a> (which are paid part in USDC and part in BTRST). As part of the deal, Coatue, which has been acquiring recruiting firms for years, offered to lend the network recruiters in order to build out a recruiter talent network. They&#8217;re actively participating in the network with more than dollars.</p><p>Now, all of this is playing out in real time and whether VCs really won&#8217;t, and more importantly <em>can&#8217;t</em>, push protocols to overly extract will be crucially important to watch.&nbsp;</p><p>Early contributors own 19% of the network. There&#8217;s actually no Braintrust, Inc.; most of the work in building the project was done by six <strong>Nodes</strong> &#8211; Freelance Labs, HexOcean, SnowFork, Accelerated Labs, Distributed Labs, and Muses &#8211; that did everything from designing the protocol and tokenomics to marketing the project early on, and now handle things like processing payments, handling currency conversions, and importantly, onboarding and managing relationships with large clients like Nike and NASA that need a lot of handholding, paperwork, compliance, and security.&nbsp;</p><p>Adam and Gabe, for example, technically work for Freelance Labs, which designed the tokenomics among other things, and the top Client salespeople on the network are a team of three salespeople who set up their own Node.&nbsp;</p><p>Braintrust eats its own dog food, too. <strong>The Braintrust website, including engineering and design, was built entirely by Talent on Braintrust.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>These nodes and early contributors, essentially the founding team split out across multiple organizations, collectively own 19% of tokens. Plus, the 10% that Clients pay goes to pay the Nodes for their ongoing work, who can in turn do things like pay themselves and pay Talent. <em>Hold this thought; we&#8217;ll return to the destiny of that 10% fee shortly.&nbsp;</em></p><p>That leaves the <strong>54% Community Rewards and Incentives Pot</strong>. These are the BTRST tokens the network uses to incentivize good behavior and reward people and businesses for doing things that a traditional marketplace would need to hire for, like referrals, building, and onboarding.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a few main types of contributors who receive Community Incentives and Rewards:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Connectors </strong>are anyone who refers talent or clients to the network. They receive rewards for bringing people into the network, and then receive a portion of their referrals&#8217; invoices. Anyone can become a <a href="https://app.usebraintrust.com/help-center/braintrust-connector-program/category-page/how-do-i-become-a-braintrust-connector">Connector</a> and refer Talent, including individuals like me, professional recruiters, or even recruiting agencies.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Vetters </strong>are people who screen new candidates to ensure that they meet Braintrust&#8217;s quality bar. These people must complete the courses on <a href="https://academy.usebraintrust.com/">Braintrust Academy</a>, for which they receive tokens, and then receive BTRST tokens when they complete screens.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Talent </strong>can receive tokens for filling out detailed profiles, taking courses (mini-learn-to-earn), and successfully completing jobs.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Grant</strong> <strong>Recipients</strong> can receive tokens for doing work for the network in three categories: Ambassador Grants, Builder Grants, and Educator Grants. Braintrust is using the $100 million it recently raised from Coatue and Tiger in part to create a <a href="https://www.usebraintrust.com/grants">Grants Program</a>, which is in its first MVP wave now.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>This illustration from the whitepaper does a good job of laying out how the core marketplace dynamics work end-to-end, smoothed by BTRST tokens (anywhere you see the logo on the graphic):&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F418ec72a-e2c3-4ee7-aa6f-78c413bdf15c_806x802.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F418ec72a-e2c3-4ee7-aa6f-78c413bdf15c_806x802.png" width="806" height="802" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/418ec72a-e2c3-4ee7-aa6f-78c413bdf15c_806x802.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:802,&quot;width&quot;:806,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F418ec72a-e2c3-4ee7-aa6f-78c413bdf15c_806x802.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F418ec72a-e2c3-4ee7-aa6f-78c413bdf15c_806x802.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F418ec72a-e2c3-4ee7-aa6f-78c413bdf15c_806x802.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F418ec72a-e2c3-4ee7-aa6f-78c413bdf15c_806x802.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Braintrust Whitepaper</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Anywhere there&#8217;s a &#8220;$&#8221; sign, that&#8217;s the Client and Talent interacting just like they would on a traditional marketplace, exchanging work for cash.&nbsp;</p><p>Anywhere there&#8217;s a Braintrust logo is where the magic happens:</p><ul><li><p>That&#8217;s where Talent is getting a little extra compared to what they normally would &#8211; the <strong>negative take rate</strong> &#8211; for getting approved or earning a five-star review.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>That&#8217;s where Connectors get rewarded for bringing supply and demand into the network &#8211; customer acquisition costs kill marketplaces; <strong>Brainstrust doesn&#8217;t pay acquisition costs, just tokens</strong>.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>That last point is important and nuanced. <strong>Braintrust doesn&#8217;t pay customer acquisition costs in cash, but it does pay them in tokens. That increases circulating supply.</strong> As long as Connectors are willing to accept BTRST tokens for their referrals, the system works; but increase circulating supply too much, too fast, the tokens become worthless, and Connectors stop connecting. It&#8217;s a delicate balance.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>There is no free lunch here</strong>. Things that are good for the network inflate the circulating supply, which may be bad for token holders. If you&#8217;re a token holder who operates in the network, that&#8217;s fine: you&#8217;re OK with dilution if it means a lower take on your economic activity. If you&#8217;re a purely financial investor, that&#8217;s not as great. The float of tokens is going to double in the coming years, not to mention the investor lockups that are going to roll off. But there is a 250 million token cap that Braintrust can never exceed. A financial investor needs to take a very long-term view to believe that when the dust settles, keeping take rates low using token inflation will lead to a more valuable network long-term.</p><p>That seems like a bug, but <strong>it&#8217;s a feature: Braintrust should get the owners it deserves</strong>. As more of the Community tokens are issued, there will come a point when the network is majority user-owned; until then, it&#8217;s owned by users and contributors, in addition to investors who need to buy into the very long-term vision.</p><p>I want to call this out: <em><strong>this is a key reason Braintrust can charge such a low cash take rate and sustain.</strong></em> It&#8217;s filling in the gaps with tokens that it&#8217;s planned to issue all along. Token holders likely expect those tokens to be directly financially valuable over time, but in the interim, they&#8217;re indirectly financially valuable to network participants, in three ways:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p><strong>Governance.</strong> This is the most important. Governance has financial value here because it might mean the difference between paying higher fees or not, or even keeping the network alive or not. At some point, if the token value drops and the network is more reliant on fees, participants may decide it&#8217;s actually in their best interest to pay higher (but still minimally extractive) fees in order to fund the network with cash.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bid Staking. </strong>Clients and Talent can stake BTRST to stand out to the other party and prove that they&#8217;re serious; if an applicant no-shows an interview, for example, they lose their tokens. This is the web3 replacement for the advertising models that web2 marketplaces graduate to.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Career Benefits. </strong>This one is a little hand-wavey for now, but the Braintrust website hints at future benefits for token holders; these might be things like educational content, free software, or coaching.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>Here&#8217;s another important callout that is very different from equities: <strong>tokens should be more valuable to network participants than they are to purely financial holders.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I&#8217;d never thought of it this way before, but that should be part of the definition of well-designed tokenomics. It&#8217;s so important that I&#8217;ll say it again:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tokens should be more valuable to network participants than they are to purely financial holders.&nbsp;</strong></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fac05b3-ea8c-4344-96aa-d02eb635ed2c_263x172.gif"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fac05b3-ea8c-4344-96aa-d02eb635ed2c_263x172.gif" width="320" height="209.27756653992395" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0fac05b3-ea8c-4344-96aa-d02eb635ed2c_263x172.gif&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:172,&quot;width&quot;:263,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fac05b3-ea8c-4344-96aa-d02eb635ed2c_263x172.gif 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fac05b3-ea8c-4344-96aa-d02eb635ed2c_263x172.gif 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fac05b3-ea8c-4344-96aa-d02eb635ed2c_263x172.gif 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fac05b3-ea8c-4344-96aa-d02eb635ed2c_263x172.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Let&#8217;s do a quick example.</p><p>If you&#8217;re purely an investor, one BTRST token is worth $3.60 at the time of writing.&nbsp;</p><p>But if you&#8217;re Talent on Braintrust, and bid staking that token means that you&#8217;re 0.01% more likely to land a $72,000 job, <strong>it&#8217;s worth $3.60 + $7.20, or $10.80 to you</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>These numbers are made up, and this doesn&#8217;t take into account whether you were likely to get another job if you didn&#8217;t get this one, but regardless of the numbers, I think the logic stands. And I think <strong>it&#8217;s one key way that a user-owned network can outperform a purely investor-owned one: by giving away something that&#8217;s more valuable to recipients than it is to anyone else.</strong></p><p><strong>PLUS</strong>, if the tokenomics are <em>really</em> well-designed they should probably incentivize purely financial holders to get involved in building out the network in some way. For example, I own BTRST tokens but I&#8217;m not looking for work or talent on the network, so I&#8217;m leaking value. Should I be referring Talent to the network, bid staking for them to help them build their reputation, and earning upside as they succeed?&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, I&#8217;m thinking out loud and getting off track, but there&#8217;s this: those tokens must have been worth something to somebody apart from an ownership stake in the network, because <strong>until very recently, the token and network growth actually weren&#8217;t directly connected.</strong></p><h3><strong>Value Accrual and the Protocol Upgrade</strong></h3><p>Remember how in the last section, I said that the Nodes received the 10% fees in cash for their contributions to the network?

You can go through and search by Client to see how much they paid, when, and for what jobs. Adam tells me that there&#8217;s a Twitter bot coming that will tweet things like &#8220;Nike just paid an invoice for $1,000, bought 300 BTRST tokens, going to the DAO.&#8221; Wild.&nbsp;</p><p>The long and short of it is that now, there&#8217;s a direct link between the token price and network volume. More volume creates more demand for the token. As the network grows, there will be more fees to buy more tokens from the open market.&nbsp;</p><p>Importantly, <strong>this doesn&#8217;t rely on profits, just fees</strong>. Network participants, who also own the tokens, are rewarded in tokens that should get more valuable with more fee volume. Braintrust doesn&#8217;t rely on any ponzinomics. It takes in exogenous capital from some of the deepest-pocketed clients in the world, uses those fees to buy back BTRST tokens, and uses those tokens to incentivize behavior that grows the network, bringing in more fees, and kicking it back off.&nbsp;</p><p>If the need to issue tokens as rewards outstrips token buybacks, Braintrust will still pay out of the treasury, but if they&#8217;ve designed the system right, that means they&#8217;re only increasing the circulating supply when participants are doing what the network wants them to do even beyond what client fees can afford to pay down.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#8217;s like if Uber took its ~30% take rate to automatically buyback UBER shares and then used those shares, plus a pot they&#8217;d set aside, to give to people who bring in new riders and drivers. That sounds a lot more sustainable, attractive, and loyalty-inducing than the status quo.&nbsp;</p><p>And it&#8217;s another reason that a user-owned network can win.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>The Braintrust Thesis &amp; How User-Owned Networks Win</strong></h3><p>Braintrust&#8217;s thesis is simple:<strong> the least extractive networks will win, and user-owned networks are more likely to be less extractive.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>To be clear, this doesn&#8217;t mean that web3 marketplaces are <em>guaranteed</em> to win &#8211; they still need to provide a great product and do all of the hard things it takes to run a marketplace &#8211; or that all web2 marketplaces will be overtaken by web3 competitors any time soon.</p><p>On <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0eQbmnI3M3RQdR3sEc21sI?si=ZbZSNkedQYiKdKjNClvAVQ&amp;nd=1">Means of Creation</a></em> with Li Jin and Nathan Baschez, Adam explained his view on which incumbents web3 marketplaces would topple first.

I think there are a couple missing dimensions here, something like product complexity and average order value, that explains why we haven&#8217;t seen decentralized Ubers or DoorDashes quite yet, but that the point is valid.</p><p>On the other hand, he thinks it&#8217;s going to be a very long time before a web3 competitor successfully competes with Airbnb because of how much value Airbnb brings both sides of the marketplace and the reasonable fees it charges (despite all of the hidden fee memes). He actually thinks platforms like Facebook and Twitter aren&#8217;t good targets for web3 because they don&#8217;t charge anything.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#8217;s interesting to note that Airbnb, Adam&#8217;s least extractive, is the most valuable of the newer web2 marketplaces by market cap, the only one without a formidable direct competitor (although hotels formidable competitors in aggregate), and the one that many people argue has the strongest network effects of any web3 marketplace.&nbsp;</p><p>Braintrust is making the same foundational bet that Airbnb seems to be &#8211; <strong>that the least extractive networks can consolidate the space in which they operate and become the most valuable long-term</strong> &#8211; and guaranteeing it in code.</p><p>That bet doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that tokens need to be involved.

"Your margin is my opportunity" is easy to tweet, hard to do. Bezos had to stare down investors for years.

User-owned networks can make pro-customer decisions, which end up better long-term, more easily, because customers are owners.</a><a href="https://twitter.com/packyM/status/1487485079853088774" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-footer"><p class="tweet-date">January 29th 2022</p><span class="retweets"><span class="rt-count">10</span> Retweets</span><span class="likes"><span class="like-count">118</span> Likes</span></div></a></div><p>Who&#8217;s more customer-obsessed than the customers themselves?&nbsp;</p><p>So back to our original question: <strong>can a user-owned network </strong><em><strong>both create and capture</strong></em><strong> more value than its investor-owned counterparts?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>First, the <strong>value creation</strong> side.</p><p>According to Gurley, Bezos, and Chesky, the marketplaces that can stay the least extractive for the longest amount of time can consolidate the financial activity in their space and create the most value long-term.&nbsp;</p><p>Because Braintrust relies on a protocol for things that humans might do in a normal marketplace, and because it can pay for work that other marketplaces would need to use cash for with tokens, it can keep fees lower (but will need to make it up by giving away ownership). Giving away ownership might actually create more long-term value, because those owners benefit from lower take rates, often more than they&#8217;re incentivized by a higher token price, they&#8217;ll likely vote to keep take rates lower, longer.&nbsp;</p><p>That should mean more growth, which will mean more fees in aggregate, and more fees can pay for more improvements, and potentially even <em>lower</em> fees on Clients, which will help Braintrust capture more of the market.&nbsp;</p><p>Matching Talent with Clients, and taking as little of the transaction as possible, creates real economic value. Making it easier and more financially attractive to bothe find and hire flexible work should expand the freelance market and make it easier for people to do exactly the jobs they want, when they want, and for companies to hire for the work they need, when they need.</p><p>I think the answer to the value creation question, as long as Braintrust&#8217;s current trends persist, is a <strong>yes</strong>.</p><p>But at some point, every marketplace wants to turn from attract to extract. Even Amazon. Amazon&#8217;s third-party seller marketplace is a bit of a mess and its huge advertising business, while one of the most underrated business stories in the world, makes it harder to find the actual best thing for you.&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, the point of consolidating the market is that at some point, even if it&#8217;s very far in the future, it should make it easier to capture the value you&#8217;ve spent years creating. If your business is valued on the present value of future cash flows, you need to show investors that there are enormous cash flows sitting out there in the future that you&#8217;re buying with a low take rate today.&nbsp;</p><p>But what if you&#8217;re not valued in the same way?&nbsp;</p><p>This is where Braintrust&#8217;s tokenomics come in, and why I think that Braintrust token holders will be able to <strong>capture the value the network creates</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Equity prices are based on the present value of future cash flows because that&#8217;s what they confer rights to, ultimately. You can&#8217;t use Airbnb shares to get free stays or pay a lower fee as a host. You use Airbnb shares to own a percentage of the business, and to vote.&nbsp;</p><p>But <strong>BTRST tokens offer both ownership </strong><em><strong>and</strong></em><strong> utility</strong>. And for network participants, that utility has real, measurable financial value.</p><p>So what&#8217;s that ownership and utility worth?&nbsp;</p><p>This is why it&#8217;s important to consolidate as much economic activity as possible on the network. Let&#8217;s do a quick <strong>reductio ad absurdum</strong>: what if Braintrust eats the whole talent market?&nbsp;</p><p>According to HBR, <strong>the size of the US staffing and recruiting industry was $151 billion in 2019</strong>. The three largest agencies globally by revenue do a combined $70 billion in annual revenue, roughly one-third of which originated in the US. So let&#8217;s triple that $151 billion and assume, for our sake, that the <strong>global staffing and recruiting industry is about $450 billion</strong>. Then there are the consulting firms like Tata Consulting Services (TCS), Deloitte, PWC, and the likes. Deloitte did $50.1 billion in 2021 revenue, TCS did $22 billion.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Let&#8217;s round the whole thing up to $1 trillion between recruiting/staffing and consulting</strong> &#8211; it&#8217;s way short of the total available pie since we&#8217;re really talking about all knowledge worker wages globally &#8211; but for our math here, it works.</p><p>Braintrust charges companies 10% of whatever they pay people they hire from the platform. So theoretically, if Braintrust could build a machine that consolidated the global flexible talent market over time, <strong>its opportunity would be $100 billion in fees per year</strong>. That&#8217;s a big TAM, and it&#8217;s one that Braintrust believes will grow as it becomes easier for people to find flexible opportunities. <strong>It cites a $5.3 trillion annual spend in tech alone</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Either way, at $100 billion in fees, that would create $100 billion in demand for 250 million total Braintrust tokens from fees alone, plus the demand from all of those network participants who would be able to gain real financial benefit from using those tokens to stand out in such an active marketplace. And then there&#8217;s the governance: how valuable would it be to govern a network that pulls in $100 billion in fees per year and controls the global flexible talent marketplace?&nbsp;</p><p>All to say, that is an absurd scenario and a very long way away in the most optimistic case, but there are many ways for the token to capture the value the network creates without raising the take rate.</p><p>But for now, we&#8217;re still talking about an 18-month-old market that&#8217;s done $37 million in total Gross Service Volume and only serves a small segment: engineers, designers, and product people looking for flexible work at large companies. A lot will need to happen for any of this theoretical stuff to even matter.&nbsp;</p><p>To that end, in the coming months, expect to see projects emerge from the community that aim to move upmarket and downmarket to eat more of the whole flexible talent pie.&nbsp;</p><p>Upmarket, one recent IT Consulting exile is working on a proposal for a Node &#8211; essentially a new startup built on the Braintrust protocol, funded by grants &#8211; to go after the giants like Deloitte, PWC, and Accenture. By warehousing talent and charging hidden markups, these consulting firms can often pull in 70% take rates.</p><p>Downmarket, expect to see similar proposals that go after lower-contract-value talent marketplaces like Fiverr and Upwork.</p><p>At a certain size, it might also make sense to offer services and resources that the newly freelance Talent population might need, like group health insurance or 401ks. That&#8217;s an opportunity to increase economic activity while driving clear value to the network.&nbsp;</p><p>In either case, new Nodes will benefit from the infrastructure, community, and resources that the Braintrust network has built up over the past four years. They won&#8217;t need to raise money to fund tokenomics, protocol design, and smart contract audits, because those will have been done. They&#8217;ll tap into an existing pool of Connectors and Vetters. They won&#8217;t need to raise venture capital because they&#8217;ll be able to get grants from the treasury.&nbsp;</p><p>There will be challenges, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Like the time when Braintrust&#8217;s token launched on Coinbase and traded up to above $40, and armies of bots &#8220;watched&#8221; the short videos in the Braintrust Academy library in order to pick up the BTRST tokens Braintrust offered to incentivize people to learn more about the network. When incentives are baked into everything and backed with a token, you need to be particularly careful about how you design your incentives.&nbsp;</p><p>Or the fact that a bigger, more dispersed community makes governance challenging. It&#8217;s challenging enough already. When I asked Adam what he&#8217;d most disagreed with the community on, he replied quickly:&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;Oh, <strong>so many things</strong>. I think that some of the proposals are just ineffective. But this isn&#8217;t mine anymore. We gave up control in September.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>That&#8217;s the beauty of this. Good or bad, it&#8217;s up to the users who own the network to govern the network.

Last week, we crossed a big, round milestone: our little Not Boring family is now 100,000 strong. </p><p>While I&#8217;ve been excited about the small victory, I&#8217;ve also noticed something new: a voice in the back of my mind asking me what the cynics and trolls are going to think of what I write.</p><p>If having more subscribers and followers means that I get more cautious in what I write, this whole thing falls apart, or at least gets a lot less fun. I want to be able to take risks, write about things that are more complex than I could possibly comprehend but try anyway, make wild predictions that are likely to be wrong but make you (and me) think, and explain businesses that I find fascinating regardless of whether I think their price will go up.&nbsp;</p><p>The opportunity to be misunderstood grows with every new person who joins Not Boring, so I want to take this milestone opportunity to be clear: I&#8217;m going to get a lot of things wrong, there&#8217;s no correlation between audience size and intelligence (I&#8217;m the same idiot today I was when 400 people read this), and if I stop getting things wrong, we can all go home.&nbsp;</p><p>I&#8217;m writing this to get that voice out of the back of my head so that I can take bigger swings and be even more wrong in the next two years than I have been in the first two. Consider this my auto-reply to the trolls.</p><p>Let&#8217;s get to it.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>The 100,000 Foot View</strong></h1><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F296153cb-4a84-4a47-8166-e27781e4edf6_1199x600.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F296153cb-4a84-4a47-8166-e27781e4edf6_1199x600.png" width="1199" height="600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/296153cb-4a84-4a47-8166-e27781e4edf6_1199x600.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:600,&quot;width&quot;:1199,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:899467,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F296153cb-4a84-4a47-8166-e27781e4edf6_1199x600.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F296153cb-4a84-4a47-8166-e27781e4edf6_1199x600.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F296153cb-4a84-4a47-8166-e27781e4edf6_1199x600.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F296153cb-4a84-4a47-8166-e27781e4edf6_1199x600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>On Thursday, we hit a milestone that wasn&#8217;t even in the realm of possibility when I started writing this newsletter in April 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic: <strong>100,000 subscribers</strong>.</p><p>That is an absurd amount of people.

Of course, not everyone reads every email &#8211; open rates have been hovering between 50-54% &#8211; so to torture the analogy, a little under half of the people in the stadium would be asleep, but still&#8230; holy shit.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>THANK YOU!</strong></p><p>None of this makes any sense. I&#8217;m not an expert on any of the topics I write about. Getting here was not a foregone conclusion, or even a goal, when I started writing. I just wanted to explore the things I was curious about. When I started hitting send on newsletters, I thought all of my friends were talking shit about me in a group chat.&nbsp;</p><p>I won&#8217;t go over the whole story again here. If you&#8217;re newer here and want to get the backstory, you can read <em><a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/a-not-boring-adventure-one-year-in">A Not Boring Adventure One Year In</a></em> or listen to the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CrdQYgMrcoL0KjmQyIYVm?si=b28ac1681ad14dda">Not Boring Acquired Episode</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Long story short: I&#8217;ve had a charmed ascent.&nbsp;</p><p>I get to do the two things I would have wanted to do if I were retired &#8211; write and invest. I&#8217;ve gotten to meet a lot of my tech and business heroes. And for the most part, people have been really nice.&nbsp;</p><p>I&#8217;d heard that once you get more than 10,000 Twitter followers, the experience gets toxic and negative. I didn&#8217;t have that experience. We made it all the way to 100,000. The <em><a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game">Great Online Game</a></em> has been really good to me.&nbsp;</p><p>With all the good, I&#8217;ve also noticed something turn over the past month or so, as we approached 100,000. Friends aren&#8217;t talking shit in a group chat (as far as I know), but strangers have been talking more shit on the internet. There&#8217;s more trolling and negativity than there was before. </p><p>Admittedly, I brought some of it on myself. </p><p>Every week, I write about topics and industries that other people spend their whole lives working on. I get things wrong. I started an asynchronous debate with a very popular marketer, which drew the ire of some of his fans, and wrote a sponsored post on a public company, which got a bunch of pseudonymous accounts on fintwit riled up. I&#8217;ll keep pushing boundaries, within the bounds of what is legal and ethical, and listen when you push back constructively.&nbsp;</p><p>But some of it just comes with the territory. </p><p>More followers and subscribers means:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>There&#8217;s a higher ROI to dunking on me.</strong> More people will see the dunks in my replies or comments, and there&#8217;s more to be gained by taking me down. As AppliedDivinityStudies <a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/bounties/">wrote last week</a>, &#8220;By criticizing someone more prominent than yourself, you sap their life force, attempt to take their reputation for your own, and challenge their high standing.&#8221; Damn.</p><p><strong>The things that I tweet and write get outside of the circle of people who have context on Not Boring more quickly.</strong> It&#8217;s a very weird feeling. There was no point on this graph where I felt that I got any smarter or that my word became bulletproof, where I switched from &#8220;I&#8217;m just learning this out loud&#8221; to &#8220;accept this text as Gospel,&#8221; but there&#8217;s a point on here after which new people reading Not Boring for the first time probably think I think I&#8217;m more right than I am. There&#8217;s missing context.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe89c2162-5bd6-4947-891d-8adbe0280933_748x299.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe89c2162-5bd6-4947-891d-8adbe0280933_748x299.png" width="748" height="299" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e89c2162-5bd6-4947-891d-8adbe0280933_748x299.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:299,&quot;width&quot;:748,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe89c2162-5bd6-4947-891d-8adbe0280933_748x299.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe89c2162-5bd6-4947-891d-8adbe0280933_748x299.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe89c2162-5bd6-4947-891d-8adbe0280933_748x299.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe89c2162-5bd6-4947-891d-8adbe0280933_748x299.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>An essay will read differently to someone who&#8217;s read a lot of Not Boring essays than someone who&#8217;s coming in fresh, like this person&#8230;&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a0ce320-7d1f-4098-b81a-85885fc6d909_580x136.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a0ce320-7d1f-4098-b81a-85885fc6d909_580x136.png" width="580" height="136" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9a0ce320-7d1f-4098-b81a-85885fc6d909_580x136.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:136,&quot;width&quot;:580,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a0ce320-7d1f-4098-b81a-85885fc6d909_580x136.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a0ce320-7d1f-4098-b81a-85885fc6d909_580x136.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a0ce320-7d1f-4098-b81a-85885fc6d909_580x136.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a0ce320-7d1f-4098-b81a-85885fc6d909_580x136.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Just one comment that came in while writing this piece</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Even the most stoic person would read that comment and feel a momentary displeasure, and I&#8217;m not the most stoic person.

That they tweeted like fortune cookies because they believed their pithy thoughts were profound and worthy of thousands of likes.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, I&#8217;ve come to realize that the real point is that as peoples&#8217; audiences grow, the risk of being misunderstood or running into trolls grows exponentially, to the point that the safest move is to just tweet or write dumb, simple shit, stop experimenting, stop taking risks, and avoid controversy above all else. <strong>Pander to the lowest common denominator</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>So people either retreat to simplified, dumbed down versions of their thing, or they go full heel turn, embracing and feeding off of the hate. That sounds kind of fun for the right kind of person, but it doesn&#8217;t work for me.&nbsp;</p><p>Another is to own it. I was going to write a whole piece expanding on the last few paragraphs about how strange it feels to go from being nobody one day to &#8211; after working non-stop for two years &#8211; being somebody people like dunking on.&nbsp;</p><p>But then I realized:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p>This is the greatest job in the world.</p></li><li><p>I have fun writing what I write.</p></li><li><p>If you had told me this would be the situation I&#8217;d be in two years ago, I would have laughed.</p></li></ol><p>This is the first time I&#8217;ve had to deal with consistent trolling, and now that it&#8217;s here, it&#8217;s probably going to be here for as long as I continue to do this. So I&#8217;m going to do a couple things:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p><strong>Appreciate that two years ago, I would have loved to have even a single troll.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Recommit to the things that the 99.9% of non-trolls reading this are here for.</strong></p></li></ol><p><strong>Not Boring is for the optimists, and for the skeptics who are willing to keep an open-mind</strong>. It&#8217;s not for the perma-cynics. They&#8217;ll always find something to bash. That&#8217;s OK.&nbsp;</p><p>I&#8217;ll <strong>remind you at every opportunity that I&#8217;m an idiot</strong>. I often write, &#8220;<strong>This is not investment advice</strong>,&#8221; and I know that&#8217;s a form disclosure that people have to write even when they don&#8217;t mean it just to avoid getting in trouble, but I legitimately mean it. I&#8217;m not a very good trader. I fall in love with my positions. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m drawn to VC &#8211; where the holding periods are many years &#8211; instead of a trading desk. Plus, I don&#8217;t write how I&#8217;m sizing investments, expose my whole portfolio to show how a certain asset fits within it, or write follow-ups to say, &#8220;Hey I sold this position,&#8221; all things I&#8217;d expect of someone from whom I was actually taking investment advice.&nbsp;</p><p>I&#8217;ll try to <strong>keep it positive, </strong>but I also <strong>won&#8217;t shy away from mixing it up with people who I think are dunking on others for their own personal gain or bending the facts to fit their own narrative</strong>, <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/the-web3-debate">like I did last week</a>. There&#8217;s a difference between positive and meek. I&#8217;ll call out scammers, but I&#8217;ll never knock people who are building something they think is important in good faith.&nbsp;</p><p>I&#8217;ll continue to write and invest and work with sponsors to tell their stories in one big mix. I&#8217;m a firm believer in &#8220;<strong>no conflict, no interest</strong>.&#8221; Everyone has incentives, mine are just more clear. I&#8217;m always going to be conflicted and biased; my promise is to disclose my incentives more clearly than anyone else, to never write about things I&#8217;m not genuinely excited about, and to always be fair and honest. </p><p>Sponsored, invested, or not, I&#8217;ll always write about the things that I&#8217;m most curious about, where <strong>the delta between my current understanding and my desired understanding is the widest</strong>. I want to <strong>explain complex but important topics as simply and approachably as possible</strong>. That means that I&#8217;ll often get things wrong, or miss important pieces of the story. If I get everything right, it means that I&#8217;m leaning too heavily on comfortable or easily understood topics.&nbsp;</p><p>I&#8217;m lucky that there are 100,000+ of you smart, curious people who want to explore with me. Please don&#8217;t take what I write as the final word. If you&#8217;re interested in a topic I write about, use my piece as a starting point. The best way to approach Not Boring is to <strong>learn </strong><em><strong>with</strong></em><strong> me, not </strong><em><strong>from</strong></em><strong> me</strong>, and then go off on your own learning adventure.&nbsp;</p><p>This is going to be a particularly interesting time &#8211; the <strong>first bear market in Not Boring&#8217;s young life</strong>. I&#8217;m almost certainly going to write positive pieces about companies and projects whose prices will proceed to tank 10% on the very same day. Trolls are going to skewer me, I&#8217;m going to hurt for a second, stew, formulate a witty response, delete it, move on, and hopefully appreciate the absurdity of the fact that that&#8217;s all part of my job.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>My worst call ever &#8211; <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/bill-a-bear">short Bill.com</a> &#8211; is a great reminder that I don&#8217;t play the bear very well. It&#8217;s not who I am, and there are plenty of bears out there. You should <strong>read Not Boring for the optimist-leaning analysis (I only write about things I&#8217;m excited about) and then read other people who are better bears to form a full picture.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>But before we get to whatever&#8217;s next, I want to take this opportunity to pause and let you know how much I appreciate that you let me do this for a living. Thanks for being one of the first 100,000. As web3 people are fond of saying, <strong>we are still so early</strong>.</p><p>In a decade, <strong>there will be more than a million of us smart, curious Not Boring people</strong>. The closer we get, the funnier it will be that that many people read the things that I write. I promise to get things spectacularly wrong, get dunked on, shake it off, and continue exploring and learning. I don&#8217;t think my skin will get any thicker, it hasn&#8217;t yet, but maybe I&#8217;ll read back on this and remember that I knew it was coming and that I signed up for it.</p><p>No matter what happens, <strong>I won&#8217;t start writing fortune cookies</strong>. You&#8217;re too smart for that. If you catch me doing it, you have my permission to troll, dunk on, and eviscerate me.&nbsp;</p><p>The world is only going to get crazier and faster and more complex. I&#8217;m going to do my best to keep up and translate the incredible things people build into words. </p><p>Viva the Optimists.</p><div><hr></div><p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/bbelldressing">Brett</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/puja-bhatt-9062ba65/">Puja</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/damccormick13">Dan</a> for editing! </em></p><div><hr></div><p>How did you like this week&#8217;s Not Boring?

I don&#8217;t subscribe. But my dad forwarded it to me, with an &#8220;uh oh&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>Uh oh is right. I should have been nervous about opening it. I&#8217;m very long crypto. But I wasn&#8217;t even a little bit nervous, because I had no doubt what side the Prof would be on and what kind of piece he was going to write. And that&#8217;s exactly the piece he wrote.</p><p>Now I don&#8217;t want this to be a &#8220;dunk on the Prof because he&#8217;s always wrong&#8221; piece. My friend and<a href="https://partyround.com/"> Party Round</a> CEO Jordi Hays proclaimed that &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/jordihays/status/1470104945256919042?s=20">shitting on Galloway is played out</a>,&#8221; and I tend to agree. I didn&#8217;t even want to respond.&nbsp;</p><p>But then I noticed that he misquoted me and misrepresented things I was involved in. Then I looked a little deeper and found errors and misdirections galore.&nbsp;</p><p>The Professor&#8217;s piece was a lazy regurgitation of other peoples&#8217; arguments with some key inaccuracies, intentional or accidental. Hundreds of thousands of people read, listen to, and even pay to learn from him, and normally it&#8217;s not my problem&#8230; but if he&#8217;s going to accidentally pull me into this debate anyway, let&#8217;s debate.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Welcome to Debate Club</strong></h3><p>At the risk of making myself seem unimaginably cool: I debated competitively in high school and college, and actually just started a Debate Club in NYC when COVID hit.&nbsp;</p><p>In Parliamentary debate, the kind we did at Debate Club, there are two teams &#8211; the Proposition and the Opposition &#8211; who debate a <strong>resolution</strong>. The resolution might be something like &#8220;General AI should have fundamental rights.&#8221; The Proposition defends the resolution and the Opposition tries to poke holes in it.&nbsp;</p><p>The two sides go back and forth making arguments, concluding in a <strong>rebuttal</strong> from each team summarizing the debate, reiterating their points, and trying to make clear why their side won. If you want to read the rules, I wrote up a <a href="https://packym.notion.site/Debate-Club-Rules-1ab89bab36cc46118b9c4ba5ebab62d2">stripped down version for Debate Club</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a few things that you want to do to win a debate.&nbsp;</p><p>The most obvious is that you want to <strong>find the most and best evidence in favor of your side</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>In the course of your research, you will also find evidence that contradicts your side. Be aware of this evidence in case you need to defend against it, but by all means, don&#8217;t to bring it up (unless, of course, you&#8217;re playing an advanced game and want to say things like &#8220;I expect that our opponents will tell you that x, y, z&#8230; they&#8217;re wrong because a, b, c.&#8221;). Less scrupulous debaters might even bend or make things up.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember, the point in a debate is to <strong>win</strong>, not to get to the truth.</p><p>That&#8217;s Debate 101 type stuff. And then there&#8217;s the more advanced shit: <strong>instead of fighting the battle you were assigned, you start a new battle about whatever serves your agenda.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>An experienced debater will spend a good chunk of her time setting the definitions. Take our General AI debate. What is General AI?&nbsp;</p><p>The Proposition might define General AI as &#8220;a being with human-like intelligence and emotions indistinguishable from a human in all but origin.&#8221; If the Opposition lets that definition slide, they&#8217;ve probably already lost the debate.&nbsp;</p><p>More likely they&#8217;ll come back and say that the definition is wrong, and that experts agree that, &#8220;Artificial general intelligence is the hypothetical ability of an intelligent agent to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>The Proposition might come back and call the Opposition out for using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">Wikipedia</a> definition, reiterate their own, and argue as if their own definition is true.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The outcome of a debate between experienced debaters often comes down to whose definition stands.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If General AI is indistinguishable from a human, <em>of course</em> it should have fundamental rights (and let&#8217;s not even get started on the definition of fundamental rights!).&nbsp;</p><p>If General AI is just a hypothetical ability to understand or learn intellectual tasks, it should probably have rights more similar to computers than humans. </p><p>Really, if you win the definition battle, the actual points you make don&#8217;t matter as much.&nbsp;</p><p>All to say &#8211; debate is a really fun intellectual battle if you&#8217;re a nerd like me, but it&#8217;s not good for finding the truth and it&#8217;s not a particularly useful way to approach real-world conversations.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, over the past few weeks, a <strong>debate</strong> is exactly what the web3 discourse has turned into.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>The Web3 Discourse: More Debate Than Dialogue</strong></h3><p>Probably since the day Satoshi dropped that whitepaper in 2008, there have been people who are for crypto and those who are against it. Among those who are for it, warring factions fight for the supremacy of their coin and chain of choice.&nbsp;</p><p>The in-fighting is silly, counterproductive, and never-ending. Bitcoin vs. Ethereum. Ethereum vs. All Other Smart Contract L1s. Arbitrum vs. Optimism. Bitcoin vs. The World. As I&#8217;ve written before, I&#8217;m a Maximalist Minimalist.</p><p>The ex-fighting is constant, too, but the angle of attack shifts and evolves. First, the anti-argument was that crypto was just used by criminals. Then it was that it&#8217;s bad for the environment. When one criticism is sufficiently disproven, critics move on to the next.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Today, the argument seems to be that web3 &#8211; inclusive of traditional &#8220;crypto&#8221; and things like dApps, NFTs, social tokens, and DeFi &#8211; is a construct made up by VCs and isn&#8217;t as decentralized as you think it is.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever the <em>raison du jour</em>, <strong>people rarely change sides or change their mind</strong>. </p><p>I would imagine you could administer a personality test that had nothing to do with crypto &#8211; like the <a href="https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test">Big Five Personality Test</a> &#8211; and learn with a high degree of accuracy who is on which side. You could do the same by looking at someone&#8217;s fifty most recent tweets on other technologies or new things. If the people who disliked Elvis and Rock &#8216;N Roll in the 1950s were alive today, chances are, they&#8217;d be anti-crypto.&nbsp;</p><p>So really, what&#8217;s happening is that people pick their sides in advance, and then try to use whatever evidence they can to make their case instead of taking in the evidence and then making up their mind.</p><p>In that sense, the <strong>web3 discourse is more debate than dialogue</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>If we look at it as a Parliamentary debate, the <strong>resolution</strong> of this particular one would be something like: &#8220;<strong>Web3 is good.</strong>&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>In the Opposition&#8217;s opening speech, Jack Dorsey, ex-Twitter and current-Block CEO and Bitcoin Maximalist, set the stage for this particular debate in December when he tweeted this:&nbsp;</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473139010197508098&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;You don&#8217;t own &#8220;web3.&#8221;\n\nThe VCs and their LPs do.

His biggest contribution to the Opposition was this idea that <strong>web3 actually relies on a lot more centralized technology than your opponents would have you believe.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Now that you&#8217;ve been trained in the subtlety of debate, you should be able to see what&#8217;s going on here. Jack and Moxie<strong> shifted the battleground to a debate over degrees of centralization</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>They&#8217;re trying to win the definition battle. Instead of a more vague &#8220;Web3 is good,&#8221; they tightened the focus to a more easily winnable, <strong>&#8220;Web3 is more centralized than it appears from the outside, which is bad.&#8221;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Like experienced debaters, Moxie and Jack shifted the battleground with subtlety and tact&#8230;</p><p>And then Professor Scott Galloway crashed through the wall like the Kool-Aid Man.&nbsp;</p><p>Uninvited, Galloway joined the debate and exposed his side&#8217;s tricks in a ham-handed rebuttal for the Opposition.</p><h3><strong>Prof G Enters the Web3 Debate</strong></h3><p>Let me flashback for a minute.&nbsp;</p><p>When I debated in high school, sometimes we&#8217;d get randomly assigned teams of three. If you got a team with two strong debaters and one weak one, ideally, you&#8217;d go <strong>strong, weak, strong</strong> for the course of your three speeches. The strong lead-off debater could set the tone, the weaker one would stumble a little in the middle, and then the other strong debater could come in and clean up the mess with a powerful <strong>rebuttal</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes, though, the weaker debater would ask to do the rebuttal and you didn&#8217;t have the heart to tell them no, so you let them go last&#8230; and it was a train wreck.&nbsp;</p><p>The rebuttal is the closing argument. It&#8217;s often make or break. In the rebuttal, a debater sums up his or her team&#8217;s points, once again tears down the opposing team&#8217;s points, and then tries to tie a compelling bow on the whole thing. No new information is allowed in a rebuttal; it&#8217;s just a summary of what&#8217;s been said. The best you can do is use more colorful and compelling language on top of the existing points, and structure everything in a way that makes your team look good.&nbsp;</p><p>It should be fairly easy &#8211; there are no new points to make &#8211; but in the hands of a weak or inexperienced debater, the rebuttal can be a disaster.&nbsp;</p><p>When that happens, the problem is often that the two stronger debaters were the ones who came up with most of the arguments and figured out how they fit together into a larger narrative. They felt the arguments in their bones, grokked them on a deeper level, and actually understood what they were trying to say, but they needed to rely on the weaker debater to deliver them.&nbsp;</p><p>Often, even if the weaker debater mostly made the right points, there was just something in the delivery and the word choices and the flow and the way they leaned on their notes and looked at their partners that made it clear that it wasn&#8217;t <em>their argument, </em>that they didn&#8217;t actually know what they were talking about.&nbsp;</p><p>That&#8217;s what it felt like reading the Prof&#8217;s rant against web3.&nbsp;</p><p>Take this paragraph, a short, simple one that exposes so much of his schtick:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1562adf3-4bcb-4521-9ec6-2e171cecc4fb_634x199.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1562adf3-4bcb-4521-9ec6-2e171cecc4fb_634x199.png" width="634" height="199" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1562adf3-4bcb-4521-9ec6-2e171cecc4fb_634x199.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:199,&quot;width&quot;:634,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1562adf3-4bcb-4521-9ec6-2e171cecc4fb_634x199.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1562adf3-4bcb-4521-9ec6-2e171cecc4fb_634x199.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1562adf3-4bcb-4521-9ec6-2e171cecc4fb_634x199.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1562adf3-4bcb-4521-9ec6-2e171cecc4fb_634x199.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>No Mercy / No Malice</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>&#8220;Woah!&#8221; you might think reading this, &#8220;The Prof is wicked smaht! He knows about web3 infrastructure, he must know his stuff! I can trust everything else he&#8217;s saying.&#8221;</p><p>Truth is, this is a bad copy-paste-reword job from Moxie&#8217;s piece. While he <em>did</em> link to the piece (that&#8217;s the underline under &#8220;people don&#8217;t want to run their own servers&#8221;), he didn&#8217;t mention Moxie&#8217;s name anywhere in the piece or the paragraph.&nbsp;</p><p>That might be forgiven as a style thing. Personally, I would have led with something like &#8220;As Signal CEO Moxie Marlinspike pointed out&#8230;&#8221; lest people thought I was trying to pass the ideas off as my own, but that&#8217;s just me. But there are a couple of other things hidden in there that show that the Prof was just regurgitating instead of understanding.&nbsp;</p><p>First, the only original idea in the paragraph &#8211; that people don&#8217;t want to have to write code every time they buy a loaf of bread &#8211; <strong>is a straw man</strong>. Of course it would be bad if people had to write code to buy bread, but that doesn&#8217;t matter because <em>no one in the world is suggesting that people would need to write a single line of code to buy anything</em>.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65536d59-091d-48f6-a919-79a6d9802e22_480x270.gif"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65536d59-091d-48f6-a919-79a6d9802e22_480x270.gif" width="480" height="270" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/65536d59-091d-48f6-a919-79a6d9802e22_480x270.gif&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:270,&quot;width&quot;:480,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65536d59-091d-48f6-a919-79a6d9802e22_480x270.gif 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65536d59-091d-48f6-a919-79a6d9802e22_480x270.gif 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65536d59-091d-48f6-a919-79a6d9802e22_480x270.gif 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65536d59-091d-48f6-a919-79a6d9802e22_480x270.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Second, <strong>the Prof fails to point out that <a href="https://blog.alchemy.com/blog/alchemy-series-c-release">a16z led Alchemy&#8217;s Series C</a> in October at a $3.5 billion valuation</strong>. He takes every opportunity to come at a16z throughout, including its investments in Coinbase and OpenSea, but misses this layup! If I were his debate partner, I would have steam coming out of my ears.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, that&#8217;s just one paragraph in a larger debate. If you&#8217;re keeping score at home:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Jack delivered the first speech for web3&#8217;s Opposition and tried to set the definitions, to make the debate about VC ownership in web3. He shook things up. It was effective.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Moxie delivered the second speech, handling some of the Proposition&#8217;s claims and adding a new point for the Opposition: that the tech stack was more centralized than people realized, too. Also well done.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Then, the Prof stepped up to deliver the rebuttal for the Opposition, and&#8230; woof.</p></li></ul><p>Now, again, I think that the web3 debate is kind of dumb, that there are good and bad pieces and good and bad actors, that some things should be centralized and others should be decentralized, that nothing is all good or all bad (for a more nuanced synthesis of the Proposition and Opposition, check out my friend Dror&#8217;s <em><a href="https://www.drorpoleg.com/unpacking-the-web3-sausage/">Unpacking the Web3 Sausage</a>)</em>. I&#8217;d prefer a more constructive conversation.&nbsp;</p><p>Everything, everywhere, always is about trade-offs. Web3 is no different. I&#8217;d prefer a more constructive conversation that starts there. A Debate is so&#8230; violent. </p><p>But like I said, I don&#8217;t like when me and my friends are misrepresented.&nbsp;</p><p>So I decided to dust off the old Debate Pants and enter the fray to deliver the rebuttal for the Proposition, &#8220;Web3 is good.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>My Rebuttal for the Proposition in the Web3 Debate&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Ladies and gentlemen, judges, teammates, and of course, esteemed opponents: thank you for being here this morning for this riveting debate.&nbsp;</p><p>Because we&#8217;ve wandered a little off course, I&#8217;d like to remind everyone what we&#8217;re debating. I&#8217;ll read the resolution right from the paper to make sure I don&#8217;t miss anything: &#8220;<strong>Web3 is good.</strong>&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>Now, the Opposition has tried everything to make this entire debate about <strong>centralization versus decentralization</strong>. If there is centralization anywhere &#8211; on the cap table or in the tech stack or in the platforms consumers choose to use &#8211; they&#8217;d have you believe, then web3 is bad. And they&#8217;ve shown that there is centralization in places. Of course there is! You&#8217;ll hear no argument here. </p><p>But that does not mean the Opposition has won, because that&#8217;s not what this debate is about.</p><p>Arguments around specific attributes of web3, or of any network, like centralization or the existence of bad actors, are besides the point, like arguing that the internet is bad because Facebook or 4chan exist.&nbsp;</p><p>We agree openly that there are bad actors and scams and frauds, and that a lot of tokens sit in the wallets of a few people. We agree that there is a lot more work to be done to build a truly decentralized internet for those who want it, and vehemently agree that not everybody will.&nbsp;</p><p>We&#8217;d go even further than our opponents and say that <strong>a fully decentralized future is impossible</strong>. Some people will always prefer centralized services for everything, many more will prefer fully decentralized services for some things and centralized ones for others.&nbsp;</p><p>But this debate is not about centralization versus decentralization. It&#8217;s about <strong>choice</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>This debate is about whether or not web3, an internet owned by the users and builders, orchestrated with tokens, is net good or net bad for humanity, not just as it stands today in its earliest form, but in the promise it holds.</strong> (<em>See what I did there?)</em></p><p>It&#8217;s about whether the world will be better if entrepreneurs have web3 tools at their disposal, or not. Again, it&#8217;s about choice &#8211; choice for builders and choice for users.&nbsp;</p><p>Some people will want centralized services, some will want fully decentralized ones, many will choose points on the spectrum in between that work for them at different times and for different things. We&#8217;re arguing that they should have that choice.</p><p>And we&#8217;re arguing that web3 gives them that choice.</p><p>But we&#8217;ll get there. First, allow me to <strong>try to dismantle the Opposition&#8217;s arguments, as summarized in Professor Galloway&#8217;s rebuttal</strong>. I&#8217;ll show you why they&#8217;re irrelevant, incorrect, misleading, or just plain wrong. Importantly, I&#8217;ll show that <strong>when the evidence didn&#8217;t </strong><em><strong>quite</strong></em><strong> fit, he bent the truth to make it fit.</strong></p><p>This web of lies underpins what the Prof tries to pass off as an argument. If you weren&#8217;t able to follow it, I understand. I&#8217;ll try to summarize. It goes something like this:</p><p>The elites are using the &#8220;promise of decentralization&#8221; to centralize control and achieve unimaginable riches. Centralization is evident in NFT and Bitcoin ownership, a Forbes list of twelve (12) cryptobillionaires, would-be-monopolies like Coinbase and OpenSea, and the infrastructure itself. There&#8217;s crime. DAOs aren&#8217;t that centralized because ConstitutionDAO wasn&#8217;t and because they elect representatives, and hey, why do we need new internet-native structures when we have public companies anyway? Also, centralization is pretty good because of the Webb Space Telescope, and web3 tools like NFTs and DAOs have potential, but like not that much potential, and regulators need to stop the innovators. Also, a16z invested in centralized companies. Meet the new boss&#8230; he&#8217;s your old boss. Plus, Elon&#8217;s on my side and Gary Gensler better do something. Anyway, Silicon Valley is trying to take over the media, the economy, and the military to achieve complete tyranny and they do <em>not</em> want web3 to be regulated. Web3 is the same thing as Web2.0, and Facebook and Google have too much control. Ask someone with teen girls if that&#8217;s good.</p><p>I&#8217;m exaggerating a little here, but not really. Go back and read his piece. That&#8217;s the flow. It may not be <em>yoga</em>babble, but it&#8217;s <em>something</em>babble.&nbsp;</p><p>But an incoherent argument should draw sympathy, not ire.&nbsp;</p><p>What got my blood up were the <strong>four</strong> specific misdirections, two of which I was involved in personally, a third which I was a part of publicly disproving, and a fourth which is just plain numbers. You&#8217;ll see that without those, the Prof&#8217;s argument makes even less sense.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Misdirection #1</strong></h4><p>Debate is so often a battle of definitions, so my ears perked up when the Prof used a modified version of <a href="https://future.a16z.com/why-web3-matters/">my definition of web3</a> (and called it &#8220;yogababble&#8221;).&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c271555-8113-494e-be98-dc977832a51f_611x192.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c271555-8113-494e-be98-dc977832a51f_611x192.png" width="611" height="192" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8c271555-8113-494e-be98-dc977832a51f_611x192.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:192,&quot;width&quot;:611,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c271555-8113-494e-be98-dc977832a51f_611x192.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c271555-8113-494e-be98-dc977832a51f_611x192.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c271555-8113-494e-be98-dc977832a51f_611x192.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c271555-8113-494e-be98-dc977832a51f_611x192.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>No Mercy / No Malice</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Yogababble is one of the Prof&#8217;s favorite words. He actually repeated it later in the piece, arguing that decentralization has &#8220;created a Coachella for fraud, where anonymity, yogababble, and complexity protect the fraudsters from oversight or accountability.&#8221; I&#8217;m not offended by the characterization. I don&#8217;t think mine is a perfect definition by any stretch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What I am a little offended by is that the Prof tweaked my words to fit his core argument &#8211; that web3 isn&#8217;t actually as decentralized as it seems. Specifically, he added the word <strong>decentralized </strong>to the definition.</p><p>The actual definition I used in the piece that he linked to is: &#8220;<strong>Web3 is the internet owned by the builders and users, orchestrated with tokens</strong>.&#8221; I intentionally <em>didn&#8217;t</em> use the word decentralized because I don&#8217;t think decentralization is actually the key feature. But it does make a good <strong>straw man</strong>, and so the Prof threw it in there.&nbsp;</p><p>To be charitable, it&#8217;s a subtle difference, and decentralization <em>was</em> discussed in the <a href="https://future.a16z.com/why-web3-matters/">piece he referenced</a>. </p><p>But ultimately, that&#8217;s not the definition I used.

The 2% includes wallets for exchanges like Coinbase, whose wallets hold Bitcoin for millions of people. Adjusting for that, the top 2% own 71.5% of Bitcoin. That Glassnode article is not obscure; it&#8217;s the fourth thing that comes up when you Google &#8220;Bitcoin concentration.&#8221;</p><p>We agree that 71.5% is still a heavy concentration; not as sensational as 95%, but it has the benefit of being accurate, to the extent that matters to our opponent. We agree that we would like to see ownership more evenly distributed. But we disagree that it&#8217;s relevant to the Professor&#8217;s argument, especially since to the Prof&#8217;s teammate, Jack, web3 and Bitcoin are very different. </p><p>It&#8217;s another small thing, but I hope you&#8217;re picking up a pattern of the Prof disregarding any evidence that is inconvenient to his case.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Misdirection #3</strong></h4><p>Next, the Prof argued that DAOs are often not-decentralized by using the example of <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/lets-buy-the-us-constitution">ConstitutionDAO</a>, which I was involved in. Specifically, he wrote:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>ConstitutionDAO, which made news when it lost out in a $43 million bidding war for an original copy of the U.S. Constitution, <strong>hadn&#8217;t even established a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22820563/constitution-meme-47-million-crypto-crowdfunding-blockchain-ethereum-constitution">governance model</a> before it shut down, because the founders hadn&#8217;t figured out how to prevent a few large holders, or &#8220;whales,&#8221; from taking control</strong>. [Emphasis mine]</em></p></blockquote><p>He linked to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22820563/constitution-meme-47-million-crypto-crowdfunding-blockchain-ethereum-constitution">this conversation</a> that core team member <a href="https://twitter.com/Jierlich">Jonah Erlich</a> had with The Verge&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/reckless">Nilay Patel</a>. Turns out, that&#8217;s not really what Jonah said. I&#8217;m going to give the full section of the conversation here to show you how the Prof picked and chose:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Verge</strong>: <strong>When someone buys tokens named $PEOPLE or $WTP, do they get one vote per token?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>&#8203;&#8203;Jonah:</strong> We had not figured out the governance model. In the rush to be able to buy this document, there were a lot of details that we were going to figure out after we had won. We were actually discussing different governance models had we won. One of the big concerns is that some of the large holders in the crypto world &#8212; we call these whales &#8212; would have outsized control over what happens with the documents. Our big message is: this is a movement for the people. This is the people&#8217;s document, so we want to have it controlled by the people.</em></p><p><em>We were looking at different mechanisms. We were looking at the direct democracy voting: one token, one vote. We were also looking at one vote per wallet, which isn&#8217;t an exact proxy for one person, but it&#8217;s pretty close. Quadratic voting is another mechanism in which voting power is actually diminished when a person has more tokens: you don&#8217;t have a hundred extra votes for every hundred extra tokens, but rather a smaller amount of votes as that number of tokens increases.</em></p><p><em><strong>Verge: When you say DAO is speedrunning the history of organizational structure, you&#8217;re describing speedrunning the history of democracy: setting up a voting system and figuring out how those votes will be representative of a group of people. However, a group of people has to make those decisions; not exactly democratic. How is that working for ConstitutionDAO?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Jonah:</strong> There&#8217;s a good concept called progressive decentralization: it&#8217;s really hard to actually start something fully decentralized, so you have to start with an initial team that builds something, who then brings it to decentralization. Our plan with ConstitutionDAO [was] that, once we win this auction, we&#8217;re going as fast as we can to becoming fully decentralized to the greatest extent possible.</em></p></blockquote><p>Only in the least charitable interpretation could you read the above as &#8220;hadn&#8217;t established a governance model because they couldn&#8217;t figure out how to stop whales from taking over.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, Jonah mentioned whales in response to Patel&#8217;s question about whether people would get one vote per token, not as a reason that there wasn&#8217;t a governance model in place. The truth is the opposite of the point that the Prof made; the founders knew <em>exactly </em>how to stop whales from taking over: don&#8217;t give one vote per token.</p><p>As Jonah laid out, the real story was:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>There was less than a week from idea to auction,</p></li><li><p>The team chose to tackle things that weren&#8217;t mission-critical, like a governance model in the case of a win, until we actually won,&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The potential governance options were known (Jonah listed a few); that wasn&#8217;t the bottleneck,</p></li><li><p>The plan all along, as it should be for 99.9% of DAOs, was to <a href="https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/">progressively decentralize</a>, which is accepted best practice.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>That&#8217;s not me leaning on memory and first-hand experience, that&#8217;s exactly what Jonah said in the conversation the Prof referenced. The Prof just chose to leave out anything that didn&#8217;t fit his point.</p><p>That a 6-day-old project had not yet decentralized is a weak and amateur indictment of the concept of DAOs as a whole. Indeed, it seems the Prof&#8217;s arguments against DAOs more broadly are based on a very basic and inaccurate model of governance in which maximum decentralization is the goal and every decision should be one person, one vote. That doesn&#8217;t reflect the reality on the ground.</p><h4><strong>Misdirection #4</strong></h4><p>Finally, my opponent argued that the decentralization narrative &#8220;is a false god evangelized by high priests who pass collection plates the size of Mars and <strong>admonish regulation as heresy</strong>.&#8221; <em>[Emphasis mine]</em></p><p>The language is fun and colorful; the point is simply untrue.&nbsp;</p><p>Outside of a handful of Bitcoin maximalists (who tend to hate on web3 anyway), there is not a single serious person in web3 or crypto or whatever you want to call it who doesn&#8217;t believe that it should be regulated, let alone who believes that regulation is heresy. Every founder and investor I&#8217;ve ever spoken to on the topic wants regulation in the US to come sooner so they can stop building and investing in ambiguity.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, when a16z&#8217;s Chris Dixon and I wrote about the <em><a href="https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2021/11/08/chris-dixon-and-packy-mccormick-on-the-future-of-crypto">future of crypto in The Economist</a>, </em>we ended the piece with a call for sensible regulation of the industry in America and beyond:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>In the coming year more leaders, in America and in other democracies, will realise the need for sensible regulation that encourages responsible innovation while also allowing entrepreneurs to build the next generation of the internet.</em></p></blockquote><p>a16z, where I am an advisor and which the Prof decided to single out with its own section, has a <a href="https://a16z.com/web3-policy/">section on its website dedicated to web3 policy</a>, which states:</p><blockquote><p><em>We are radically optimistic about the potential of web3 to restore trust in institutions and expand access to opportunity. But realizing that potential depends on smart policy. <strong>Good regulation establishes a framework for how innovation can benefit society while managing the real risks that might otherwise harm consumers</strong>. It&#8217;s time to <a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WEB3-Policy-Handbook-PxP.pdf.pdf">define that vision</a>.</em></p></blockquote><p>No one is admonishing regulation as heresy. Quite the opposite. I suggest that the Prof take a glimpse at the firm&#8217;s recommendations for policymakers&#8230;&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd908ec4b-5bca-4609-b6aa-4782343b1398_1008x427.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd908ec4b-5bca-4609-b6aa-4782343b1398_1008x427.png" width="1008" height="427" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d908ec4b-5bca-4609-b6aa-4782343b1398_1008x427.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:427,&quot;width&quot;:1008,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd908ec4b-5bca-4609-b6aa-4782343b1398_1008x427.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd908ec4b-5bca-4609-b6aa-4782343b1398_1008x427.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd908ec4b-5bca-4609-b6aa-4782343b1398_1008x427.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd908ec4b-5bca-4609-b6aa-4782343b1398_1008x427.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em><a href="https://a16z.com/web3-policy/">a16z</a></em></figcaption></figure></div><p>&#8230; or peruse its <em><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WEB3-Policy-Handbook-PxP.pdf.pdf">U.S. Policy Agenda</a>, <a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WEB3-Policy-Handbook-PxP.pdf.pdf">Global Policy Agenda</a>,</em> or <em><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DAO-Legal-Framework-Jennings-Kerr10.19.21-Final.pdf">Legal Framework for DAOs</a>.</em></p><p>These are the facts. But the facts might get in the way of the Professor&#8217;s good story. Bring the truth to light and all he&#8217;s left with are, as @Jack would say: &#8220;Words.&#8221;</p><p>Of course, there are more examples of little things that betray a lack of understanding, or a lack of desire to understand.</p><p>He mentions a16z&#8217;s investment in the centralized exchange, Coinbase, but not its investment in the decentralized exchange, Uniswap.&nbsp;</p><p>He points to data showing that blockchain tokens launched recently have more insider ownership at share launch without acknowledging that most of those projects were founded and funded during crypto winter and needed VC funding to survive.</p><p>No doubt taking a cue from Moxie, he also used OpenSea as an example of web3&#8217;s centralization. He overplayed his hand without understanding the facts:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>The potential to establish <strong>monopoly power</strong>, to own the rails (i.e., to centralize), is increasingly what VCs fund, and that&#8217;s the true protocol for web3. OpenSea, the world&#8217;s largest NFT marketplace, is eerily similar to any other exchange platform: In return for making transactions easier and (modestly) <a href="https://beincrypto.com/2-2-million-bored-ape-nfts-stolen-opensea-freezes-transactions/">safer</a>, the company takes a <a href="https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500011590241-What-are-OpenSea-s-fees-">2.5%</a> cut of every transaction.</em></p></blockquote><p>Ironically, four days before the Prof published his piece, an NFT platform called <a href="https://looksrare.org/">LooksRare</a> launched. NFT platforms launch all the time. What made this one particularly relevant is how it bootstrapped initial demand.&nbsp;</p><p>LooksRare airdropped 12% of its total $LOOKS token supply on users based largely on how much volume they transacted on OpenSea between June and December 2021. That data was easy for them to access; it was all publicly available on the Ethereum blockchain.&nbsp;</p><p>LooksRare was able to attract OpenSea&#8217;s biggest customers by giving the biggest rewards to the people who&#8217;d spent the most on OpenSea. They were also able to induce those customers to perform specific activities on LooksRare to unlock those tokens: I wasn&#8217;t able to claim my 200 $LOOKS until I listed an NFT for sale on the platform. I&#8217;ve actually never even listed an NFT on OpenSea, but I <em>have</em> listed one on LooksRare now!&nbsp;</p><p>So is it working?

It&#8217;s about the fact that the data is open, that builders and users have choice, and that they&#8217;ll choose the platforms that extract less and give them more ownership.</strong></p><p>In web3, if a platform misleads its users, those users can choose to take their data and money to another platform.&nbsp;</p><p>It also highlights why the whole debate is practically meaningless. While we exchanged words, a few entrepreneurs opened up their laptops, built something better, and made the case for web3 better than I ever could.&nbsp;</p><p>I hope we can end this silly debate now and engage in more nuanced, thoughtful conversation like the one prompted by Moxie&#8217;s piece instead of loud and inaccurate yelling like the Prof&#8217;s. Or just get out of the way. </p><p>Web3 isn&#8217;t all good or all bad, but we believe it&#8217;s net good, it&#8217;s happening either way, and it deserves more thoughtful and honest critiques and, yes, regulation, in order to reach its full potential.</p><p>Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, I rest my case.

I&#8217;ve only done Sponsored Deep Dives on private companies (and one blockchain), not for any reason other than the fact that startups have been the only ones to reach out. As a reminder, you can read how I choose what companies to write Sponsored Deep Dives on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K24dAK5k7LHuYMsJMyd2acDSqw8bEdJm_pciVrmVNXA/edit">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Oscar fits the three things I look for in a Sponsored Deep Dive company:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p><strong>I believe in the company.</strong> Table stakes, but true here. I would invest my own money (although I haven&#8217;t yet to avoid that layer of conflict) and I would write about Oscar even if they weren&#8217;t paying me (don&#8217;t tell Oscar!).&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>The company has lessons applicable beyond the company itself, and potential benefits to you all. </strong>There&#8217;s a ton to learn here for anyone interested in taking on regulated, backwards industries with deep-pocketed, scaled incumbents. (Hint: it&#8217;s a long, hard road, but doable!)</p></li><li><p><strong>The company&#8217;s story is interesting and fits with the trends we&#8217;re all most interested in. </strong>I started writing about healthcare a lot more at the end of last year, and it&#8217;s one of the complex problems I want to dig into more this year. This decade could be to HealthTech what the past one has been to FinTech.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>Beyond those three things, Oscar is a special one. It&#8217;s the only health insurance provider I&#8217;ve actually chosen for myself (way back in 2013), one of NYC&#8217;s most successful startups of the past decade, and my favorite kind of company: one whose complexity means that the market has a hard time understanding it.&nbsp;</p><p>That complexity comes from the fact that Oscar is trying to be two things at once: an insurance company and a tech platform. It&#8217;s a big bet -- those are two very different businesses -- but if it pays off, they have the chance to make the healthcare experience meaningfully better.&nbsp;</p><p>Plus, while it&#8217;s no longer private, it&#8217;s still very much an underdog in an industry full of giant incumbents, just like a startup. Despite its success, people still assume the giants will hold their positions for decades. Maybe that&#8217;s true in insurance in a way that it hasn&#8217;t been for any other industry, but that&#8217;s not the bet I&#8217;d make.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me put the disclaimer/disclosure right up front:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Disclaimer/Disclosure: </strong><em><strong>THIS IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE!</strong> It never is, but that&#8217;s particularly true in an industry like insurance in which I&#8217;ve spent much less time.

Finance</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>On the surface, the mystery is solved simply: <strong>Oscar isn&#8217;t profitable yet</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Say what you want about the traditional US health insurance industry (OK, fine, twist my arm: it&#8217;s confusing, inefficient, expensive, antiquated, and about 20 years behind on UX), but those companies <em>print</em> money. In Q3 2021, UnitedHealth, the most profitable, made $4.1 billion on $72.3 billion in revenue.&nbsp;</p><p>Oscar, on the other hand, loses money on every patient on average. In health insurance terms, its <strong><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/combinedratio.asp">combined ratio</a></strong> is greater than 100%. In Q3 2021, Oscar put up an adjusted EBITDA loss of $189 million on $673 million in revenue. Oscar&#8217;s stock had started to recover into Q3 earnings, but fell when the company reported that its medical loss ratio (MLR) &#8211; the percentage of premium it pays out for care &#8211; shot up from 82.4% in Q2 to 99.7% in Q3 thanks to an unfavorable risk adjustment data validation (essentially an insurance payment audit and true-up, <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Monitoring-Programs/Medicare-Risk-Adjustment-Data-Validation-Program/Overview">read more here if you really want</a>) and, of course, COVID.&nbsp;</p><p>Oscar&#8217;s <strong>membership grew 41%</strong> YoY, from 420k to 594k, and <strong>revenue grew 63%</strong>, but the simple bear case would be that, amending the old joke for health insurance, you <strong>can&#8217;t lose money on every managed life and make it up in volume</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>But still, Oscar is trading below 1x its current revenue run rate, growing very fast, and signing up big partners to its software platform, +Oscar. It feels like an overreaction.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides, Oscar wasn&#8217;t designed to be profitable yet. In fact, it&#8217;s doing <strong>two unprofitable things at the same time</strong>: building an insurance company and a tech platform from scratch. Both require real <strong>scale </strong>to become profitable, and Oscar&#8217;s bet is that by combining both, they&#8217;ll be able to achieve more scale, deliver better care, and generate better margins over the long-term than either side could alone.&nbsp;</p><p>That&#8217;s why Oscar is making three decades-long, interconnected bets:</p><p><strong>Bet #1:</strong> <strong>Technology can meaningfully improve member engagement, which leads to a better insurance business.</strong></p><p>Oscar believes that by building a better experience, it can increase member engagement, by increasing member engagement, it can better guide its members&#8217; care, and that by guiding its members care, it can create better long-term health outcomes at a lower cost.&nbsp;</p><p>The pithy way to explain this piece of the strategy is that an <strong>ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bet #2:</strong> <strong>A better, tech-powered insurance business will help Oscar sell its technology to hospital systems who want to take risk, improving margins and increasing revenue without increasing Oscar&#8217;s risk.</strong></p><p>In 2018, Oscar launched what would become <strong>+Oscar</strong>, its tech platform that lets health systems and other insurers tap into all of the tech that Oscar has built over the past decade.&nbsp;</p><p>To understand this piece of the strategy, think <strong>Amazon and AWS</strong>. Oscar has spent a decade building and battle-testing its own proprietary tech, and now it&#8217;s selling that tech to others who need it and earning software margins in the process. Plus, those customers give Oscar scale.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bet #3:</strong> <strong>Turning its tech into a platform for third-parties will build scale into both the insurance and tech businesses, which will help improve care and lower costs.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Combining Oscar&#8217;s insurance business with its +Oscar partners&#8217; &#8211; like the Cleveland Clinic and Montefiore &#8211; will give Oscar the scale it needs to build a huge, profitable insurance business. Scale is useful in two ways here:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p><strong>Insurance Business. </strong>More scale means more leverage over the participants in its supply chain, better terms with reinsurers (reinsurance makes up a huge chunk of insurers&#8217; costs), more ability to convince providers to join the network, and a lower admin ratio (amortize administrative costs over more members).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Tech Platform. </strong>By opening its tech up as a set of primitives for others in the ecosystem to build with, it will get more data on which types of interventions, digital and physical, work best for which types of patients, and any campaigns it builds for one partner can be copy-pasted and used by <em>any </em>partner, building network effects into the system.

It&#8217;s one data point that letting people choose for themselves each year makes for a more efficient market.&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily, the ACA market has been growing, with a <a href="https://www.einnews.com/pr_news/560263180/hhs-announces-13-8-million-americans-with-health-care-coverage-ahead-of-jan-15th-open-enrollment-deadline">21% increase in enrollments</a> over last year during this year&#8217;s open enrollment period (which ends on Saturday in case you still need to enroll!).&nbsp;</p><p>This is the part of the market that Oscar has been focused on, for a few reasons:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p>The ACA opened up a new market when it launched in 2014, and it&#8217;s growing fast.</p></li><li><p>When consumers choose their own insurance, consumer experience matters more.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Individuals can stay with the same plan over their lifetime, regardless of whether they switch jobs, meaning that insurers in the individual market are incentivized to provide the best long-term outcomes at the lowest cost over time.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>Simply put: Oscar can make a bigger dent in the individual market, and move upmarket from there.</p><p>Whether focused on the individual, employer, Medicare, or Medicaid market, the way that insurance companies turn a profit is roughly the same.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Health Insurance Profit Formula&nbsp;</strong></p><p>For as complex as the US healthcare system is, and I&#8217;m going to gloss over a lot of complexity here, the formula for health insurance companies to make money is pretty simple:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Profit = Premiums - (Premiums * Medical Loss Ratio) - (Premium * Admin Ratio)&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Members pay monthly premiums to their insurers, and insurers pay out a percentage of those premiums in claims to cover members&#8217; medical expenses (<strong>Medical Loss Ratio, or MLR</strong>) and another percentage to cover administrative expenses, essentially SG&amp;A (<strong>Admin Ratio</strong>) . Together, the MLR and Admin Ratio are the <strong>Combined Ratio</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>There are other things in here &#8211; like reinsurance costs and risk adjustments &#8211; but I promised not to bore you. Just know those costs come out of direct and assumed policy premiums before getting to the &#8220;premiums earned&#8221; number that&#8217;s used in the ratio calculations.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, if the Combined Ratio is less than 100%, the insurance company makes money; if it&#8217;s more than 100%, it loses money.&nbsp;</p><p>Adding just one layer of complexity, the ACA requires insurers to pay out at least 80-85% of premiums in claims (80% for individual and small group insurers and 85% for large group insurers), and then refund any leftover money to members if they don&#8217;t.&nbsp;</p><p>So the name of the game is to get your MLR as close to 80-85% as possible, and keep administrative costs relatively low. When margins are capped, it&#8217;s all about scale.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Two Main Reimbursement Models</strong></p><p>There are two main reimbursement models in healthcare: <strong>fee-for-service</strong> and <strong>value-based care</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>fee-for-service</strong> model is what it sounds like: insurance companies reimburse healthcare providers based on the services that they provide. This incentivizes providers to provide more, and more expensive care. That would be great if more expensive care were correlated with better health outcomes, but it&#8217;s not. <strong>It&#8217;s almost entirely random</strong>.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ac6e1dc-8c9e-4674-b41e-cbe21ae7f6b6_921x423.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ac6e1dc-8c9e-4674-b41e-cbe21ae7f6b6_921x423.png" width="921" height="423" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2ac6e1dc-8c9e-4674-b41e-cbe21ae7f6b6_921x423.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:423,&quot;width&quot;:921,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ac6e1dc-8c9e-4674-b41e-cbe21ae7f6b6_921x423.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ac6e1dc-8c9e-4674-b41e-cbe21ae7f6b6_921x423.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ac6e1dc-8c9e-4674-b41e-cbe21ae7f6b6_921x423.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ac6e1dc-8c9e-4674-b41e-cbe21ae7f6b6_921x423.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em><a href="https://www.hioscar.com/deepdive/state-of-us-healthcare">Oscar, 2018</a></em></figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>Value-based care</strong>, on the other hand, is a form of reimbursement that ties payments to the quality of care provided, and ideally, to the results.

Josh and Mario, Harvard Business School classmates who&#8217;d been very successful since, are both really smart. If they couldn&#8217;t figure it out, there was a problem.</p><p>When they linked up, Mario told Josh he&#8217;d been thinking of ways to make US healthcare more efficient, and realized that many of the problems, and opportunities to fix them, stemmed from the <strong>health insurers</strong>. So Mario (CEO), Josh (now Chairman), and a third HBS classmate, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nazemi/">Kevin Nazemi</a>, a former director of healthcare at Microsoft, got to work.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d396155-6bad-4db4-b003-08d80ab49509_1920x1080.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d396155-6bad-4db4-b003-08d80ab49509_1920x1080.jpeg" width="1100" height="619" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6d396155-6bad-4db4-b003-08d80ab49509_1920x1080.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:619,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Insurance in the U.S. Is Broken.

Rebuilding a new tech stack from the ground up is hard and capital intensive. Doing both at the same time is doubly hard and doubly expensive.&nbsp;</p><p>Part of the bull case for Oscar is that it&#8217;s done a lot of the hardest, most expensive work. It&#8217;s still building, and it has an insurance business to run, but it&#8217;s entered the <strong>scaling phase</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, whether you&#8217;re bullish on Oscar or not comes down to whether you believe the core thesis<strong>: that the tech it&#8217;s built fundamentally improves the insurance business.</strong></p><h3><strong>Oscar: The Tech-Enabled Insurance Business</strong></h3><p>The main idea behind Oscar is that by increasing member engagement, building trust, and <strong>being a member&#8217;s first call</strong> when seeking healthcare, it can run more of healthcare through its own tools -- virtual primary care, virtual urgent care, care routing, and more. Oscar can get you the right care, at the right time, and then wrap plans around that care.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;If you follow the plan,&#8221; Mario told me, &#8220;we can save you money and save us money.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>Easier said than done. Nobody calls their insurance provider first when they need care. Gun to my head, I&#8217;m not sure I could tell you who my insurance provider even is. To get consumers to engage with Oscar like they&#8217;d engage with any other best-in-class consumer product, they need to have a best-in-class consumer product. It&#8217;s why Oscar had to build everything from the ground up. It had to combine a bunch of different pieces into one, seamless package.&nbsp;</p><p>Jim Barksdale famously said, &#8220;There are only two ways I know of to make money: bundling and unbundling.&#8221; It&#8217;s rare to see one company do both.&nbsp;</p><p>The <strong>first part of Oscar&#8217;s master plan</strong>, which it&#8217;s been executing on for the past decade, is to bundle a bunch of things that other companies offer as point solutions into one seamless health insurance plan:</p><ul><li><p>Custom-Built Provider Networks</p></li><li><p>Plans</p></li><li><p>Member Engagement: Digital Experience and Care Teams</p></li><li><p>Virtual Primary Care &amp; Virtual Urgent Care</p></li><li><p>Claims Management&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Remember, the point of all of this is to provide better care at a lower cost, since Oscar is on the hook for paying care costs out of its premiums. Let&#8217;s go over each briefly.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Provider Networks.</strong> In every market it enters, Oscar builds out its own <strong>provider network</strong>: hospitals and doctors that accept Oscar insurance plans. They build around healthcare systems and then add in independent providers as needed. In New York City, for example, Mario told me that they have about 20k of the 40k providers in-network. The company uses the data that it has as a health insurer to pick providers based on a combination of quality, affordability, and other factors.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Plans.</strong> Oscar&#8217;s bread and butter is serving individuals, who make up about 6% of the market nationally.&nbsp;</p><p>Oscar offers them plans that conform to the <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/choose-a-plan/plans-categories/">ACA metal categories</a>: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. Finding a plan is dead simple. Enter your age and zip code, click see plans, and get a list of plans by category laid out cleanly.

It&#8217;s never this simple or straightforward.&nbsp;</p><p>Oscar <strong>competes on experience, not price</strong>. It rarely offers the cheapest premiums in the markets it serves; it doesn&#8217;t try to. In fact, in the roadshow video the company made heading into its IPO, Josh pointed out that <strong>Oscar has been growing despite only being the cheapest plan in less than 10% of its markets</strong>. In 2022, it&#8217;s only going to be the cheapest plan in 5% of its markets. Recall the Health Insurance Profit Formula; higher premiums give Oscar more room to pay more for great care. That great care upfront should lead to lower costs over time.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the higher price, the better experience attracts customers. Typically, Oscar launches in a market with 7-8% market share, and grows to 15% by year three.</p><p>Over the past three years, Oscar has begun expanding its addressable market to serve small groups (companies with fewer than 50 employees) and Medicare Advantage (people over 65 can purchase their own healthcare with government money), largely through +Oscar partnerships. We&#8217;ll cover these below.&nbsp;</p><p>All told, Oscar&#8217;s total addressable market in these three categories alone is roughly <strong>$450 billion </strong>in premiums. There&#8217;s a lot of room to run.</p><p><strong>Member Engagement&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>In value-based care, it&#8217;s all about being the first call.</strong> Being the first call lets Oscar route members to cost-effective options, collect valuable data, and manage their care more comprehensively.</p><p>To that end, Oscar members have access to an app and website through which they can find doctors, schedule appointments, manage prescriptions, and complete appointment follow-ups. Through a partnership with Capsule, members can see what drugs will cost ahead of time, and get their prescriptions fulfilled online. They can sort providers by rankings, read reviews from other members, and book online.

For providers, it means faster payments. For Oscar, it means less human time spent dealing with faxed claims. It&#8217;s an important piece of Oscar&#8217;s infrastructure, but it&#8217;s not sexy, so we can move on for now. It&#8217;ll become more important in a minute.&nbsp;</p><p>All told, Oscar has built a natively integrated, value-based health insurance company that boosts engagement, and by doing so, lets Oscar control costs and improve outcomes over time.&nbsp;</p><p>That was a major investment in technology to serve just one insurer that serves just 0.16% of the country&#8217;s insured population, though&#8230; kind of like Amazon&#8217;s servers and all of the custom tooling they built around them were a bit much for one ecommerce company.&nbsp;</p><p>So if at this point you believe that the tech Oscar&#8217;s built fundamentally improves the insurance business, <strong>the mega-bull case is that hospital systems, care providers, and even other insurers will believe it too, enough to adopt +Oscar for themselves.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The <strong>second part of the master plan</strong> is to unbundle everything they&#8217;ve built and offer it to others in the healthcare system as a flexible, modular tech platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>+Oscar: The Insurance-Enabled Tech Platform</strong></h3><p>The big trend behind Oscar&#8217;s success in the insurance business was the move towards the individualization and consumerization of healthcare, triggered by the ACA. They nailed that one and rode it to a $7+ billion IPO.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, there&#8217;s another trend happening in healthcare more broadly that Oscar is perfectly suited to power, and capture: the <strong>shift towards value-based care and increased risk sharing</strong> with the hospital systems and providers themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>On a long enough time horizon, everyone wants to become a subscription business, and hospital systems are no different. Instead of relying solely on the fee-for-service model, hospital systems are beginning to move towards a model in which they take the risk, and keep the rewards. It&#8217;s <strong>healthcare&#8217;s own shift from labor to capital</strong> that we&#8217;re seeing everywhere else in the market.&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, everyone wants to be Kaiser Permanente.</p><div id="youtube2-Ppwxcj8evC8" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;Ppwxcj8evC8&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:&quot;182&quot;,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ppwxcj8evC8?start=182&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>I gotta admit, when the movie came out, I thought that Kaiser Permanente was an agriculture company. Turns out, it&#8217;s an integrated managed care consortium made up of for-profit and non-profit entities that operates the full stack of healthcare services, from insurance to hospitals to ambulances to physician networks. It has 12.5 million members, and in Q2 2021, it brought in <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/hospitals/kaiser-permanente-posts-3b-profits-q2-as-membership-health-plan-increases#:~:text=The%20revenue%20was%20slightly%20above,the%20second%20quarter%20of%202020.">$3 billion in profits</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, <strong>more health systems want to be like Kaiser Permanente, offering their own insurance plans to patients and shifting to a value-based care model that better aligns them with their patients&#8217; outcomes and gives them more control over their own destiny</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>But, as you might have picked up from the last section, building out a modern insurance company is a lot of work and takes the technical and design chops that most healthcare systems don&#8217;t have in-house, and probably couldn&#8217;t even hire in this environment.&nbsp;</p><p>So in 2018, in partnership with the prestigious Cleveland Clinic, Oscar launched what would become <strong>+Oscar, its tech platform for health systems and other insurers</strong>. +Oscar takes everything that Oscar has built over the past decade -- the risk engine and payment engine, virtual care delivery, population health management, campaign management, Care Teams, and engagement tools --&nbsp; and delivers it as a set of APIs and services to partners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;No health insurance company can grow by itself to cover all 350 million Americans,&#8221; Josh explained, &#8220;it would be impossible to scale because of the licenses, capital reserves, and networks it would require.&#8221; It&#8217;s equally difficult for hospital systems to become insurers, Josh said. &#8220;Building a claims system is hard. Building consumer engagement is really hard. Claims adjudication is really hard.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>So Oscar is attempting to pull off an Amazon </strong><em><strong>and</strong></em><strong> a Shopify at the same time: it&#8217;s arming the rebels by offering a set of health insurance primitives that it had to build for itself as first and best customer.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cd970c3-14eb-4654-89db-56af62484ee0_1600x233.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cd970c3-14eb-4654-89db-56af62484ee0_1600x233.png" width="1100" height="160" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7cd970c3-14eb-4654-89db-56af62484ee0_1600x233.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:160,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cd970c3-14eb-4654-89db-56af62484ee0_1600x233.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cd970c3-14eb-4654-89db-56af62484ee0_1600x233.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cd970c3-14eb-4654-89db-56af62484ee0_1600x233.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cd970c3-14eb-4654-89db-56af62484ee0_1600x233.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>To date, its three biggest partnerships show the breadth of the potential markets it&#8217;s able to serve.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.hioscar.com/clevelandclinic">Cleveland Clinic + Oscar</a></strong>, the company&#8217;s first partnership when it launched in 2018, serves both the individual and group markets.

The plan is tailor-made for the population it serves, offering things unique to the 65+ population including $0 home health care services and $0 rides to doctors appointments and pharmacies.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa742eb25-76c8-41e4-97eb-c269b62b4207_1093x441.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa742eb25-76c8-41e4-97eb-c269b62b4207_1093x441.png" width="1093" height="441" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a742eb25-76c8-41e4-97eb-c269b62b4207_1093x441.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:441,&quot;width&quot;:1093,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa742eb25-76c8-41e4-97eb-c269b62b4207_1093x441.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa742eb25-76c8-41e4-97eb-c269b62b4207_1093x441.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa742eb25-76c8-41e4-97eb-c269b62b4207_1093x441.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa742eb25-76c8-41e4-97eb-c269b62b4207_1093x441.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Montefiore + Oscar</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>The beauty of the Cleveland Clinic and Montefiore partnerships is that they allow the hospital systems to make money for providing better care, not just for providing services. Cleveland Clinic is one of the top medical systems in the country, and Montefiore is one of the top systems serving the Medicare population, and they want to be financially rewarded for that quality without having to rebuild all of the systems that Oscar&#8217;s had to over the past decade.&nbsp;</p><p>Just this month, Oscar launched HealthFirst +Oscar to go deeper into Medicare Advantage and Medicaid by partnering with the insurer on roughly 60,000 members. The beauty of the HealthFirst and Cigna partnerships is that they allow the insurers to offer their members better service, and allow them to serve members they otherwise may not be able to, while giving Oscar a toehold in large segments of the market &#8211; like small group, Medicare, and Medicaid &#8211; that it doesn&#8217;t serve with its core insurance business.&nbsp;</p><p>Like Amazon with AWS (and <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/lithics-new-customer">Lithic</a>), Oscar built tech capabilities for itself, and then realized that other players in the ecosystem would be willing to pay to use their tech in a more modular way. Each partner that works with Oscar can choose to have Oscar power their whole stack, build custom plans, or choose a la carte from the four +Oscar components:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Acquire Risk. </strong>This is essentially sales and marketing, which Oscar is well-suited to as a digitally native company. With Montefiore, for example, Oscar powers renewals and recommends plans to members based on their previous usage.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Member Engagement. </strong>Partners can white-label Oscar&#8217;s digital experience, offer virtual care, and even use its Care Teams to coordinate members&#8217; care. Everything described in the last section can also be made available to +Oscar members.</p></li><li><p><strong>Campaigning and Campaign Building. </strong>Partners can tap into campaigns that Oscar has already run that have proven successful, and can use its campaign builder to create their own. Montefiore members might have very different needs and respond differently to incentives than Cleveland Clinic members, and each can design campaigns, on their own or with Oscar&#8217;s guidance, to incentivize actions that lead to better long-term outcomes.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>System of Record and Administration</strong>. Health systems want to get into the risk business, but they probably don&#8217;t want to get into the claims processing business. Even if they want to handle all other aspects of care themselves, they can still use Oscar&#8217;s claims system on its own to make that part of the process easier.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>Partners can essentially take advantage of these simple layers, or they can dial it up and get creative. For example, one system might design plans specifically for people with diabetes that incentivizes healthy eating, another might design a plan for people with sleep issues that comes with a free Calm subscription, Oura ring, and blue light glasses.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>When the people providing the care are also the people paying for it, they&#8217;re incentivized to design plans that improve health outcomes and lower total cost of care over a patient&#8217;s lifetime. +Oscar gives them the tools to get as creative and specific as they want to be.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In that sense, Oscar is arming the rebels, like Shopify. There are smaller hospital systems across the country that are doing billions of dollars in revenue, who want to take risk and become value-based providers, but don&#8217;t have the tech or underwriting wherewithal to do it. Oscar can help.&nbsp;</p><p>Oscar wants to give all of them the tools that they need to make that transition, and <strong>build hundreds of insurance businesses custom designed for the populations they serve to take on the big, fee-for-service incumbents that dominate the industry today</strong>.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Putting Together the Puzzle</strong></h3><p>Health insurance in the US, as it stands today, is a mess. Expensive, confusing, misaligned.&nbsp;</p><p>But the incumbents have something that no startup can, which happens to be incredibly important in insurance: scale.&nbsp;</p><p>One argument against Oscar, and other health insurtech companies, is that insurance is insurance, and the big insurers are too tough to compete with. They&#8217;re too big. UnitedHealth is 73x larger than Oscar, having written $176.7 billion in direct premiums in 2020, good for a 14.1% market share.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&#8217;ve been reading this newsletter for a while, you know that that&#8217;s not a belief that I subscribe to. I&#8217;m more of a &#8220;software is eating the world&#8221; person.</p><p>In <em><a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/the-model-of-everything">The Model of Everything</a>,</em> I wrote that, &#8220;After writing about NexHealth and now ScienceIO, I&#8217;m convinced that <strong>healthcare will see the kind of change in the next decade that fintech has in the last one</strong>.&#8221; A little over a decade ago, the banks were too big to compete with; now, fintech players are stealing meaningful market share. Today, the health insurers are too big to compete with, but Oscar is growing and stealing share.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether Oscar is ultimately able to disrupt health insurance and build a huge, profitable business comes down to three questions:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p>Is its technology useful in engaging and retaining members and giving them better health outcomes at a lower cost over their lifetimes?&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Will hospital systems and other care providers partner with Oscar to capture the upside associated with better care?</p></li><li><p>Will those partnerships add up to the kind of scale that drives down Oscar&#8217;s costs, improves its plans, leads to better outcomes, and lets them compete head-to-head with the big insurers, even in the larger employer market?</p></li></ol><p>The early signs are positive. Oscar&#8217;s members are more engaged. Oscar&#8217;s NPS looks more like a tech company than an insurance company. Before this last quarter, Medical Loss Ratio was improving steadily. Now, health systems are increasingly turning to Oscar in order to take on risk. In addition to successful launches with Cleveland Clinic and Montefiore, Oscar partners with large insurers like Cigna and HealthFirst. Now, they&#8217;re managing a serious Medicare Advantage book in addition to the large and growing individual book and a seedling small group book.</p><p>A decade in, the Oscar flywheel is really beginning to spin. It still requires some pushing, but the beauty of running a technology business is that once it starts spinning fast enough, it can eat everything around it much faster than expected.&nbsp;</p><p>As more healthcare systems start earning more profits by taking risk and aligning their incentives with members, competitors won&#8217;t have a choice but to switch. Oscar can partner with them to grab more of the individual, small group, and Medicare Advantage markets, and it can start going after large group (employer) insurance, the big prize.&nbsp;</p><p>To Mario, it&#8217;s just a matter of sequencing. Maybe you power smaller large group insurers first, or wedge in with Virtual Plans, in which Oscar Medical Group takes direct risk on outcomes, on top of a company&#8217;s UnitedHealth plan. Prove that businesses can save money downstream by working with Oscar. And then in the future, whether in five years or a decade, go head-to-head with the giants.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#8217;s as simple as building a world-class tech-enabled insurance business and then unbundling that tech and delivering it to hospital systems to let them take risk and share in the upside for the great care that they provide, and then leveraging the combined scale of Oscar and its partners to build a better and better health insurance business and tech platform until it eats all of health insurance from the bottom up.&nbsp;</p><p>Large groups are ultimately just large groups of individuals. The real bet that Oscar is making is that from the individual all the way up to the large groups, people expect a better experience than they&#8217;re getting. This happened in SaaS &#8211; the cringely-named &#8220;prosumerization of the enterprise&#8221; with consumer-quality enterprise tools like Slack and Figma. If Oscar can do the same thing to healthcare, even if it takes another decade, $1.5 billion will seem a cheap price to pay.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/damccormick13">Dan</a> for editing, and to Josh, Mario, Jackie, and JoAnna for working with me!</em></p><div><hr></div><p>How did you like this week&#8217;s Not Boring?

Investors and employees are pulling more money out than they put in by the second-widest margin ever.&nbsp;</p><p>Obviously, that might just mean that, fueled by low interest rates and an active money printer, the public markets are behaving as irrationally optimistically as the private ones. As rates rise, like it looks like they might, it will be interesting to see what happens to private valuations and exit opportunities. But you need to play the game on the field.&nbsp;</p><p>Some Not Boring Capital funds will invest in bull markets, and I&#8217;m sure that others will invest through bear markets. I can&#8217;t wait. The long-term thesis &#8211; that <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/compounding-crazy">tech will compound to unimaginable heights</a> &#8211; remains the same in any market environment until proven otherwise, and bear market prices will be cheaper.&nbsp;</p><p>The trick is staying alive and being able to raise funds in any environment. To that end, I&#8217;m incredibly lucky to be backed by many of the same investors as <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/introducing-not-boring-capital">Fund I</a>, including many of you, along with some great new investors. The Not Boring Capital family is growing, and <strong>I want more Not Boring people involved</strong>.</p><p>The SEC imposes limits on that &#8211; like the (absurd but unfortunately hard) accredited investor rule and the rule that says you can either raise more than $10M with fewer than 100 Limited Partners (LPs, the people who invest in funds) or raise less than $10M from up to 249 LPs.&nbsp;</p><p>For Fund I, we hit the $9.9M cap with 133&nbsp; LPs - a lot for a small fund, but not as many as I&#8217;d like!&nbsp;</p><p>After deploying the $9.9M Fund I in six months, I wanted to go bigger for Fund II: more money to invest, and more LPs. So I worked with the one and only <a href="https://twitter.com/JennJordache">Jenn Jordache</a> at AngelList to set up a parallel fund structure &#8211; which puts all of the Qualified Purchasers ($5M+ in invested assets) in one fund and leaves more room in the $10M / 249 person fund for accredited investors.&nbsp;</p><p>Having that room is really important to me. I&#8217;ve asked LPs who wanted to write bigger checks to keep them smaller and turned down introductions to people who aren&#8217;t Not Boring readers.&nbsp;</p><p>I&#8217;ve said it before and I&#8217;ll say it again: <strong>there wouldn&#8217;t be a Not Boring Capital without all of you reading and sharing and giving feedback on Not Boring</strong>.

But like any industry, VC has a vocabulary and shared understanding that, once you learn them, demystify the whole thing.

There are a lot of familiar faces here, and some new ones &#8211; welcome! This update is going out to LPs in both Fund I and Fund II. Not Boring Capital makes the most sense when you think about it as one (hopefully long) line of connected funds.&nbsp;</p><p>Let&#8217;s kick this update off with some good news, and some bad news.&nbsp;</p><p>First, the bad news: <strong>we&#8217;ve slowed down our pace</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>After making 59 investments in Q3, we only <strong>made 48 investments out of Fund II in Q4</strong> &#128521; We invested <strong>$8.4 million </strong>for an average $175k per investment.&nbsp;</p><p>This seems to be about the right pace for Not Boring Capital. As you&#8217;ll see below, we&#8217;ve been able to keep our bar high while investing bigger checks in more companies, even as we&#8217;ve moved our mix a little bit earlier. Over time, I expect the average check to get a little bigger (the committed pipeline for Q1 averages $290k) and the proportion of follow-ons to increase, which will keep the number of new companies in each fund from ballooning too high.</p><p>Now the good news: <strong>we&#8217;ve already had our first Fund II liquidity event</strong>!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>[REDACTED] </strong>$250k <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>. Our position is currently worth <strong>$3.8 million</strong>, <strong>up 15x for an IRR of around 6.7 billion %</strong> (haha, but actually).&nbsp;</p><p><em>Note: I unfortunately can&#8217;t share details on this one yet.&nbsp;</em></p><p>This one seems like a weird outlier, and it is, but I think it&#8217;s also a really good representation of the fund strategy in action.

Speaking of which&#8230;</p><p>We only started investing 9 months ago, in April, and the average age of our investments is 5 months, but we&#8217;re already starting to see some early results, with <strong>ten markups (</strong>priced or SAFE<strong>)</strong> and a token offering (<a href="https://www.usebraintrust.com/">Braintrust</a>). The largest markup is more than 5x higher than we invested just three months ago. Markups aren&#8217;t cash in the bank, and the market is hot, but it&#8217;s a good start.&nbsp;</p><p>Most of these deals haven&#8217;t been announced yet, but one has: in November, <a href="https://www.protocol.com/party-round-startup-fundraising-tool">a16z led a $7M Seed in Party Round</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>We&#8217;ve also seen our <strong>first markdown</strong>, but it&#8217;s one that I&#8217;m actually excited about. After struggling to raise a large round, the founder decided to recapitalize the business and refocus on product and a self-serve GTM motion. I was incredibly impressed with how he handled the whole process, and with the new plan, so we participated in the recap out of Fund II alongside existing investors. Where it shakes out is that we own a larger position in a more focused and re-energized business. More details to come in future updates when this is more public.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, we have a handful of portfolio companies somewhere between kicking off fundraising and signed term sheets.&nbsp;</p><p>Since Fund I is now fully deployed, this will be the last time it gets its own section, and we&#8217;ll move to having a markups section that spans funds for future updates.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Fund II Portfolio Stats&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As a reminder, Fund II will be a $30M fund running a similar strategy to Fund I but with larger check sizes, more follow-ons as Fund I companies break out, and the benefit of a fund&#8217;s worth of wisdom under our belt.

For example, it can help artists better price songs to fill up the dead space under the demand curve (not everyone values each song at $0.99 or some fraction of $9.99/month), form stronger connections with their biggest fans, and get paid.

As we&#8217;ve discussed many times in Not Boring, NFTs have exploded over the past year, with 10s of billions of dollars in volume. <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/129250/opensea-eyeing-raise-that-would-value-it-at-13-billion-with-backing-from-coatue-and-paradigm-sources">OpenSea was just valued above $13 billion</a>. If you think NFTs are just funny, kinda overvalued digital art pieces, that deal alone would make you scratch your head. If you think, like I do, that art is just an easy-to-grasp, and ultimately pretty small, first use case, then there are going to be many, many multi-billion dollar businesses built around NFTs as a new asset class and primitive.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.bridgesplit.com/">Bridgesplit</a></strong>, started by two genius Duke founders, <a href="https://twitter.com/TruittLuke">Luke</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/marygooneratne">Mary</a>, is building a bridge between NFTs and DeFi, letting owners fractionalize their NFTs, create indexes, and borrow against them. That&#8217;s a pretty big opportunity with art NFTs, but a hugely important set of tools as more things become backed by NFTs. In just three months, Bridgesplit launched its devnet with over 1,500 fractionalized NFTs, signed exclusive partnerships with top Solana NFT projects including <a href="https://twitter.com/MonkeDAO/status/1467910467515404294?s=20">MonkeDAO</a>, and launched a new financial primitive: <a href="https://twitter.com/bridgesplit/status/1479204962957725703?s=20">Curated Indexes</a>.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95079ad9-1cc0-4af1-a80f-58d8564ab771_1600x285.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95079ad9-1cc0-4af1-a80f-58d8564ab771_1600x285.png" width="1100" height="196" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/95079ad9-1cc0-4af1-a80f-58d8564ab771_1600x285.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:196,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95079ad9-1cc0-4af1-a80f-58d8564ab771_1600x285.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95079ad9-1cc0-4af1-a80f-58d8564ab771_1600x285.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95079ad9-1cc0-4af1-a80f-58d8564ab771_1600x285.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95079ad9-1cc0-4af1-a80f-58d8564ab771_1600x285.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Bridgesplit: End-to-End Financial Infrastructure for NFTs</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>In the same vein, <strong><a href="https://app.abacus.wtf/">Abacus</a></strong> is an NFT appraisal protocol that&#8217;s generated strong early traction.

On the surface, the investment seemed like an anomaly, something that would be incredibly hard to replicate. But as I thought about it, <strong>the investment was a direct result of the fund strategy</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>It was weird. When I told other investors about it, most of them turned it down. If it had gone wrong, I probably would have looked like an idiot. If I were only making 20, or even 50, investments out of the fund, there&#8217;s almost no chance I would have done it.&nbsp;</p><p>But since we&#8217;ll be making around 100 investments per fund, we have more room to get weird and make bets that others might not. We&#8217;ll have more investments go to $0 than other funds, but the hope is that we&#8217;ll catch more of the companies and projects with outlier upside returns than other funds, too.&nbsp;</p><p>We have a lot of advantages as a small, nimble fund with a solo GP and a non-institutional LP base. I talked about a lot of them in the <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/playing-solo-games">last update</a>. One of the ones I didn&#8217;t mention, but that I think is key, is that <strong>we can (and should) make riskier, weirder investments than other funds</strong> can (even if they should).&nbsp;</p><p>That might mean fund investments in silly-seeming DAOs. It might mean more investments in climate. It might mean things with more regulatory risk that most entrepreneurs and investors wouldn&#8217;t want to touch.&nbsp;</p><p>VCs have gotten a bad rap recently. I think (and I&#8217;m obviously biased here) that most of it is undeserved. At its best, VCs funnel resources to the risky projects that no other capital source could or would touch. It&#8217;s only when those weird bets pay off that it looks like the VCs were greedy all along.&nbsp;</p><p>Bringing up Solana has become an LP Update email tradition, but it&#8217;s illustrative here once again. In <em><a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/solana-summer">Solana Summer</a></em>, I wrote about the challenge that Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko had raising money in 2017:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>It wasn&#8217;t obvious back then that this would work. One VC I spoke with showed me a calendar invite for a December 2017 coffee meeting with Anatoly to discuss the project. After the coffee, he passed. There was a lot of competition to be the next big blockchain. This VC told me, &#8220;You had Dfinity, Polkadot, Tezos, and Cosmos, all of which had lots of hype and lots of funding.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Some crypto funds saw the vision and committed, but by the time wires were due, the crypto markets started to crumble. <strong>All of Solana&#8217;s would-be backers pulled out.</strong>&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>Today, with Solana&#8217;s fully diluted market cap sitting at $70 billion, one of the biggest knocks against it is that it&#8217;s VC-owned and that the VCs behind Solana are just in it to pump and dump. That&#8217;s bullshit. The bet that funds like Race Capital and Multicoin made back in 2018, in the middle of crypto winter and a sea of on-paper-stronger competitors, was so far from a sure thing as to be insanely weird and risky. Without their money, Solana may never have gotten off the ground or developed the thriving ecosystem it is today. They&#8217;ve been appropriately rewarded for being weird and right.&nbsp;</p><p>Even as the markets democratize, and individuals are often able to invest in web3 projects at the same time and same terms as VCs (which is an incredible development!), there&#8217;s still an important role for VCs who are willing to put their research, credibility, resources, and piles of money behind the weird, risky stuff that moves the world forward.&nbsp;</p><p>That&#8217;s my goal for Fund II: to <strong>push further out the weirdness and risk curves than I did in Fund I</strong> to help make the wild, amazing stuff happen.</p><p>Join me.

Hope you all enjoyed your holidays, got to relax and recharge a little bit, and, if you live in New York, that your COVID wasn&#8217;t too bad.&nbsp;</p><p>Last year, for the first piece of the year, I came out swinging with my only-ever <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/bill-a-bear">bear case on Bill.com</a>. I was hilariously wrong on the stock: it opened that morning at $137.46 and a year later, it&#8217;s up 81.25% to $249.15. It handily outperformed the NASDAQ (+22.3%) and the BVP Cloud Index (-1.8%). It grew revenue 151.9% last year, faster than any other BVP Cloud Index company by far (Snowflake is second at 109.5%). Just clobbered me.&nbsp;</p><p>I learned a few lessons from that:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p>Never underestimate strong distribution, even in the face of a shitty product.</p></li><li><p>Kick the year off optimistically.</p></li></ol><p>And whew, there&#8217;s a lot to cover!

Waldrop wrote the book thirty years ago, in 1992. It&#8217;s not new enough to be expressly written for the next decade, and not old enough to sit among the timeless classics that work in <em>any</em> decade. But the crowds are wise; it was an excellent pick.</p><p><em>Complexity</em> tells the early history of <strong>complex systems science</strong> through the stories of the founders of the <a href="https://www.santafe.edu/">Santa Fe Institute</a><em> </em>(SFI)<em>, </em>&#8220;a research institute in Santa Fe that is devoted to the study of complexity in all its forms.&#8221; Thirty years later, SFI is still running and complex systems science is still relevant. In October, the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2021/prize-announcement/">2021 Nobel Prize in Physics</a> went to three scientists, &#8220;For <strong>groundbreaking contributions to our understanding of complex systems</strong>"<em> </em>used to create more accurate models of the effect of global warming on the climate.</p><p><strong>Complex systems</strong> are everywhere, from the climate to the human brain to the power grid to the economy to the beginning of life on this planet from the primordial stew of molecules. They&#8217;re devilishly hard to capture in models and differential equations, but crucially important to understand.&nbsp;</p><p>Before complex systems science, the prevailing approach to understanding these complex systems was <strong>reductionism:</strong> breaking them down into their component parts and trying to build a complete picture by adding together each piece. Challenge is, complex systems do all sorts of things that can&#8217;t be predicted by looking at each piece. They&#8217;re emergent: the whole is greater, and different, than the sum of its parts.&nbsp;</p><p><em>(Incidentally, I think many of the anti-web3 arguments miss by being overly reductionist.&nbsp; I&#8217;m actually pretty sure the midwit meme is just reductionism vs. complexity.)</em></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d2a2292-439c-4ca0-bc8a-d1d877f4e39b_1600x914.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d2a2292-439c-4ca0-bc8a-d1d877f4e39b_1600x914.png" width="1100" height="628" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5d2a2292-439c-4ca0-bc8a-d1d877f4e39b_1600x914.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:628,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d2a2292-439c-4ca0-bc8a-d1d877f4e39b_1600x914.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d2a2292-439c-4ca0-bc8a-d1d877f4e39b_1600x914.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d2a2292-439c-4ca0-bc8a-d1d877f4e39b_1600x914.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d2a2292-439c-4ca0-bc8a-d1d877f4e39b_1600x914.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Take economics. The economics that I studied in college, except for one frisky Behavioral Economics course, assumes that &#8220;economic man&#8221; is perfectly rational and seeks to fit the economy into a series of differential equations and supply-demand curves on top of those assumptions. It seeks equilibrium. It&#8217;s mathematically elegant, all fits together, and&#8230; is pretty much entirely disconnected from reality.&nbsp;</p><p>The real economy, like most complex systems, doesn&#8217;t reach equilibrium. It evolves, based on the actions, rational and irrational, of its billions of individual participants.&nbsp;</p><p>Grokking the status quo&#8217;s shortcomings, and armed with the heretical idea of increasing returns &#8211; a concept familiar to all of us in tech today but much less accepted in the early 1980s &#8211; Stanford economist Brian Arthur set out to create a new economic framework at Santa Fe.&nbsp;</p><p>The stakes were more than academic. The world was coming out of a painful period of stagflation in the 1970s that called into question the Keynesians&#8217; ability to stabilize the economy. A more realistic economic framework would help policymakers and financiers design interventions that would stimulate growth and employment, stabilize the market, and better achieve the goals of their fiscal and monetary programs.&nbsp;</p><p>So instead of differential equations based on assumptions, Arthur proposed agent-based simulations:</p><blockquote><p><em>I had this notion that you could have within your office in the university <strong>a little peasant economy developing under a bubble of glass</strong>. Of course, it would really be in a computer. But it would have to be all these little agents, preprogrammed to get smart and interact with each other.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Then in this dreamlike idea, you&#8217;d go in one morning and say, &#8216;Hey, look at these guys! Two or three weeks ago all they were doing was bartering and now they&#8217;ve got joint stock companies.&#8217; Then the next day you&#8217;d come in and say, &#8216;Oh &#8211; they&#8217;ve discovered central banking.&#8217; Then a few days later you&#8217;d have all your colleagues clustered around you and you&#8217;re peering in: &#8216;Wow!

Depending on how you value them, both CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club have total market caps (# of NFTs * price per NFT) of around $3 billion each. More than just a disconnected network of owners, though, the humans behind the NFT PFP formed communities, online and IRL. First, they met in Discords. Then, they met in-person, at Ape-only events at NFT NYC and Art Basel. They&#8217;ve even discussed plans to open up a hotel for Ape owners only.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, according to Punk 4156, those communities of people that have come together based on ownership of similar expensive jpegs will start pooling money and investing in <em>other</em> things together. They&#8217;ll compete with crypto VCs, using access to the community as potential customers, liquidity providers, and advocates as a competitive edge.&nbsp;</p><p>Brian Arthur would be proud.

Both are about complex, atoms-based challenges that we won&#8217;t be able to solve with software alone: curing disease and fixing the planet.&nbsp;</p><p>In <em>Ministry for the Future</em>, the solution that the titular Ministry devises to the rapidly worsening climate crisis circa 2030 is a carbon-backed global reserve currency, supported by all the world&#8217;s central banks, with a guaranteed payout over time. It was a way, the Minister argued, to &#8220;go long humanity.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>Life imitates art. We&#8217;ve talked about <a href="https://www.klimadao.finance/">$KLIMA</a> here before, the &#8220;carbon-backed algorithmic digital currency&#8221; that wants to be a black hole for carbon offsets, making it more expensive to buy offsets, and therefore to pollute. <a href="https://gitcoin.co/grants/4119/the-eden-dao-unfing-the-planet">EdenDAO</a> wants to apply a similar mechanism to &#8220;future&#8221; carbon removals and reductions.&nbsp;</p><p>I get to cheat a little bit here, too. Investing in early stage startups lets me glimpse the future. Over the break, I invested in one company working to help a group with a large environmental footprint reduce that footprint using data science, NFTs, and a liquid, open market. I committed to another that&#8217;s using a Parent-Child DAO structure to hopefully save lives. (Those are both painfully vague descriptions, but they&#8217;re both in stealth so that&#8217;s all I can say).&nbsp;</p><p>Both have taken bits and pieces from objectively silly past DAO and NFT projects and are applying them in really smart ways. Both understand the fact that open, liquid, global capital markets are a hugely important piece of the puzzle. Neither resorts to high-minded language.&nbsp;</p><p>They&#8217;ve simply watched the simulations, learned, and taken those learnings to tackle really big challenges. This is why they&#8217;ll succeed where previous attempts to &#8220;put X physical thing on the blockchain&#8221; have failed. It&#8217;s not about the blockchain. It&#8217;s about the simulations.&nbsp;</p><p>Those simulations &#8211; played out over thousands of iterations, millions of transactions, and billions of dollars &#8211; tell us that greed can be good, that speculation can serve a purpose, that memes have value, and that people are willing to spend money to be part of something bigger than themselves (particularly if there&#8217;s the potential for a return).&nbsp;</p><p>The fun part about this is that all of it matters: whether you&#8217;re trying to solve world hunger, just fucking around and trying some new mechanism, or aping into a project because you like the art, you&#8217;re feeding the simulation, adding tools to the toolkit, and pushing future projects forward. </p><p>That&#8217;s the thing I&#8217;m most excited about in 2022: to see all this wacky, wild stuff we&#8217;ve been up to online turn into solutions to complex physical challenges. </p><div><hr></div><p>How did you like this week&#8217;s Not Boring?

I was thinking about continuing to write through the holidays, or at least stretching out and grabbing one more week, making one final push to get to 100k subscribers before year end. But as I went back and forth, Puja gave me some sage advice:&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;Just fucking call it, dude.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>2021 has been the most unbelievable year of my life.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/dad-life">Dev</a> turned into a real human. Puja and I moved back to Brooklyn. There are more than three times as many of you here as there were this time last year. I launched a venture fund and have backed over 100 companies that are building the future. I went deep, deep down the web3 rabbit hole, tried to buy the Constitution with friends, and joined a16z crypto as an advisor. I&#8217;ve made so many smart, curious internet friends.&nbsp;</p><p>If you had told me on New Year&#8217;s Day 2021 that this would be what the year would hold, I wouldn&#8217;t have believed you. </p><p>Thank you to all of you for giving me a little bit of your time, attention, trust, and thoughts in 2021. I know you&#8217;re pulled in a million different directions and that there are infinite exciting things for you to explore. It means a lot that you take the time to read, listen to, share, and engage with Not Boring.&nbsp;</p><p>I don&#8217;t want it to end.&nbsp;</p><p>But it&#8217;s also been the most exhausting year of my life. Between writing, investing, tweeting, and dadding, I&#8217;ve pretty much been on 24/7 since the beginning of January.&nbsp;</p><p>I&#8217;ve written, and fully believe, that things will only continue to get crazier and faster from here. That applies globally and locally. If 2022 is going to be a wilder ride than 2021 has been, I need to get some rest. I need to recharge, reflect, read, and take a beat to plan out the year ahead. If the past year&#8217;s pace is indicative of what the future holds, pausing is going to be a crucially important skill.&nbsp;</p><p>So it&#8217;s time to call it.&nbsp;</p><p>Justttttt one last quick piece before we do.&nbsp;</p><p>Let&#8217;s get to it.</p><div><hr></div><h1>The Best is Still Yet to Come</h1><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cc30237-6f6f-4c2b-9925-5f02887a6376_1200x600.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cc30237-6f6f-4c2b-9925-5f02887a6376_1200x600.png" width="1100" height="550" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1cc30237-6f6f-4c2b-9925-5f02887a6376_1200x600.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:550,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:72172,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cc30237-6f6f-4c2b-9925-5f02887a6376_1200x600.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cc30237-6f6f-4c2b-9925-5f02887a6376_1200x600.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cc30237-6f6f-4c2b-9925-5f02887a6376_1200x600.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cc30237-6f6f-4c2b-9925-5f02887a6376_1200x600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>&#127926; It&#8217;s the most funniest time of the yearrrrr &#127926;</p><p>It&#8217;s that time of year when people like me fire up their laptops, open a blank Google doc, look back on everything that&#8217;s happened over the past year, and boldly extrapolate into the next.&nbsp;</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm/status/1470148778233638913?s=20&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;it&#8217;s that time of the year when VCs post their cringe predictions for 2022&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;Flynnjamm&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Brian Flynn (hiring in bio)&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Sun Dec 12 21:49:17 +0000 2021&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:5,&quot;like_count&quot;:84,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null}"><a href="https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm/status/1470148778233638913?s=20" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-user-avatar" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/twitter_name/w_36/Flynnjamm.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @Flynnjamm"><span class="tweet-author-name">Brian Flynn (hiring in bio) </span><span class="tweet-author">@Flynnjamm</span></div>it&#8217;s that time of the year when VCs post their cringe predictions for 2022</a><a href="https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm/status/1470148778233638913?s=20" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-footer"><p class="tweet-date">December 12th 2021</p><span class="retweets"><span class="rt-count">5</span> Retweets</span><span class="likes"><span class="like-count">84</span> Likes</span></div></a></div><p>We mainly use the opportunity to pump our bags, financial or otherwise. &#8220;You know that thing that I care about / write about / invested in?&#8221; we ask. &#8220;Well, that thing is going to be <em><strong>even bigger and more important</strong></em> next year.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>And <strong>we&#8217;re almost always wrong</strong>. Or at least, we&#8217;re not right enough and definitely not right precisely.&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine confidently typing up predictions for 2020 at the end of 2019. Best case, they looked good for about two months. &#8220;We write annual prediction emails and God laughs.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>I didn&#8217;t even land within an order of magnitude of my predictions for <em>myself</em> when I <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/per-my-last-e-mail-32">set goals in Per My Last E-mail #23 on January 1, 2020</a>: &#8220;<strong>Get to 1,000 subscribers and build a community</strong>.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>By the end of 2020, though, I had the benefit of knowing that COVID was a thing, and of spending nearly an entire year just writing, investing, and talking to smart people. Surely, my 2021 predictions were spot-on, right?&nbsp;</p><p>Ehhhh&#8230; In <em><a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/the-best-is-yet-to-come">The Best is Yet to Come</a></em> last December, I highlighted three themes that made me bullish on the year ahead in tech:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p><strong>The Markets Are Eating Up Technology.</strong> Bubble or not, more funding would lead to more innovation.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Cloud Companies. Remote work + liquid work + software would make it easier to spin up and grow companies with the best people from around the globe.&nbsp;</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The Passion Economy Writ Large. More people would start working for themselves, and more self-employed people would make the economy more resilient to future shocks.</strong></p></li></ol><p>I&#8217;m as optimistic as they come. I literally started that piece by writing: &#8220;I&#8217;ve always been an optimist. It&#8217;s how I&#8217;m wired. My brain has a very hard time visualizing the downsides, and a very easy time visualizing the upsides.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>And still, somehow, <strong>I wasn&#8217;t optimistic enough</strong>. I missed web3.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2021, crypto, NFTs, DAOs, and DeFi hyperturbosupercharged each of the themes that I thought were going to shape 2021. A year later, those crypto-less predictions seem quaint.&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p><strong>The Markets Are Eating Up Technology.</strong> Last year, I mainly wrote about the equity market&#8217;s insatiable demand for tech stocks. I missed that web3 would create a global, liquid market for everything from culture to the <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/lets-buy-the-us-constitution">Constitution</a>.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Cloud Companies. </strong>Remote is here to stay, and entrepreneurs can spin up companies faster than ever thanks to the availability of better and better software primitives. I fell short though, by not anticipating the rise of DAOs, the Great Resignation, or the full force of the <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/the-cooperation-economy-">Cooperation Economy</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Passion Economy Writ Large. </strong>I wrote about the potential of passion economy platforms like TikTok, Discord, Substack, and OnlyFans, but I missed creators&#8217; ability to build direct economic relationships with fans and shift from labor to capital. I also missed just how big an umbrella the word creator covers. <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/power-to-the-person">Power to the Person</a>.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>All to say, if I missed the biggest game changer of 2021 in my predictions last December, you shouldn&#8217;t take any of my 2022 predictions this December very seriously. So I won&#8217;t make any, other than this:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>If you thought that 2021 was wild, 2022 will make it look normal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Over the past year, everything in our corner of the world got bigger, faster.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Prior to 2021, venture funding never reached $100B in a single quarter. <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/q3-2021-global-venture-capital-report-record-funding-monthly-recap/">This year</a>, it&#8217;s <strong>exceeded $100B every quarter</strong>.

It&#8217;s impossible to predict exactly <em>what</em> people are going to create with the primitives &#8211; software, hardware, and ideas &#8211; at their disposal. The distributed hive mind of millions of entrepreneurs will dream things up that no one person could.

Being optimistic shouldn&#8217;t just mean sitting passively by and waiting for good things to happen. But how do you orient and act in a world that&#8217;s moving and evolving so quickly?&nbsp;</p><p>I&#8217;ve written about <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/two-ways-to-predict-the-future">Worldbuilders</a> a lot here &#8211; people who predict something non-obvious about the way the world is moving, create a seemingly small wedge into a much larger opportunity, timestamp their vision, and then execute patiently but aggressively to make it a reality. The worldbuilders we&#8217;ve covered are people like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and the founders of unicorn startups, but I think <strong>the same thing works for regular people like us.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Formulate a decade-long view of where everything is heading, where you want it to head, and what role you&#8217;re best-suited to play in making that happen</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>This past year was a blast. People jumped from project to project, from mint to mint, from DAO to DAO. It was a year during which <strong>experimentation was the purpose</strong>. It was a lot of fun.&nbsp;</p><p>But, at least for me, it also meant that there was less time to think longer-term and to get more deeply involved in a few projects working towards things that will take more than a few weeks to play out. <strong>As things move faster and faster, it&#8217;s more and more important to hit pause, evaluate, and plan.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Personally, I&#8217;m going to read a lot, write thoughts not meant for public consumption, put some systems in place, and try to anchor myself to a longer-term vision of where the world is heading and how I can best contribute.&nbsp;</p><p>That will be a loose guide. When the madness starts back up in January, I&#8217;ll try to act like a <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference">Bayesian</a></strong>, tethered to my priors but updating my understanding and approach as I receive new information. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m not making any annual predictions: <strong>a year is both too short and too long a time frame for me to have conviction</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>So I&#8217;m not setting anything in stone, but I think that having a longer-term view will help me pick and choose among the myriad paths that spring up every day. I&#8217;ll probably say &#8220;yes&#8221; to fewer things next year, but go in more deeply on those yeses.&nbsp;</p><p>Each of your approaches will be totally different. Many of you are probably already working towards that thing you want to come true in a decade; maybe you need a little more experimentation to keep yourself fresh. Others know that you&#8217;re not doing what you want to be doing; it&#8217;s probably time to evaluate, adjust, and start taking steps towards changing that. Some, like me, are doing too many things and might benefit from a more stable north star.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever you do, approach all of the novelty out there with an <strong>open mind</strong>. You can be skeptical, of course, but be curiously skeptical. <strong>Don&#8217;t default to cynicism</strong>, and don&#8217;t dismiss new things out of hand.&nbsp;</p><p>New things will seem weird at first, and then those weird things will seem normal, and other, newer things will seem weird, and on and on.&nbsp;</p><p>At some point &#8211; it might be March 2022, December 2029, or April 2069 &#8211; everything that we&#8217;ve created and experienced in 2021 will seem quaint and antiquated. If we&#8217;re lucky, today&#8217;s most out-there ideas and technologies will be tiny building blocks in much larger structures.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course there will be failures along the way. If there aren&#8217;t, we&#8217;re not dreaming big enough. You can choose to point to each stumble and yell, &#8220;I told you so!&#8221; or you can choose to zoom out, applaud the experimentation, and chip in where you can to make the next one better.&nbsp;</p><p>You know which one I&#8217;m choosing.

It&#8217;s a tough one. It&#8217;s hard to capture the full breadth of what Replit is trying to build, and how, and what the world will look like if they succeed. That&#8217;s partially because it&#8217;s impossible to predict, because Replit is in the primitives business. It&#8217;s laying the foundation on top of which one billion people will build the future. After spending hours and hours researching, talking to Replit&#8217;s CEO Amjad Masad, and writing this piece, I&#8217;m convinced that Replit has the potential to be one of the most valuable and impactful companies in the world. But I probably need to explain why, and to do that, I need to just pick a place to start and get going.

Then it can become the first place they build an app, the first place they collaborate on software, the first place they make money online, and ultimately, the place that they turn whenever they want to create software.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#8217;s a straightforward goal with nuanced implications.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, it means <em>not </em>targeting experienced developers to start, even though they&#8217;re the more valuable users today. If they&#8217;ve already written their first line of code elsewhere, they definitionally can&#8217;t write their first line of code in Replit.&nbsp;</p><p>It also means that Replit needs to make it really easy to get started by putting everything you need to code something simple in one place, accessible from anywhere in the world with an internet connection whether you&#8217;re on a brand new MacBook Pro, a Chromebook, or even an Android phone.&nbsp;</p><p>And it means making it multiplayer from the beginning, to create a modern development experience that includes collaboration, like people are used to with products like Google Docs and Figma. A networked operating system demands networked development.&nbsp;</p><p>The approach comes with trade-offs. As it stands today, a large company couldn&#8217;t build most of its software in Replit. It&#8217;s more limited than a local setup including best-in-class point-solutions like Microsoft&#8217;s VS Code, Github, Heroku, Docker, AWS, npm, and postgres. It&#8217;s slower. It&#8217;s not industrial-grade. But that&#8217;s not the point.&nbsp;</p><p>Replit wants to build the future, and <strong>to build the future, you don&#8217;t rebuild the old thing for the old customers</strong>. You build something new that starts out <a href="https://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy/">looking like a toy</a>, and you build for the underserved, not just for moral reasons, but for strategic ones. It&#8217;s <strong>disruptive innovation</strong> meets the <strong>compounding power of young users</strong>. It&#8217;s more Roblox than Github. As Replit&#8217;s CEO and co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/amasad">Amjad Masad</a> explained it to me:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>To discover the future, you need a population that will grow up with the technology and partner with you in figuring out where software is heading, how we collaborate, and what the implications of things like web3 and AI will be.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>Partnering and growing with underserved (here: young) customers requires an uncommon patience and focus on the mission. Replit is already a decade old if you count its earliest instantiation as repl.it, an open source project that Amjad built growing up in Jordan. That project led him to Codecademy and Facebook before returning to the original mission and rebooting Replit as a company in 2016. Today, Replit, Inc. is in year five of a multi-decade plan.&nbsp;</p><p>That plan starts with becoming the first place that everyone writes code, and growing with them symbiotically as they grow. That means giving new software creators everything they need to start creating, accessible from anywhere to anyone with a laptop, tablet, or phone.&nbsp;</p><p>It ends with Replit becoming the <strong>world&#8217;s first massively distributed and collaborative operating system</strong>, an open and extensible platform that anyone can build on top of and plug into to improve the platform itself, and make money by doing so. The more people who know how to code, the more people there are to improve the platform, the richer the ecosystem becomes. It&#8217;s a strongly positive sum <strong>network effect</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>When Replit is successful, everyone will be able to <strong>remix the internet</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of the emergent nature of composability, it&#8217;s impossible to predict what Replit will look like in a decade, but it&#8217;s not impossible to predict that the results are going to be special. If the company gets everything just right, I think that it has the chance to be a $100 billion+ company that reshapes the way that software is developed and by whom, and by extension, who can build the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#8217;s a multi-decade vision, and building towards it is going to take a lot of time, money, and smart people. That&#8217;s why today, <strong>Replit is announcing an $80M Series B led by Coatue at an $800M valuation</strong>.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22154d1c-defb-4d02-b617-a86bbfb35b9a_715x1008.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22154d1c-defb-4d02-b617-a86bbfb35b9a_715x1008.png" width="715" height="1008" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/22154d1c-defb-4d02-b617-a86bbfb35b9a_715x1008.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1008,&quot;width&quot;:715,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22154d1c-defb-4d02-b617-a86bbfb35b9a_715x1008.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22154d1c-defb-4d02-b617-a86bbfb35b9a_715x1008.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22154d1c-defb-4d02-b617-a86bbfb35b9a_715x1008.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22154d1c-defb-4d02-b617-a86bbfb35b9a_715x1008.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Actually, I&#8217;m just going to call it: <strong>Replit will be a $100 billion+ company</strong>, but more importantly, its <strong>users will generate multiples of that number in value for themselves</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Not Boring Capital invested in this round and I couldn&#8217;t be more pumped.

Honestly, our fault.&nbsp;</p><p>The early internet, from the 1980s to the early 2000s, was largely <strong>open and decentralized</strong>. It was built on top of a series of open <strong>protocols</strong> that anyone could build directly on top of, like HTTP for websites, SMTP for email, SMS for messaging, IRC for chat, and FTP for file transfer. The benefit was that these protocols were generally agreed upon and not subject to change; I could build a website on HTTP and if people had my website address, they could go directly to my site, not intermediated by anyone else.&nbsp;</p><p>But there were some major challenges, which I covered in <em><a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/the-value-chain-of-the-open-metaverse">The Value Chain of the Open Metaverse</a></em>:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Stateless.</strong> Web 1.0 protocols were stateless, meaning that they didn&#8217;t capture state, or user data. &#8220;Capturing user data&#8221; has negative connotations today, but stateless protocols meant that website owners didn&#8217;t even know whether I&#8217;d visited a site before, and couldn&#8217;t tailor experiences accordingly.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Missing Protocols. </strong>Web 1.0 didn&#8217;t have standard protocols for many of the things that power the internet today: payments, search, apps, social media, commerce, credit, and more.</p></li><li><p><strong>Protocols Didn&#8217;t Make Money!</strong> Imagine developing HTTP, seeing trillions of dollars worth of value being built on top of it, and not being able to participate in the upside aside from some speaking fees, consulting gigs, and book sales. Oof.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Too Technical.</strong> You needed to be technical to build a presence on Web 1.0, which meant that regular people who didn&#8217;t know how to code were left out.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><strong>Web 2.0</strong> (mid-2000s to present) emerged as entrepreneurs recognized the holes in Web 1.0 and built products to fill them in, and capture the value in the process. These companies didn&#8217;t just capture state, they aggregated it, building up huge troves of valuable user data. They made it so that anyone could participate and build a presence -- think about how easy it is to set up a Facebook page versus coding a website. They wrapped existing protocols in frictionless user interfaces and created de facto products where no protocols existed.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4807819b-6f51-4c8f-a4ab-97b2ac4ad985_1456x501.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4807819b-6f51-4c8f-a4ab-97b2ac4ad985_1456x501.png" width="1100" height="379" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4807819b-6f51-4c8f-a4ab-97b2ac4ad985_1456x501.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:379,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4807819b-6f51-4c8f-a4ab-97b2ac4ad985_1456x501.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4807819b-6f51-4c8f-a4ab-97b2ac4ad985_1456x501.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4807819b-6f51-4c8f-a4ab-97b2ac4ad985_1456x501.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4807819b-6f51-4c8f-a4ab-97b2ac4ad985_1456x501.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>We&#8217;ve covered some of the challenges with Web 2.0 in Not Boring, along with some of the ways that web3 might help solve them. In many ways, web3 is Web 1.0 with most of the holes filled:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Shared State.</strong> Blockchains are big databases that capture and retain shared state.</p></li><li><p><strong>New Protocols.</strong> Each new lego is a new protocol that others can snap into.</p></li><li><p><strong>Protocols Can Make Money.</strong> From Bitcoin to Ethereum to Uniswap and beyond, successful web3 protocols can be worth hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>But <strong>one thing that still hasn&#8217;t been solved is that most of us aren&#8217;t technical enough to actually create software</strong>. Fewer than 30 million people in the world know how to code. Anyone can now <em>own </em>the protocols and apps they use, but most of us (certainly me included) still can&#8217;t <em>build</em> them, or build on top of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A truly open, decentralized internet will be one that a billion people can build on and remix and compose, where anyone can interact directly with protocols, APIs, and services, and build protocols, APIs, and services themselves. It will be a world in which people can design their own internet experience, and design software that can succeed not by being 10x better than the existing solutions or 10x bigger than competitors, but by <strong>better serving the millions of small niches that make up the internet</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>The commonly way to describe the evolution of the internet is as follows:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Web 1.0 was read-only</p></li><li><p>Web 2.0 was read-write</p></li><li><p>Web3 is read-write-own&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Ownership is a critical piece, but it kinda breaks the read-write metaphor. The thing that prevents centralization ultimately will be how many people are able to create unmediated homes on the internet directly on top of protocols and shared state. People should be able to fork and build and tinker and tweak to build their own experiences on top of global, decentralized databases. When that happens&#8230;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Web3 will be read-write-remix</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>When I wrote that on Monday, I had Replit in mind. We&#8217;ll talk more about that world in a bit, but I wanted to set the stage with what&#8217;s at stake.&nbsp;</p><p>For now, let&#8217;s go back to the beginning of the story, when Replit was born of a pressing need felt by a young Jordanian hacker.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>From Jordan to Replit</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>It&#8217;s possible that only Amjad Masad could have built Replit. His combination of technical skills and lived experience might be exactly what&#8217;s required to reimagine who gets to create and monetize software, and how, in a world in which talent is equally distributed but opportunity is not, yet.&nbsp;</p><p>Amjad&#8217;s story proves two things:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p>Even ideas that seem inevitable in hindsight are really hard and uncertain in real-time.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Surviving the roller coaster is easier if you&#8217;re focused on a personally important mission.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>Amjad Masad was born in Amman, Jordan. When he was very young, his dad, who was working two full-time jobs, running his own business after coming home from his 9-5 job, bought the family its first computer. Back then, even getting a computer running required a little bit of basic (pun intended) programming, guided by a thick instruction manual, and young Amjad learned as his dad did.&nbsp;</p><p>Amjad&#8217;s childhood looked a lot like Replit&#8217;s product roadmap. By age six, he could do some light programming. By age 12, he was programming in Visual Basic. By age 15, he sold his first piece of software, a LAN gaming center management software, and started a small business to maintain the computers and games at the stores that bought it.&nbsp;</p><p>In high school, he walked a familiar hacker&#8217;s path: originally guided by a teacher who gave him advanced lessons in math and computer science on the side, Amjad became bored and unruly when the teacher left the school and the lessons stopped. His parents made frequent trips to the principal&#8217;s office to bail him out. But he was smart, and he escaped high school.&nbsp;</p><p>For college, Amjad went to Princess Sumaya University for Technology (PSUT), where he once again found himself understimulated and underperforming.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bb0e53f-e86c-4847-8259-6c0352312138_1143x445.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bb0e53f-e86c-4847-8259-6c0352312138_1143x445.png" width="1100" height="428" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5bb0e53f-e86c-4847-8259-6c0352312138_1143x445.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:428,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bb0e53f-e86c-4847-8259-6c0352312138_1143x445.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bb0e53f-e86c-4847-8259-6c0352312138_1143x445.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bb0e53f-e86c-4847-8259-6c0352312138_1143x445.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bb0e53f-e86c-4847-8259-6c0352312138_1143x445.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Princess Sumaya University for Technology</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>According to a 2013 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20130919080958-1326123--young-hungry-and-waiting-to-be-unleashed/">profile</a>, he was dropped from the same calculus class twice, not because he wasn&#8217;t good at math, but because he never showed up. Instead, he was spending his time coding for startups and bigger companies, and hacking on the earliest version of what would become repl.it. But he did want to graduate, so to prove his merit, he did what anyone would do: he hacked into the university&#8217;s network and exposed vulnerabilities to the administration. Instead of kicking him out, they offered him a deal: work with the IT team to rebuild the network&#8217;s architecture and security, stay in school.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, after six tedious and soul-crushing years, he graduated in 2010 and went to work for Yahoo!, which, you guessed it, was tedious and soul-crushing work to a creative hacker like Amjad. This time, to keep his brain occupied, he started trying to learn a bunch of different programming languages. Only problem was, Amjad didn&#8217;t own a computer, so after work, he would go to internet cafes, where each night, he had to set up his programming environment from scratch, all while he was paying for computer time. Worse, he couldn&#8217;t save his progress, so each time, he had to restart, which slowed down his progress even further.&nbsp;</p><p>He told Japanese blog <a href="https://gihyo.jp/dev/serial/01/software_designers/0042">gihyo</a>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>My goal was to not only learn, but <strong>be proficient in four programming languages in a year</strong>. You can pick up the basics of a language really fast, but to really learn it, you need to practice a lot. <strong>But the lack of a good, portable IDE that is accessible from anywhere and anything with a browser makes it too hard to start</strong>.</em></p></blockquote><p>Google Docs had recently come out, making it easy to write and collaborate in the browser (yes, there was a time in recent history when that wasn&#8217;t a thing), and Amjad wanted something similar for code. It didn&#8217;t exist, so once again, he did the most hacker thing he could: he built a solution.&nbsp;</p><p>He teamed up with classmate Max Shawabkeh and future wife/co-founder Haya Odeh to build a program that could support cloud-based programming environments from a web browser. He didn&#8217;t need a full-fledged integrated development environment (IDE), just something to play around with and learn on, like the interactive REPLs he&#8217;d learned about studying SCHEME, a LISP dialect taught to first-year MIT computer science students.&nbsp;</p><p>So they built repl.it, and open sourced the project.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a

which meant that 200,000 people around the world were suddenly using the code that Amjad had built in internet cafes in Jordan. A month later, Zach and Ryan emailed Amjad asking him to collaborate. Amjad was already planning to quit Yahoo! to build his own business on top of repl.it, but the idea of joining forces was appealing:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>In talking to Ryan, I realized we had the same vision of what we want to do, of how we want to make the programming accessible to everybody. We had similar thoughts about coding and what we call <strong>&#8220;&#8288;the new literacy&#8288;&#8221;&#8288; and how everybody should learn how to program.&nbsp;</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>The trio worked on projects for a month, and in November, Zach flew to Jordan to convince Amjad to move to New York and work with them as a founding engineer at Codecademy. They went back and forth, debating equity, and as they drove Zach back to the airport, Amjad told him that he wouldn&#8217;t make the leap at the lower equity package Zach was offering. So in the taxi, Zach upped the offer, Amjad signed, and in January 2012, he moved to New York.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcce22345-8c32-4190-9ce2-00ec0594d634_675x508.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcce22345-8c32-4190-9ce2-00ec0594d634_675x508.png" width="675" height="508" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cce22345-8c32-4190-9ce2-00ec0594d634_675x508.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:508,&quot;width&quot;:675,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcce22345-8c32-4190-9ce2-00ec0594d634_675x508.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcce22345-8c32-4190-9ce2-00ec0594d634_675x508.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcce22345-8c32-4190-9ce2-00ec0594d634_675x508.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcce22345-8c32-4190-9ce2-00ec0594d634_675x508.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Amjad (center) and the Codecademy co-founders</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>After two years building Codecademy, during which the company raised a $10 million Series B from investors including Index, Union Square Ventures, Richard Branson, and Alexis Ohanian, Amjad decided that if he was going to live halfway around the world, he wanted to live in the home of hacker culture: Silicon Valley.&nbsp;</p><p>He left Codecademy and headed west before figuring out his next stop, and quickly landed a job at Facebook. He was attracted to the company by its strong engineering culture, but was specifically drawn to internet.org, the company&#8217;s project to bring internet access to less developed countries. It was another clear step in Amjad&#8217;s <strong>personal quest to bring the power of software to more people around the world</strong>. But the way Facebook works, you get hired by the company, and then interview with teams inside of the company. And the internet.org team didn&#8217;t have room for Amjad.&nbsp;</p><p>But at the same time, a small team at Facebook was working on building a new open source framework that would make it easier for engineers to create software for mobile: <strong>React Native</strong>. Amjad joined that team as a founding engineer, and spent nearly three years building it out.&nbsp;</p><p>The beauty of React Native is that it lets developers write code in React, a best-in-class JavaScript library, that automatically works across platforms. That means that small companies might not need an iOS team and an Android team and teams for the long-tail of platforms. One mobile team shares the same codebase, and React renders the code to the native platform&#8217;s UI. One entrepreneur I spoke to this week brought up React Native unprompted, saying, &#8220;With tools like AWS, React Native, and more, we can do an enormous amount with a team of 10 people.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>All the while, while Amjad was working towards his personal mission of making coding more accessible at Codecademy and Facebook, repl.it continued to grow in the background. Still, no one had built the product that he had thought about building back in 2011 on top of it. As he <a href="https://blog.replit.com/yc">wrote in 2018</a>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>I'd been waiting for someone to start this startup for years -- a website where people can not only learn how to code but can also build, collaborate with others, and ship software.</em></p></blockquote><p>Amjad wanted that company to exist, but he wasn&#8217;t sure he wanted to be an entrepreneur. This recent thread captures all of the things he did to try to <em>not </em>start Replit as a startup.</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1467258383350730756?s=20&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;I dreaded the idea of starting a company.\n\nAs an early employee, I saw how painful startups were, in both success &amp;amp; failure.\n\nReplit was forcing itself unto the world; it was no longer sustainable as a side project.\n\nBefore incorporating, here are all the ways we tried *not* to:&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;amasad&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Amjad Masad &#10261;&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Sat Dec 04 22:23:53 +0000 2021&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:121,&quot;like_count&quot;:1268,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null}"><a href="https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1467258383350730756?s=20" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-user-avatar" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/twitter_name/w_36/amasad.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @amasad"><span class="tweet-author-name">Amjad Masad &#10261; </span><span class="tweet-author">@amasad</span></div>I dreaded the idea of starting a company.

As an early employee, I saw how painful startups were, in both success &amp; failure.

Replit was forcing itself unto the world; it was no longer sustainable as a side project.

Before incorporating, here are all the ways we tried *not* to:</a><a href="https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1467258383350730756?s=20" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-footer"><p class="tweet-date">December 4th 2021</p><span class="retweets"><span class="rt-count">121</span> Retweets</span><span class="likes"><span class="like-count">1,268</span> Likes</span></div></a></div><p>Facebook wouldn&#8217;t let him build it as an internal project. Merging with existing startups didn&#8217;t work. Y Combinator rejected Replit three times (before ultimately accepting them, which you can <a href="https://blog.replit.com/yc">read about here</a>). He attempted to bring in an outside CEO but couldn&#8217;t find one who believed in the vision as strongly as he did.&nbsp;</p><p>So Amjad did some soul searching. Specifically, he dug into Danish philosopher S&#248;ren Kierkegaard&#8217;s work on despair, heavy stuff that deals with peoples&#8217; internal tension between the finite and the infinite. (My man contains multitudes.) You should read Amjad&#8217;s thoughts in this <a href="https://amasad.me/kierkegaard">April 2016 blog post</a> for more color, but ultimately, he realized that entrepreneurship was a means of reconciling the finite (just doing) and the infinite (dreaming and imagining).&nbsp;</p><p>I&#8217;m about to drop a long block quote from that essay, which <a href="https://twitter.com/damccormick13">Dan</a> always advises me not to do, but I think it&#8217;s important because it both directly influenced Amjad&#8217;s decision to start Replit and indirectly shaped the company&#8217;s product and strategy:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>I view <strong>entrepreneurship as means of reconciling the infinite and finite</strong>. You venture into your imagination, gather knowledge, and dream about a better world. But you have to bring some of that back to earth. <strong>You take a step -- no matter how small -- towards your imagined world in the real world.</strong></em></p><p><em>This is not a one time thing, <strong>it's a recursive process</strong>. If your imagined possibilities became real then that's your new "finite". The process restarts and that's how we make progress.</em></p><p><em>I see this as the perfect framework for the work we do in <strong>technology. There is always a tension between what is and what could be.</strong>&nbsp;</em></p><p><em><strong>Taking a step into the infinite could be hard, but the hardest thing of all is bringing something back to the finite. The real art is coming up with the smallest possible task that can be done here and now.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>Amjad wrote that post on April 14th, 2016. That same month, he quit his job at Facebook, resolved his Kierkegardian tension, and founded Replit.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1454e395-7788-4a44-87f0-835e80c18d5c_782x292.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1454e395-7788-4a44-87f0-835e80c18d5c_782x292.png" width="782" height="292" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1454e395-7788-4a44-87f0-835e80c18d5c_782x292.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:292,&quot;width&quot;:782,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1454e395-7788-4a44-87f0-835e80c18d5c_782x292.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1454e395-7788-4a44-87f0-835e80c18d5c_782x292.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1454e395-7788-4a44-87f0-835e80c18d5c_782x292.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1454e395-7788-4a44-87f0-835e80c18d5c_782x292.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>(Actually, he launched &#8220;Neoreason&#8221; to build a suite of products that augment human reason, starting with programming, but quickly adopted the name Replit from the open source project when they realized how hard it would be to build just that one product really well.)</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40407eec-50ec-478d-ae82-39b2e350c1f6_888x508.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40407eec-50ec-478d-ae82-39b2e350c1f6_888x508.png" width="888" height="508" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/40407eec-50ec-478d-ae82-39b2e350c1f6_888x508.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:508,&quot;width&quot;:888,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40407eec-50ec-478d-ae82-39b2e350c1f6_888x508.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40407eec-50ec-478d-ae82-39b2e350c1f6_888x508.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40407eec-50ec-478d-ae82-39b2e350c1f6_888x508.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40407eec-50ec-478d-ae82-39b2e350c1f6_888x508.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Replit was born as Neoreason</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>The early days of Replit were a family affair.

It&#8217;s everything someone needs to code, all within the browser and with real-time collaboration built-in, that&#8217;s simple enough for beginners to pick up in minutes (I make all my beautiful designs in Figma).&nbsp;</p><p>Another way to think of it is like <strong>Roblox for software</strong>.

And they were going to have to fund it themselves, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Haya and Amjad agreed to give themselves $20k to get the company off the ground until they could find a revenue model or get the company off the ground. While they sold their code evaluation infrastructure as an API to earn some money, the free (and expensive to maintain) product was growing a lot faster.&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily, in October 2016, <a href="https://twitter.com/roybahat">Roy Bahat</a> at Bloomberg Beta took a chance on Replit, leading a $600k round at a $6 million valuation that they called a seed, but was really like a pre-seed. Around that time, they were rejected by Y Combinator for the first time.&nbsp;</p><p>Having secured a little breathing room but not enough to get comfortable, they agreed that they needed to be &#8220;default alive,&#8221; a <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/aord.html">Paul Graham concept</a> that meant earning enough revenue to keep itself going even if outside funding dried up. They decided to start selling a paid version to schools, which they called Classrooms and recently rebranded to <a href="https://replit.com/site/teams-for-education">Teams for Education</a>. As Amjad has said on podcasts, that meant operating in two markets in which it&#8217;s traditionally been tough to build big businesses: Developer Tools and Education.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the challenge, after a few months, Replit was on a $150k revenue run rate. It was a good start, but the team realized even then that it wasn&#8217;t a scalable model. Meanwhile, though, the free REPL product kept growing and growing on its own and was starting to generate buzz on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, Y Combinator&#8217;s popular message board for hackers. <strong>Y Combinator had now rejected Replit three times</strong>, but its founder, Paul Graham, stumbled upon the product on Hacker News and told YC President Sam Altman to reach out.&nbsp;</p><p>On the eve of the application deadline for the Winter 2018 batch, Altman encouraged Amjad to submit a late application, which he and Haya completed hastily that night, including a joke link to a notorious Rick Astley song in lieu of a video submission. The next morning, Amjad and Haya took an Uber to YC in Mountain View and waited outside.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f8ad711-8cf8-4154-a5cf-a114091c2ed1_458x508.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f8ad711-8cf8-4154-a5cf-a114091c2ed1_458x508.png" width="458" height="508" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9f8ad711-8cf8-4154-a5cf-a114091c2ed1_458x508.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:508,&quot;width&quot;:458,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f8ad711-8cf8-4154-a5cf-a114091c2ed1_458x508.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f8ad711-8cf8-4154-a5cf-a114091c2ed1_458x508.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f8ad711-8cf8-4154-a5cf-a114091c2ed1_458x508.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f8ad711-8cf8-4154-a5cf-a114091c2ed1_458x508.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Haya and Amjad Outside Their YC Interview in 2017</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Three hours later, they got the call: they had secured an interview, and rushed inside, where partner Michael Siebel greeted them, deadpan, with their first question: &#8220;Why did you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Rick Roll</a> us?&#8221; Somehow, even though the joke bombed, they got accepted.

Throughout the spring and early summer, VCs kept reaching out to preempt a Series B. Amjad kept telling them no. Finally, a &#8220;too big to ignore&#8221; fund came in and kicked off the process. They moved too slowly to seal the deal, but other funds swooped in.&nbsp;</p><p>Coatue&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/Mazzeo">Matt Mazzeo</a> wrote the first term sheet, then another fund came in at 2x the price, Coatue came back a little higher, and another firm came in above <em>that</em>. Amjad chose Coatue, despite the lower price, because he was excited about what Mazzeo and the firm could do to help the company grow and build out its business. When the dust settled, Replit had raised an<strong> $80 million Series B led by Coatue at an $800 million valuation</strong> and Mazzeo joined the board.</p><p>I participated in this round with Not Boring Capital, and among everything else that I&#8217;ve talked about, there were three main reasons.</p><p><strong>First</strong>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ankurnagpal">Ankur Nagpal</a>, who introduced me to Amjad, was investing, and for Ankur to invest in a round at an $800 million valuation, there needed to be something really special happening.</p><p><strong>Second</strong>, Replit&#8217;s growth was unbelievable.

And while Replit didn&#8217;t want to disclose revenue, it&#8217;s $7/mo Hacker Plan, from which the company currently derives most of its revenue, isn&#8217;t likely going to be the main source of revenue at scale. And $800 million is a big price tag.&nbsp;</p><p>To overtake strong incumbent competitors over the next decade, Replit is attacking a three-part master plan:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p>Become the default entry-to-coding environment and grow the worldwide developer population</p></li><li><p>Become the best place to create and monetize software</p></li><li><p>Build the operating system for the 21st century</p></li></ol><p>The whole strategy is centered around the <strong>third</strong> reason I&#8217;m so excited, one that deserves a section of its own: the <strong>Compounding Power of Young Users</strong>.</p><h3><strong>Compounding Power of Young Users</strong></h3><blockquote><p><em>Whatever platform the best 15 year old hackers are using today, everyone will use in 10 years.

That means partnering with schools, even though education is a hard sell. It means making it easier for kids to program what they want to program. They recently launched <a href="https://replit.com/site/kaboom">kaboom.js</a>, a simple game programming library and environment, because they knew that a lot of kids started writing code in <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/search/projects?q=game">Scratch</a>, MIT&#8217;s gaming language.&nbsp;</p><div id="youtube2-xF3--Ec_E-0" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;xF3--Ec_E-0&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xF3--Ec_E-0?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>Over time, as those kids evolve and get more talented and build more complex things, Replit&#8217;s job is to keep up, or better yet, stay a step ahead. Some of that will come from better software and primitives that the company builds itself, like the <a href="https://blog.replit.com/nix">Nix-based OS infrastructure</a> it built to support every programming language, but a lot of it will come from the things that the community builds itself. </p><p>The more extensions, add-ons, code, and services that live inside of Replit, the less of a reason young hackers have to try anything else. If young hackers build their businesses, and their customer bases inside Replit, the higher their switching costs. Plus, as they make friends and collaborators in Replit, and build their social/professional network in the community, the less likely they are to leave.&nbsp;</p><p>If Replit gets it right, they might be able to <a href="https://amasad.me/leapfrog">leapfrog the IDE</a>. In a post of the same name, Amjad wrote that the company realized that some more advanced developers weren&#8217;t just using Replit to learn and hack around; they were using it as their primary programming environment:</p><blockquote><p><em>This seems surprising at first: other than for learning, why would anyone use a more limited tool over a more mature and flexible one?</em></p><p><em>It turns out this was the wrong question to ask. A better one would be: <strong>"If someone had already learned to code on an online REPL and it serves their needs then why would they want to invest in a local setup?"</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>That&#8217;s the Compounding Power of Young Users at work. Now that Replit has wedged its way into its young users&#8217; workflows and habits, those customers are Replit&#8217;s to lose as they mature. The burden of acquisition it on Replit&#8217;s upmarket competitors.</p><p>Over the next few years, Replit will need to squeeze more power into its browser-based environment, to satisfy its users as they improve, while maintaining the simplicity that will continue to feed the top of the funnel with new users. Dixon has thoughts here, too, writing that the toys that become big things ride powerful &#8220;external forces: microchips getting cheaper, bandwidth becoming ubiquitous, mobile devices getting smarter, etc.&#8221;</p><p>To transition from <strong>Step 1</strong> &#8211; become the default entry-to-coding environment - to <strong>Step 2</strong> &#8211; become the best place to create and monetize software &#8211; Replit&#8217;s small but mighty team of generalist hackers, alongside its community, will need to take advantage of macro improvements in technology to pack more punch in the browser.&nbsp;</p><p>They&#8217;ll also need to give their users the tools to build better ways to monetize their work, and to build a new economy.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>R3plit</strong></h3><p>In September, Amjad dropped this double-entweetdre:</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1440394441269727236&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Imagine a global compute network with millions of users building on shared programmable primitives.

Replit wants to reduce the time it takes someone to go from writing their first line of code to making their first dollar on the platform, and with such a large base of international and under-18 users, Replit currency might be the easiest way to make that happen. In the beginning, that might look more like Robux than $REPL, but over time, the company is excited about the idea of introducing <strong>programmable money</strong>.</p><p>&#8220;Building a unit of account into the system will unlock a lot of interesting things,&#8221; Amjad told me:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>If we give people money as a <strong>platform primitive</strong>, people will do surprising things. The way I see us is as a <strong>toymaker</strong>: when you make a toy, you don&#8217;t know how kids are going to play with it, you just need to watch and see what they come up with.</em></p></blockquote><p>Maybe the next big things will start out looking like a toymaker. If it&#8217;s successful in its ambitious vision, Replit will help bring about a fully-formed web3, one that&#8217;s <strong>read-write-own-remix</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Like web3 itself, Replit will be a vortex for talent, creativity, and economic activity online. It might become the operating system for the 21st Century, the platform on top of which much of the internet is built, remixed and monetized.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Building the Operating System for the 21st Century</strong></h3><p>I&#8217;ve been fully glowing in my analysis up until now. As you can tell, I&#8217;ve been Replit-pilled. That doesn&#8217;t mean that success is guaranteed by any stretch of the imagination; it just means that the risks are obvious enough as to not be particularly interesting.&nbsp;</p><p>First and foremost, <strong>Replit is surrounded by competitors on all sides</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>On the low-end, there are online sandboxes like CodePen and CodeSandbox, which let more advanced developers set up environments to prototype and test JavaScript code. Game creation languages and environments like Scratch, Roblox, and Minecraft let kids build out of the box, with practically no learning or adult assistance necessary. Every time someone writes their first line of code, or makes their first dollar online, somewhere else, it&#8217;s a threat to Replit&#8217;s carefully-laid long-term plan.&nbsp;</p><p>On the high-end, Microsoft and Amazon loom large. Microsoft is the 800 lb gorilla in programming, with GitHub, Visual Studio, and Azure, and Amazon is both the largest cloud provider with AWS and owns one of the most popular cloud-based IDEs in Cloud9. It&#8217;s easy to say that Replit can retain users as they grow, but as it stands today, many will need to move into more powerful environments if they go work for a big company or want to build scale products.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#8217;s hard not to appreciate the coding and gaming war chest that Microsoft has built up through acquisition. Until writing this piece, I didn&#8217;t realize that Microsoft had the most popular IDE (Visual Studio) and code repository (GitHub), plus Minecraft and XBox and a host of other products, all on the side of its desk. Plus, it&#8217;s transitioned Office to the cloud well under Satya Nadella after a slow start. It won&#8217;t go down easily. I would be surprised if Microsoft doesn&#8217;t offer Replit a whole lot of money to stave off the threat one day, and I would be more surprised if Replit sells; it may or may not have turned down some pretty big offers in the past.&nbsp;</p><p>And then there&#8217;s the no-code movement. Maybe being able to string together no-code tools will replace the need to code for most people (although that starts to look like coding itself).&nbsp;</p><p>But competition is a known quantity, and one that Amjad told me he&#8217;s not particularly worried about. <strong>As long as Replit keeps growing and retaining young coders like they have been, the future is theirs.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Second, there&#8217;s <strong>business model risk</strong>. Today, Replit makes the majority of its money via subscriptions, but that&#8217;s not how it plans to monetize in the future. It has the outlines of its future business model sketched out, but its ability to make the switch is yet to be proven.&nbsp;</p><p>The third big risk is that <strong>transitioning from a Replit-controlled coding environment to a full fledged platform and economy is a really hard transition</strong>. If the underlying technology doesn&#8217;t get good enough to match local solutions in the browser, or if those local solutions improve at a faster rate than Replit can, then the dream of growing with young users could be dead on arrival.&nbsp;</p><p>Then there&#8217;s the fact that, depending on whose definition you use, Replit isn&#8217;t even a platform yet, let alone the operating system for the 21st Century.&nbsp;</p><p>The canonical definition of a platform is the one that Ben Thompson coined the <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-bill-gates-line/">Bill Gates Line</a> based on a <a href="https://semilshah.com/2015/09/17/transcript-chamath-at-strictlyvcs-insider-series/">Chamath quote</a> about Gates&#8217; thoughts on Facebook as a platform:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>That&#8217;s a crock of shit. This isn&#8217;t a platform. <strong>A platform is when the economic value of everybody that uses it, exceeds the value of the company that creates it.</strong> Then it&#8217;s a platform.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>Amjad has a slightly different definition: <strong>a platform is when most of the functionality is built by developers not employed by the company.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Today, Replit may be a platform based on the Bill Gates definition because most of its users use Replit for free, and many are making thousands of dollars or more from what they build, but by Amjad&#8217;s definition, it&#8217;s not yet a platform. Most of the functionality is still built by Replit&#8217;s small but mighty team of hackers.&nbsp;</p><p>But that definition, along with everything else we&#8217;ve covered up to now, hint at what Replit is building towards.&nbsp;</p><p>Replit envisions a world in which <strong>a billion people learn to code and build products on Replit</strong>. Many of those products will be built for the broader internet, but many will also be built to make Replit itself more powerful. </p><p>It&#8217;s a <strong>double-compounding power of young hackers: </strong>as they develop, they&#8217;ll get good enough to improve the platform itself.</p><p>By rebuilding its infrastructure on Nix, Replit just tapped into an infinite network of open source code. Next, Replit might let an infinite network of builders tap into it by opening its APIs, open sourcing a big part of the platform, and letting people plug in and build their own extensions. Replit is really a primitives company, and composability will be a key piece of its strategy. That could take a variety of forms:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Users will build tools and services for other users, and using programmable money as a primitive, will get paid whenever their services are used.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>It could build its own hosting infrastructure, or tap into a global network of smaller cloud hosting providers to compete with AWS in a more decentralized way.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Replit could let users charge to let other users fork their code, with royalties streaming back to the original creator every time the remixed code is used commercially.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Replit might host a software, API, and infrastructure marketplace where its users can find the legos they need to build their things.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>More likely, just as Replit automatically pulls in the right packages today, it could automatically pull in the right piece of software at the right time for its users, and make payments happen automatically. Users might even be able to add mini-paywalls with annotations in the code base.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>In this world, Replit would make it as easy as possible for anyone to spin up new, bespoke products and find demand if their work is good enough. The more live code that exists on Replit or that lives on a blockchain accessed via Replit, and the less dead code sitting in GitHub repositories, the more people will be able to remix the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>Replit is a special company in isolation, but it <strong>gets really interesting when you combine it with web3</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the <strong>big innovations of web3 is that there&#8217;s a shared backend and database on top of which anyone who knows how to code can build unique user experiences</strong>. In the ideal state, it could actually cause a reallocation of engineering resources globally to focus more on creating differentiated front-ends and less on re-building the same backend infrastructure and databases over and over again.&nbsp;</p><p>Combining that shift with a billion new software creators will have unimaginably dramatic effects on what type of software products people create. That&#8217;s the fun part about building legos: it&#8217;s impossible to predict exactly <em>what</em> will emerge, but easy to predict that we&#8217;re going to see a mind blowing amount of innovation. Each project is a jumping off point for the next.</p><p>The internet will only be as decentralized as people&#8217;s ability to code, or at least understand code, is democratized. Replit is building a world in which billions of people can build.&nbsp;</p><p>Let&#8217;s remix the internet.

A really expensive art museum with a terrible collection might be a 3 on fun and -1 on money. An online course that you&#8217;re taking purely to learn about something that fascinates you might be a 9 on fun and a 0 on money. A fast-growing startup with an electric culture solving a problem you want to solve might be an 8 on fun and a 9 on money.&nbsp;</p><p>Each example is also subject to each person&#8217;s preferences and situation. Reading sci-fi might be higher on the fun and money scale for me because on the fun side, I&#8217;m a nerd, and on the money side, maybe it sparks an idea that helps me write something great. Some people genuinely enjoy working in investment banking. And each person has his or her own opportunity set &#8211; that energetic, important, fast-growing startup might only hire people who are in the top 0.1% of people in their respective professions.&nbsp;</p><p>Every decision overlaps, intersects, and influences the others. Maybe you choose to work in investment banking, sacrificing fun for money at work, because you really want to live in a nice place today or because you want to retire early and do only fun things thereafter.&nbsp;</p><p>And finally, that stone in the shoe of economists: humans aren&#8217;t as rational as the textbooks would suggest. People often choose to do things that aren&#8217;t particularly fun or financially fruitful. Humans gonna human.&nbsp;</p><p>But assuming that we&#8217;ve baked everything in correctly, and accounted for and discounted the future implications of our current decisions, for the sake of this thought exercise, we can say that <strong>humans make decisions in such a way that maximizes fun and money</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>You wouldn&#8217;t choose a job that&#8217;s a 2 on fun and a 3 on money when a job that&#8217;s a 3 on fun and a 5 on money is available to you. You could, however, choose among options that add up to the same total from different angles. Jobs that are 2 on fun and 6 on money, 3 on fun and 5 on money, and 4 on both fun and money might be equally attractive. These equal choices are <strong>Pareto efficient.</strong></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd890bc0-a955-44ea-8af6-9ed41323df3d_1265x939.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd890bc0-a955-44ea-8af6-9ed41323df3d_1265x939.png" width="1265" height="939" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/dd890bc0-a955-44ea-8af6-9ed41323df3d_1265x939.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:939,&quot;width&quot;:1265,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd890bc0-a955-44ea-8af6-9ed41323df3d_1265x939.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd890bc0-a955-44ea-8af6-9ed41323df3d_1265x939.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd890bc0-a955-44ea-8af6-9ed41323df3d_1265x939.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd890bc0-a955-44ea-8af6-9ed41323df3d_1265x939.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">Pareto efficiency</a></strong> is &#8220;a situation where no individual or preference criterion can be better off without making at least one individual or preference criterion worse off or without any loss thereof.&#8221; In our example, you couldn&#8217;t get a job that&#8217;s 1 point more fun without giving up 1 point of money.

Early adopters might be drawn to particular web3 projects because they&#8217;re a more fun way to make money than their job, or because they get to earn money by doing things that they find fun anyway. As web3 grows, more use cases emerge that are appealing to more people on one or both dimensions.&nbsp;</p><p>The most straightforward example here is the <strong>play-to-earn</strong> gaming movement kicked off by <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/infinity-revenue-infinity-possibilities">Axie Infinity</a>. Axie is neither the most fun game in the world nor the highest-paying job in the world, but it was able to attract over a million players because it offered more money than the games they were used to playing, and more fun (and often money) than the other jobs available to them. If players&#8217; old games were 7 on fun and 1 on money, and their old jobs were 2 on fun and 4 on money, Axie&#8217;s 5 on fun and 6 on money pushed the funtier out.&nbsp;</p><p>Web3 gaming isn&#8217;t finished here. The space will evolve along those two dimensions: fun and money. New games, and improvements from Axie itself, will focus on both tokenomic designs that make players more money and game designs that make the games more fun to play.&nbsp;</p><p>In <em><a href="https://www.mechanism.capital/crypto-gaming-thesis/">The Financialization of Fun</a></em>, Mechanism Capital&#8217;s Eva Wu wrote that she sees two major categories emerging:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>1) <strong>&#8220;Play-first&#8221; crypto games</strong> where the fun gameplay takes centre stage and crypto is used as a competitive edge to engage players further.</em></p><p><em>2) <strong>&#8220;Earn-first&#8221; crypto games </strong>where the main allure, gameplay and fun ultimately come from earning money by participating in crypto game economies.</em></p></blockquote><p>But if you&#8217;ve been reading Not Boring, you know that many of us are playing the <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game">Great Online Game</a>, an infinite game playing out across the internet with crypto as the in-game currency.

In an excellent piece, <em><a href="https://www.drorpoleg.com/in-praise-of-ponzis/">In Praise of Ponzis</a>,</em> my friend Dror Poleg addressed a recent event that, on its face, made absolutely no sense: the $PEOPLE tokens&#8217; explosion in value after ConstitutionDAO&#8217;s loss at auction:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>The price of $PEOPLE tokens shot up dramatically. It was worth nearly 100 times more than what original contributors paid at its peak&#8230; Why would anyone pay to buy a token that no longer has a purpose?</em></p><p><em>There are many explanations why $PEOPLE still has a liquid market, but they all boil down to this: <strong>It's a good story. People love a good story. And people believe that the value of this story will only increase over time.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve reached a tipping point where <strong>the most fun outcome is often the most likely, and even the most financially rewarding</strong>. That&#8217;s new. Having fun and making money aren&#8217;t supposed to go together. There&#8217;s a two-part reason for the shift:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p>All else equal, <strong>people would love if the most fun thing they could do would also make them the most money</strong>. It&#8217;s like wishing for delicious pizza that&#8217;s as healthy as broccoli.</p></li><li><p>We&#8217;ve hit a point where <strong>enough people believe that </strong><em><strong>other</strong></em><strong> people believe that the most fun outcome and the best meme will have the most value</strong>, which reflexively makes it come to pass. It&#8217;s like Bitcoin having value because enough people believe Bitcoin is valuable, but way more fun.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>You could look at investing in memes as a dumb ponzi that&#8217;s bound to lead to disaster, or as a pure distillation of the intersection of money and fun. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle.&nbsp;</p><p>Less controversially, the recent explosion in DAOs has already shown glimpses of a future in which peoples&#8217; passions and financial interests merge.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>The OG, <a href="https://www.fwb.help/">Friends with Benefits</a> (FWB), is a mix of social club and studio that crosses between online and IRL. Its relatively early adopters have been rewarded by a 10x+ appreciation in the price of $FWB token since the summer.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><a href="https://seedclub.xyz/">Seed Club</a> is like Y Combinator in DAO form, a community helping develop the next wave of successful communities and sharing in the upside.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Six-month-old <a href="https://krausehouse.club/">KrauseHouse</a> recently raised 1,000 ETH (over $4 million) from 1,692 backers through a <a href="https://krausehouse.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0x9F6F91078A5072A8B54695DAfA2374Ab3cCd603b">Mirror crowdfund</a> to kickstart the DAO&#8217;s effort to buy an NBA team.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAccessDAO">OpenAccessDAO</a> launched last month to buy paywalled research papers and make them publicly available in an effort to liberate valuable knowledge.</p></li><li><p>A to-be-announced DAO is picking up where ConstitutionDAO left off and building a distributed museum curated and owned by its members.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>These are just five of many examples that are popping up, and each seems to be spawning more, whether directly through <a href="https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/7bfK9st2mvhxlla4XKotRjetq5-YhaiwqRwS8DhkD-o">SubDAOs</a> or through inspiration via <em><a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/idea-legos">Idea Legos</a></em>.</p><p>If you looked at DAOs today as just less efficient, more chaotic versions of LLCs, you&#8217;d once again be missing the point. They&#8217;re powering more fun ways to make money, and giving people upside for having fun, curating and creating culture, and funding public goods. That combination is hoovering up a certain type of person who&#8217;s attracted to novelty, speed, and experimentation, and those people are rapidly iterating their way to projects that will attract a wider and wider audience with new use cases.&nbsp;</p><p>As more new use cases emerge, the list of trade-offs from earlier in this piece start to look like a list of false dichotomies. What if:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Learning finance could be a 5 on fun and a 7 on money (<a href="https://rabbithole.gg/">Rabbithole</a>)?</p></li><li><p>Applying that knowledge to a project could be an 8 on fun and an 7 on money (<a href="https://www.station.express/">Station</a>)?</p><p>Going to a rave could be a 10 on fun and a 5 on money (FWB)?</p></li><li><p>Going to an art museum could be an 8 on fun and a 7 on money (Museum TBA)?</p></li><li><p>Playing a video game could be a 9 on fun and a 5 on money (Play-to-Earn)?</p></li><li><p>Watching basketball could be a 7 on fun and a 6 on money (KrauseHouse)?</p></li><li><p>Investing in a restaurant could be an 8 on fun and a 5 on money (TBA)?&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Being that friend who finds all the good music early could be an 8 on fun and a 5 on money (<a href="https://www.sound.xyz/">sound.xyz</a>)?&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>When people talk about web3 merging culture and finance, or &#8220;financializing culture,&#8221; these are some of the many examples they&#8217;re talking about. Financializing sounds like a dirty word, but put another way, it&#8217;s <strong>giving people a chance to earn money while they do what they find fun</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>That doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that everyone is going to quit their jobs to join DAOs and trade NFTs, or that everything that people currently do for fun will be replaced by a money-making equivalent.&nbsp;</p><p>Many people will want the financial stability of a traditional job or the challenge that comes with solving deeply hard problems. There are tons of people in climate, medicine, space, and more to whom, thankfully, the most fun and financially rewarding thing, the Pareto ef<strong>fun</strong>ciont choice (I&#8217;m sorry), is solving those very hard problems. We all need to hope they keep doing those things, and to make it as financially rewarding as possible to do so by supporting the efforts through mechanisms like <a href="https://klimadao.finance/">KlimaDAO</a> and the offshoots it will inspire.</p><p>Similarly, most people will continue to pursue hobbies or entertainment just because they&#8217;re fun for a long time, with no expectation of monetary reward. Most web3 consumer experiences can&#8217;t match their pre-existing counterparts on product funness alone yet, and there won&#8217;t be universal adoption until they do.&nbsp;</p><p>Until now, web3 has attracted people who have been willing to deal with often janky experiences for the chance at enormous financial upside, as well as builders and internet explorers who find it genuinely fun to play at the cutting edge, to jump into noisy Discords and Telegrams and just try to keep up, whether or not it makes them any money. Web3 wouldn&#8217;t have broken out the way it has over the past year if people weren&#8217;t building through the crypto winter because they loved it. Those people on both sides &#8211; the speculators and true believers &#8211; are necessary to bring about a new Pareto funtier before it smooths itself out.&nbsp;</p><p>Obviously, there is a much bigger swath of the population for whom spending hours and hours in noisy Discords is the <em>least</em> fun thing they could imagine doing. For web3 to pull those people in, it will likely need to meet them in the places they&#8217;re already having fun or making money.&nbsp;</p><p>We talk a lot about the <a href="https://variant.fund/writing/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software">Ownership Economy</a> and the <a href="https://future.a16z.com/passion-economy/">Passion Economy</a>, as we should, but for our purposes, it&#8217;s instructive to dive into the <strong>Experience Economy</strong>.</p><p>In late 2017, a couple years before in-person experiences became hard to come by, McKninsey published a report, <em><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/private-equity-and-principal-investors/our-insights/cashing-in-on-the-us-experience-economy">Cashing in on the US experience economy</a></em>, that showed that Americans, particularly younger ones, were shifting their spend from things to experiences:&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d449cb6-c0a6-48b1-b082-2280382dd217_502x434.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d449cb6-c0a6-48b1-b082-2280382dd217_502x434.png" width="502" height="434" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9d449cb6-c0a6-48b1-b082-2280382dd217_502x434.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:434,&quot;width&quot;:502,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d449cb6-c0a6-48b1-b082-2280382dd217_502x434.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d449cb6-c0a6-48b1-b082-2280382dd217_502x434.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d449cb6-c0a6-48b1-b082-2280382dd217_502x434.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d449cb6-c0a6-48b1-b082-2280382dd217_502x434.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>McKinsey</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>While spending on goods only grew 1.6% per year from 2014-2016, <strong>spending on experience-related services grew 6.3%. </strong>People were spending more of their money on <strong>fun</strong> &#8211; membership clubs, sports, parks, theater, events, museums, gambling, restaurants, and travel &#8211; and then, all of a sudden, they couldn&#8217;t.&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of the early rise of web3 can be seen as the continuation of the trend towards experiences, thrown online in a hurry, but <strong>instead of straight </strong><em><strong>spending </strong></em><strong>on experiences and trading money for fun, they&#8217;re </strong><em><strong>investing </strong></em><strong>in experiences, increasing money and fun and pushing the Pareto Funtier out.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>From here, if web3 is going to get as big as I think it can, it will push out in a few different directions.</p><p>First, it will need to integrate more seamlessly into the experiences that people already like doing, both online and IRL.</p><ul><li><p>What if by going to your favorite restaurant enough times, you got to own a table at that restaurant, automatically? What if your club membership was an NFT that you could sell to the next person when you decide to leave instead of giving up your expensive initiation fees?</p></li><li><p>What if sports leagues made it easier for fans to not just own NFTs of highlights, a la Top Shot, but parts of the teams themselves, just for showing up? Attendance is down as the at-home experience keeps getting better, this might be a way to entice people back.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>What if some of our most important and culturally-relevant non-profits, which have to spend so much time, energy, and ironically, money fundraising, were owned and governed by DAOs? A treasury backed by real-world assets with a token fueled by narrative upside would be an interesting proposition.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>What if you could gamble on crypto instead of going to a casi&#8230; wait, check.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>The intersection of the Ownership and Experience Economies will continue to push the Pareto Funtier out. It won&#8217;t replace jobs for everyone, but a knock-on effect might be that people will be able to take jobs that give up a little money for more fun since they&#8217;ll be able to earn upside from their hobbies.&nbsp;</p><p>If this seems far-fetched, fantastical, or even dystopian, consider this: a recent <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3RWxT6wHGNNofOkvLJcmWB?si=F6o2tTMCQH-8okmsyKlpeg">The Daily</a> </em>episode highlighted that <strong>Amazon hires and churns through hundreds of thousands of warehouse workers </strong><em><strong>each year</strong></em>. If you don&#8217;t think it plans to automate those roles ASAP, you don&#8217;t know Jeff. People will need new ways to earn money and find meaning, and what better way than by doing the things that they enjoy most. Human creativity and culture will be the last thing the robots can replicate; the more people making money from creativity and culture, the more resilient we are.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, the people who <em>do</em> like spending their time online, particularly younger people, will learn the skills to create and manage their own, ever-more-niche communities, experiences, and online worlds. More people will be empowered to create experiences that are more fun for certain groups of people and share in the financial upside from doing so.&nbsp;</p><p>If web 1.0 was read-only, and web 2.0 was read-write, then to reach its full potential, <strong>web3 will need to become read-write-remix</strong>. More people armed with web3 legos and coding literacy will create experiences we can&#8217;t yet imagine for the surprisingly large niches of people who will value them most. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see <strong>web3 make the internet more bespoke</strong>. (More on this Thursday &#128064;).</p><p>In either case, it&#8217;s unlikely that the absurd returns early adopters have generated will persist. That&#8217;s ok. Speculative returns are great at attracting talent and rewarding the earliest adopters with money while the fun catches up. That talent will create more fun experiences, and more people will have access to opportunities to earn money, if not 10,000x returns, doing what they find fun. The Pareto funtier will push out.&nbsp;</p><p>To be fair, so far, we&#8217;ve seeded the embryos of some proto-DAOs, sold a bunch of digital art, and pulled a tiny fraction of the world&#8217;s financial resources into web3. So I get it if drawing a line from that to this big, fun vision sounds overly utopian or optimistic. But imagine explaining even the past decade to our Stone Age ancestors, or an 18th century American, or even someone alive when I was born in 1987. The long arc of history is bent towards more money and more fun. It&#8217;s inevitable.</p><p>The challenge will be making sure that as many people have the chance to participate as possible, and that we put even more of our resources towards the really hard problems.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a great time to be alive, and if you&#8217;re reading this, you&#8217;re one of the early ones.&nbsp;</p><p>If you find it fun to get involved in things before they&#8217;re fully formed and to help build the future, as always, my advice is to get involved. You can find a list of DAOs <a href="https://daolist.fyi/">at DAOlist here</a>. If you see something that looks fun, jump in. It will be an experience, and maybe you&#8217;ll even make some money.&nbsp;</p><p>If you don&#8217;t see anything that aligns with your interests, it&#8217;s never been easier to pull together some friends and spin something up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you&#8217;re building already, think about how your product can push out the Pareto Funtier for your users or members.&nbsp;</p><p>If nothing else, take a second to think about whether you could be making more money having fun, or having more fun making money. You might be playing at a Pareto ineffuncient point today. What would it take to jump out to your funtier?</p><p>This is going to be fun.</p><div><hr></div><p>How did you like this week&#8217;s Not Boring?

The product <em>is</em> composability.&nbsp;</p><p>And on Thursday, I <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/stytch-kill-the-password">quoted</a> Stytch&#8217;s Reed McGinley-Stempel on the power of APIs:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Serendipity is one of the most powerful building blocks for developer platforms</strong>. You&#8217;re exposing helpful <strong>primitives</strong> to developers so that they can build better products.</em></p></blockquote><p>This isn&#8217;t a new phenomenon. Composability is the engine that drives open source software.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether web3 protocols, APIs, or open source software, composability means building in such a way that the next builder can pick up where you left off, add their own twist, and leave the combined work for the next builder.&nbsp;</p><p>That has implications beyond software. In August&#8217;s <em><a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/compounding-crazy">Compounding Crazy</a>, </em>I wrote that composability is the reason that human progress accelerates:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>That&#8217;s what powers the increasing pace of innovation. <strong>Discoveries become inventions become building blocks become inventions become building blocks, ad infinitum.&nbsp;</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>That idea was a riff on an idea from Tim Urban&#8217;s 2017 <em>Wait But Why</em> <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html">essay on Neuralink</a>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>The forces of macroeconomics make the <strong>Human Colossus&#8217;s core motivation to create value</strong>, which means it tends to want to <strong>invent newer and better technology</strong>.

Ideas got bigger and better faster and faster. Ideas composed and compounded more quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>If compound interest is easy to quantify but difficult to feel in your bones, and software composability is harder to quantify and even harder to intuit, <strong>idea composability is the hardest to measure and feel of all</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>When an engineer plugs in an API or web3 protocol, they&#8217;re making a conscious choice. When someone picks up and riffs on an idea, though, they might not even know that they&#8217;re doing it. If you want to pull this thread, you should read Questlove&#8217;s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Quest-Questlove/dp/0062670557">Creative Quest</a>.</em> My main takeaway is that <strong>creativity is remixing</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Idea composability is underappreciated because it&#8217;s hard to measure and trace. But idea composability is one of the main contributors to all of the progress and speed we&#8217;re experiencing. <strong>Ideas are building on each other more quickly than ever before, too</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>We&#8217;ve only had access to the world&#8217;s knowledge at our fingertips for like twenty years. That&#8217;s practical knowledge -- like mathematical equations or SAFEs or lectures -- but it&#8217;s also inspirational knowledge -- whenever a person or group of people does something, the rest of humanity knows that thing is possible within minutes. It wouldn&#8217;t make any sense for that access to knowledge and inspiration <em>not</em> to result in progressively more spectacular results.&nbsp;</p><p>On the inspirational side, the famous example is the four-minute mile. The mile world record dropped from 4:06.2 to 4:01.4 between 1942 and 1945, and then it <strong>stood unbroken for nine years</strong>. After Sir Roger Bannister broke the four-minute mile, the next person did it 46 days later. A year after that, three runners broke the four-minute mile in the <em>same race</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Bannister proved that humans could run a mile in under four minutes; other runners took that knowledge off the shelf and used to break it four minutes themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>I remember reading a book a few years ago, I think it was <em>The Rise of Superman</em>, in which the author described a similar phenomenon in extreme sports like skateboarding. A particular trick would be impossible until it wasn&#8217;t, and then the next batch of skaters would build on top of that trick. That guy did a 720? Cool, the next guy will try to rip a 900.&nbsp;</p><p>Importantly, unlike software, skateboarders can&#8217;t just plug in the other person&#8217;s 720 and snap another 180 on top. Skateboarding tricks aren&#8217;t <em>technically</em> composable. Each skater has to do the full thing themselves. But the proof that something is possible unlocks something that helps the next person go bigger.

That kind of rapid compounding produces very big results very quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>Let&#8217;s get meta. <strong>DeFi 2.0 itself is a prime example of this phenomenon</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Decentralized Finance (&#8220;DeFi&#8221;) exploded in popularity in 2020 during &#8220;DeFi Summer.&#8221; Total Value Locked grew from ~$1 billion on Memorial Day to ~$8 billion by Labor Day. DeFi 1.0 created a new opportunities for on-chain lending and borrowing, but also faced challenges, namely protocols&#8217; ability to retain liquidity. In the beginning, they offer eye-poppingly high yields to convince people to stake and create liquidity, but once yields drop, the money goes away. It&#8217;s not loyal.&nbsp;</p><p>So <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Quest-Questlove/dp/0062670557">OlympusDAO</a> launched in March this year, less than a year after DeFi Summer, with proposed solutions to common issues with DeFi, kicking off DeFi 2.0. The TL;DR is that <strong>DeFi 2.0 protocols own their liquidity instead of renting it</strong>. Olympus isn&#8217;t composed of DeFi 1.0 software as much as it&#8217;s composed of DeFi 1.0 <em>ideas</em>, game theory, and market understanding of DeFi. Offering 7,000% APY seems less scammy once people are used to very high DeFi yields.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23ec38b8-d706-4be8-a6fb-9088b0b9f26a_1018x508.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23ec38b8-d706-4be8-a6fb-9088b0b9f26a_1018x508.png" width="1018" height="508" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/23ec38b8-d706-4be8-a6fb-9088b0b9f26a_1018x508.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:508,&quot;width&quot;:1018,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23ec38b8-d706-4be8-a6fb-9088b0b9f26a_1018x508.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23ec38b8-d706-4be8-a6fb-9088b0b9f26a_1018x508.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23ec38b8-d706-4be8-a6fb-9088b0b9f26a_1018x508.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23ec38b8-d706-4be8-a6fb-9088b0b9f26a_1018x508.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Olympus</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Since March, Olympus itself has become a building block, spawning a new generation of offshoots like <a href="https://www.klimadao.finance/">Klima</a> that compose Olympus&#8217; DeFi lego, using Olympus Pro, but also its idea lego, namely: what happens when you create a black hole for certain types of assets using bonding and staking.

In the past few days on Twitter, I&#8217;ve seen proposals of varying seriousness to launch DAOs to buy NFL teams, soccer (football?) clubs, the Empire State Building, fossil fuel companies, to buy and decentralize businesses, and to raise money for worthy causes. These ideas will get bigger and more impactful. The design space has opened up.&nbsp;</p><p>The <strong>next DAOs to launch will have a built-in advantage</strong>. The fact that DAOs operate more openly and publicly than a traditional company means that its lessons, positive and negative, are more easily composable. Even the (necessary, given time constraints) shortcomings -- like telegraphing our max bid in a public wallet, not being able to fractionalize ownership for regulatory reasons, and dealing with high gas fees -- gave builders new things to work on and provided the next DAO a clearer roadmap. ConstitutionDAO itself is using the learnings to adjust as it heads into its <a href="https://discord.gg/wYJGECXa">second chapter</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Although DAOs have been around for over half a decade, publicly pushing the boundaries of what a DAO can do in just a few days and spreading the message on the wings of memes has incepted millions of people with new idea legos, which they&#8217;ll be able to compose with other idea and software legos to run the <em>next</em> experiment.&nbsp;</p><p>ConstitutionDAO happened in a week. These ideas will spin up and compound quickly. In aggregate, the progress we make will get very big, very fast. By this time next year, chances are, the bid to buy the Constitution will be a quaint but important memory, one big lego near the base of a much larger composition.&nbsp;</p><p>The fun part is that anyone can add ideas to the composition. You don&#8217;t need to know how to code.

Often, it takes a couple of days. <strong><a href="https://stytch.com/">Stytch</a></strong> <strong>filled in 64 minutes</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>That was February 17th of this year. We invested in the Series A at a $230 million valuation, which honestly seemed high given that the company was six months old, but Stytch had all of the early markers:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Co-founders.</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/McStempel">Reed McGinley-Stempel</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/juliannaelamb">Julianna Lamb</a> are the perfect people to build this, having worked together on bank account authentication at <a href="https://plaid.com/">Plaid</a>. Julianna went to <a href="https://www.verygoodsecurity.com/">Very Good Security</a> as a PM after Plaid and worked on authentication there as well.</p></li><li><p><strong>Team. </strong>A software business is only as good as the people it hires, and in its first six months, it brought in engineers and designers from Plaid, Coinbase, Workday, Udemy, Intuit, Zillow, Quizlet, Carta, and Stitch Fix.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Investors. </strong>Stytch is backed by the best. At the time of our investment, Stytch was backed by Thrive, Benchmark, and Index, plus Elad Gil, Lenny Rachitsky, and the founders of Plaid, Very Good Security, and Figma. That&#8217;s a gold-plated cap table.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>API-First. </strong>Reed and Julianna set out to build the Stripe for Authentication with an API-first approach that&#8217;s more flexible and composable than the incumbents.</p></li></ul><p>Speaking of incumbents, two weeks after our investment, Okta set a strong comp by purchasing 8-year-old authentication provider <a href="https://www.okta.com/press-room/press-releases/okta-signs-agreement-to-acquire-auth0/">Auth0 for $6.5 billion</a> on March 3rd, a 3.4x increase from its last private round at $1.9 billion in July 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>Stytch has a better, more flexible product. It&#8217;s building &#8220;user infrastructure for modern applications&#8221; in the form of APIs and SDKs that developers can plug in to create customized authentication experiences, like login and checkout.&nbsp;</p><p>And Stytch is on a trajectory towards besting Auth0&#8217;s benchmark. Today, Stytch is proving the wisdom of the crowds by becoming a unicorn itself: <strong>Coatue is leading a $90 million Series B at a $1 billion valuation</strong>, with participation from existing investors Thrive, Benchmark, and Index.</p><p>But as founders are trained to say, raising money is a means, not an end. The funding just means Stytch will be around longer, can move (even) faster, and can build more products. To that end, Stytch is also announcing the launch of its <strong>first biometrics product, WebAuthn</strong>, and its <strong>first acquisition</strong>, of YC-backed competitor <strong><a href="https://www.cotter.app/">Cotter</a></strong>, a no-code passwordless login product.&nbsp;</p><p>All of this is in service of one goal: <strong>kill the password</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Now normally, when I write these deep dives, I don&#8217;t like to speak ill of competitors. Real people work for competitors, and every company has strengths and weaknesses. But passwords? No one works for passwords. Passwords cause pain and agony, or even worse, a persistent, nagging, low-grade annoyance. Fuck passwords.&nbsp;</p><p>Stytch is an armory in the war against passwords from which its customers can select the weapons they need to eliminate passwords. In peacetime, it serves as a creative foundry on top of which customers can create new, seamless authentication experiences. In either case, Stytch makes digital products more secure while increasing conversion and revenue. It built API-first because it knows that its customers know more about <em>their</em> customers than Stytch can, and because it knows that the collective creativity will lead to emergent behaviors it couldn&#8217;t predict itself.&nbsp;</p><p>All of it feeds into Stytch&#8217;s larger mission: <strong>to eliminate friction from the internet</strong>.</p><p>That&#8217;s bigger than authentication. Stytch&#8217;s opportunity spans login to checkout, web2 to web3, inbox to face, and may be much larger than the $6.5 billion that Auth0 sold for.</p><p>To understand Stytch&#8217;s opportunity, we&#8217;ll cover:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Why Passwords Suck</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The Founders&#8217; Journey to Stytch&nbsp;</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Meet Stytch: A Friction-Reduction Company&nbsp;</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The Race to Replace the Password</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>API-First as a Competitive Advantage&nbsp;</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Why Stytch Wins</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The Big Vision&nbsp;</strong></p></li></ul><p>First, let&#8217;s take down passwords.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Why Passwords Suck</strong></h3><p>When I spoke to <a href="https://twitter.com/GauravAhujaK">Gaurav Ahuja</a>, the Thrive partner who led Stytch&#8217;s Series A and introduced me to the company, I asked him to lay out his investment thesis. He told me there were five points to his thesis, starting with the enemy:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>First, the future should be passwordless. Actually, back up, first: <strong>passwords suck</strong>. And they suck in three ways:</em></p></blockquote><ol><li><p><em>They&#8217;re a terrible user experience.&nbsp;</em></p></li><li><p><em>They hurt user engagement, conversion, and revenue.&nbsp;</em></p></li><li><p><em>They&#8217;re a burden on IT support.</em></p></li></ol><p>Gaurav&#8217;s a really nice guy. That&#8217;s the meanest thing I&#8217;ve ever heard him say. But passwords deserve it.&nbsp;</p><p>If humanity were designing authentication from scratch today with no preconceived notions, we would never come up with a system in which everyone has to memorize dozens of word/number/character combos and type them in to do anything online. We use passwords today because we&#8217;ve always used passwords. They&#8217;ve been around for millennia. Chances are, when you were a kid, and you wanted to get into your friend&#8217;s pillow fort, they asked you for the secret password.&nbsp;</p><p>But passwords are a relic. In a <a href="https://stytch.com/blog/building-the-future-of-authentication/">July blog post</a>, Stytch walked through the history of the online password to explain why they no longer make sense. Each decade introduced its own authentication paradigm:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><em><strong>In the 1990s, </strong>as the internet went mainstream, passwords were the dominant form of authentication.</em></p></li></ul><ul><li><p><em><strong>In the 2000s, </strong>as users opened more and more accounts, password managers&#8212;which encrypt and store online login information&#8212;were introduced to help them handle this increasingly complex landscape.&nbsp;</em></p></li></ul><ul><li><p><em><strong>In the 2010s, </strong>as online technologies advanced, alternative auth methods&#8212;often referred to as &#8220;<strong>two-factor authentication</strong>&#8221;&#8212;embedded low-friction, secure hardware (like biometrics and YubiKey) and software (like APIs for programmatic text and email) into the user experience.</em></p></li></ul><p>Today, we&#8217;re stuck with a weird compromise: enter a password and <em>then </em>do the thing that&#8217;s actually secure, like scanning a face, entering a texted passcode, or clicking a magic link in an email or text. The second factor hasn&#8217;t eliminated the first. In fact, thanks to the COVID-induced mass online migration, all of us are juggling 25% <em>more</em> passwords now than we were in 2019&#8230;&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1dbf93f-02ca-445e-ba7c-dca2b2036f43_1600x1305.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1dbf93f-02ca-445e-ba7c-dca2b2036f43_1600x1305.png" width="1456" height="1188" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d1dbf93f-02ca-445e-ba7c-dca2b2036f43_1600x1305.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1188,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1dbf93f-02ca-445e-ba7c-dca2b2036f43_1600x1305.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1dbf93f-02ca-445e-ba7c-dca2b2036f43_1600x1305.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1dbf93f-02ca-445e-ba7c-dca2b2036f43_1600x1305.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1dbf93f-02ca-445e-ba7c-dca2b2036f43_1600x1305.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>&#8230; and we forget them, a lot.

Many of the major headline-grabbing hacks of the past year have been due to the vulnerabilities that passwords create. The Solar Winds and Colonial Pipeline hacks earlier this year both involved password weaknesses, and <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/?CMP=OOH_SMB_OTH_22222_MC_20200501_NA_NM20200079_00001">81%</a> of all internet breaches can be traced back to weak or stolen passwords.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond hacks, though, <strong>passwords are bad for business</strong>. According to Stytch, 75% of people who click &#8220;forgot password&#8221; abandon whatever they were trying to do. Reed told me:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>Passwords are an extremely high-friction hoop that we make users jump through, and this friction creates drop-off in both user sign-up and login flows, <strong>directly hitting companies key metrics like customer acquisition cost (CAC) and user life-time value (LTV).</strong>&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>It&#8217;s no wonder. This diagram that Reed and Julianna shared with me shows the process that people typically need to go through to reset their password:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&#8203;&#8203;</p><p>To be fair, that&#8217;s <em>exactly </em>what someone trying to kill the password would say and <em>exactly </em>the diagram they would share.

Sometimes you reset your password. Sometimes you say nevermind.&nbsp;</p><p>Authentication is such a crucial challenge for Plaid because its customers rely on Plaid&#8217;s APIs to connect with <em>their</em> user&#8217;s most sensitive information, their bank account details, which also happens to be mission critical to how Plaid&#8217;s customers make money. No bank account connection, no funded accounts, no transactions, no revenue. That means that Reed, Julianna, and their teams had to optimize both for <strong>security</strong> and for <strong>user experience</strong>. They couldn&#8217;t let hackers in, but they also couldn&#8217;t keep people from connecting their bank accounts. As Reed explained it:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>As Julianna and I worked on an array of projects focused on improving both the security and conversion in bank account authentication, we realized that our biggest security and user experience headaches all stemmed from the same technological relic: <strong>the password</strong>.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>And anytime we had to build anything related to authentication, we found ourselves building the authentication features out internally because <strong>none of the incumbent solutions had a flexible enough product</strong> to enable what we wanted to do.</em></p></blockquote><p>When Julianna left to go to Very Good Security as a Product Manager in 2019, she found the same challenges awaiting her. &#8220;I ran into many of the exact same authentication headaches,&#8221; she said, &#8220;as we migrated away from a large incumbent vendor (Auth0) to an in-house authentication solution due to the inflexibility of Auth0&#8217;s product.&#8221;</p><p>That&#8217;s not necessarily a criticism of Auth0. The product does what it was designed to do. It&#8217;s a widget that&#8217;s really easy to plug in. It is, however, a criticism of our nemesis: the password. Because Auth0 is built for a world of password-based authentication, it&#8217;s actually wise to push customers to use widgets hosted by Auth0 so that the customer never has to tough or store sensitive credentials. The challenge for Auth0 is that we&#8217;re moving to a passwordless world.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cc806a2-42a0-4870-b933-0f596e3de760_904x508.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cc806a2-42a0-4870-b933-0f596e3de760_904x508.png" width="904" height="508" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5cc806a2-42a0-4870-b933-0f596e3de760_904x508.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:508,&quot;width&quot;:904,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cc806a2-42a0-4870-b933-0f596e3de760_904x508.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cc806a2-42a0-4870-b933-0f596e3de760_904x508.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cc806a2-42a0-4870-b933-0f596e3de760_904x508.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cc806a2-42a0-4870-b933-0f596e3de760_904x508.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Get rid of the password, and you get rid of the concern around storing sensitive user data. In the passwordless world, you can design flexible, developer-friendly products and let developers figure out where and how they want to authenticate users in a way that fits their specific product.&nbsp;</p><p>That&#8217;s the world that Julianna and Reed decided to explore. After Julianna left Plaid, the two kept in touch and met up for coffee every month or so. In December 2019, over one such coffee, they shared their ongoing frustration with passwords and the lack of a &#8220;Stripe for Authentication,&#8221; a simple, flexible product that developers love and that improves the end user&#8217;s experiences on the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>They spent the next six months researching.

They were wasting sprint cycles and valuable engineering resources building their own authentication flows in-house.&nbsp;</p><p>So in June 2020, they quit their great jobs and founded Stytch. I&#8217;d encourage you to listen to the fireside chat that Gaurav and I had with Reed and Julianna to hear the story of the 0 to 1 founders&#8217; journey in their own words:&nbsp;</p><iframe class="spotify-wrap podcast" data-attrs="{&quot;image&quot;:&quot;https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6765630000ba8a35af1a7d15e56d0c49455112&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Not Boring Founders: Reed McGinley-Stempel &amp; Julianna Lamb, Stytch&quot;,&quot;subtitle&quot;:&quot;By Packy McCormick&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Podcast episode&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.spotify.com/episode/20Hl1SjRXJBIG9mysVkc46&quot;}" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/20Hl1SjRXJBIG9mysVkc46" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe><p>So what are they building?&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Meet Stytch: A Friction Reduction Company</strong></h3><p>Remember earlier when we talked about 2010 as the decade of two-factor authentication? And pointed out that the first factor (passwords) is bad and the real magic happens with the second factor? What if we got rid of passwords and started with those second factors?&nbsp;</p><p>Companies like Slack, Square Cash, Medium, Monzo, and Revolut have already embraced the opportunity to go passwordless. I still remember signing up for Slack for the first time and getting my magic link to log in without a password. It was&#8230; magical. Those companies had to build those experiences in-house. They can afford it, and they have some of the world&#8217;s best engineers.</p><p>Stytch builds really easy ways for <em>any</em> developer to create authentication experiences that improve security and reduce friction. In fact, in our fireside chat, Reed mentioned that internally, Stytch refers to itself as a <strong>friction reduction company</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>To accelerate this passwordless future, they&#8217;ve built an extensive platform for user management and passwordless authentication so that companies can stitch together (get it?) the authentication methods and user experiences that make

Stytch is adding new products at an alarmingly fast velocity, filling the toy chest with more and more blocks.&nbsp;</p><p>That speed and breadth, combined with the API-First approach, is Stytch&#8217;s strategic angle of attack.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>API-First as a Competitive Advantage in the Race to Replace the Password</strong></p><p>Sometimes, for the companies that I write about, the main competition is the <strong>build vs. buy decision</strong>. That&#8217;s the case for <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/modern-treasury-the-quadrillion-quest">Modern Treasury</a>, for example. Customers decide whether they want to build something in-house or use a focused company&#8217;s software or APIs.&nbsp;</p><p>Other times, there&#8217;s intense <strong>direct competition</strong>. The opportunity has become obvious enough that both incumbents and well-funded startups compete to win. Passwordless is such an opportunity.&nbsp;</p><p>Stytch believes that a developer-friendly API-first offering with a robust offering of passwordless products is the best way to win. The logic to both is that customers will want to build authentication experiences and user infrastructure that makes sense for their own end-user customers, and that the dominant approach is to arm those companies with everything they need.&nbsp;</p><p>To win the market, they&#8217;ll need to overcome a series of foes.&nbsp;</p><p>The 800 pound gorilla in the space is Auth0, which we discussed earlier. Auth0 is a much, much larger company than Stytch, with a reported $200 million in revenue at the time of the Okta acquisition. It&#8217;s impossible to dismiss Auth0, particularly with the customers they already have and the financial and distribution support Okta provides, but Auth0 has made trade-offs that do not seem best suited for the current landscape, stemming from their belief in passwords.

Stytch believes that by building API-first, Julianna told me, &#8220;<strong>We can enable so many rich, flexible user experiences that wouldn&#8217;t be possible if we only built and sold front-end widgets for authentication.</strong>&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>As an example, she told me about <a href="http://olla.co">Olla</a>, a &#8220;Shopify for cannabis dispensaries,&#8221; that offers an out-of-the-box user-facing checkout and payment experience. Olla&#8217;s merchant customers can avoid offering a &#8220;guest checkout&#8221; experience by making it really easy for their customers to <strong>create an account right at the moment of checkout</strong>. It&#8217;s the <strong>best of both worlds</strong>: they don&#8217;t introduce any extra friction until the customer is ready to checkout, and they&#8217;re able to enroll them in loyalty programs and marketing campaigns and save their payment information for smoother checkout and higher conversion.</p><p>The beautiful part is that Olla&#8217;s use case isn&#8217;t one the Stytch team ever anticipated. Invoking the movie <em>Interstellar</em> (one of Reed&#8217;s favorites, he&#8217;ll tell you more if you sign up for <a href="https://stytch.com/">Stytch</a>), Reed explained the philosophical rationale for building API-first:</p><blockquote><p><em>The reason why flexible API-first companies can be so successful is based on a similar premise: <strong>serendipity is one of the most powerful building blocks for developer platforms</strong>. You&#8217;re exposing helpful <strong>primitives</strong> to developers so that they can build better products. If you limit yourself to building widgets, it&#8217;s still possible to build quite large companies, but you&#8217;ll always be limiting the <strong>serendipity on your platform and the ability for your customers to discover and enable new useful applications of your technology that you wouldn&#8217;t have otherwise predicted</strong>.</em></p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8fe42ea1-bb0d-4d0d-867a-cdcd709e98b1_961x508.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8fe42ea1-bb0d-4d0d-867a-cdcd709e98b1_961x508.png" width="961" height="508" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8fe42ea1-bb0d-4d0d-867a-cdcd709e98b1_961x508.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:508,&quot;width&quot;:961,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8fe42ea1-bb0d-4d0d-867a-cdcd709e98b1_961x508.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8fe42ea1-bb0d-4d0d-867a-cdcd709e98b1_961x508.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8fe42ea1-bb0d-4d0d-867a-cdcd709e98b1_961x508.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8fe42ea1-bb0d-4d0d-867a-cdcd709e98b1_961x508.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>API-first will win here.

One differentiator is that Magic seems to be more focused on web3 companies -- it lists Decrypt, Polymarket, and fairmint on its home page -- whereas Stytch hasn&#8217;t doubled down on a particular segment. While I&#8217;m obviously all-in on web3, larger web2 and enterprise clients may be more attracted to Stytch&#8217;s current more neutral stance.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, <strong>Stytch plans to support web3 projects and apps very soon</strong>, with planned MetaMask and Phantom integrations, and APIs that give web3 developers the choice to add both custodial options, like OAuth with trusted providers like Coinbase, FTX, Google, or Apple, and non-custodial options, like wallet sign in. That may serve as an important tool for mainstream adoption.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, this battle will come down to who can build out the best suite of products, fastest, and convince the most developers to build with their APIs. I like Stytch&#8217;s odds.&nbsp;</p><p>I don&#8217;t know Magic&#8217;s growth, but I do know that <strong>Stytch has grown 10x from 350 developers on the platform at the Series A announcement to 3,500 now</strong>, just 4 months later. Certainly, Stytch&#8217;s new $90 million in funding coupled with its proven ability to hire world-class talent gives it an edge. In the race against Magic, the combination of speed, quality, and relentless focus on the developer will matter.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Why Stytch Wins</strong></h3><p>The company that I&#8217;ve written about that Stytch reminds me the most of is <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/ramps-double-unicorn-rounds-behind">Ramp</a>. The products are different, Ramp isn&#8217;t API-first, and it primarily sells to the finance team, so it&#8217;s not those things. It&#8217;s a combination of <strong>velocity and stability</strong> that&#8217;s very hard to find.&nbsp;</p><p>Stytch ships products and hires world-class talent at an alarmingly fast clip, but it never feels like things are out of control. It&#8217;s simultaneously ferocious and calm.</p><p>That&#8217;s a testament to the founders. When I asked Gaurav what most impressed him about Stytch, he told me that each Reed and Julianna &#8220;evolve every three months into a new founder.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>First, it was just the two of them, spending six months on research before diving in. Then, they were running a small team of eight high-caliber engineers and designers. Now, they&#8217;re thinking like organization builders. Our fireside chat was a lesson in how to think about hiring a world-class team, which they&#8217;ve done, and in how to stay ahead of the curve. Now, they&#8217;re Series B founders at the helm of a 27-employee unicorn.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Febcb02ab-0c00-4f02-86c1-c639be5394a7_766x516.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Febcb02ab-0c00-4f02-86c1-c639be5394a7_766x516.png" width="766" height="516" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ebcb02ab-0c00-4f02-86c1-c639be5394a7_766x516.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:516,&quot;width&quot;:766,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Febcb02ab-0c00-4f02-86c1-c639be5394a7_766x516.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Febcb02ab-0c00-4f02-86c1-c639be5394a7_766x516.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Febcb02ab-0c00-4f02-86c1-c639be5394a7_766x516.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Febcb02ab-0c00-4f02-86c1-c639be5394a7_766x516.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Stytch&#8217;s Growing Team</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>And as of today, they&#8217;ve made their <strong>first acquisition</strong>: <strong><a href="https://www.cotter.app/">Cotter</a></strong>.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45e0d1ce-43a5-42d5-acc8-a44bfd3135fe_1237x349.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45e0d1ce-43a5-42d5-acc8-a44bfd3135fe_1237x349.png" width="1237" height="349" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/45e0d1ce-43a5-42d5-acc8-a44bfd3135fe_1237x349.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:349,&quot;width&quot;:1237,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45e0d1ce-43a5-42d5-acc8-a44bfd3135fe_1237x349.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45e0d1ce-43a5-42d5-acc8-a44bfd3135fe_1237x349.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45e0d1ce-43a5-42d5-acc8-a44bfd3135fe_1237x349.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45e0d1ce-43a5-42d5-acc8-a44bfd3135fe_1237x349.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Cotter did Y Combinator in the winter 2020 batch and built a product that was particularly focused on building passwordless authentication tools for no- and low-code platforms like Webflow and Bubble. After dealing with all of the no- and low-code platforms first-hand, they saw an opportunity to build their own: <a href="https://typedream.com/">Typedream</a> (a Not Boring Capital portfolio company).</p><p>Julianna and Reed had built a relationship with the Cotter founders, and when they began moving towards Typedream, they started talking about whether it would make sense for Stytch to acquire Cotter&#8217;s assets so that the team could focus fully on the new vision.&nbsp;</p><p>Reed and Julianna weren&#8217;t over-exuberant in their explanation of the acquisition. They thought rationally about what it could do to help Stytch accelerate the product roadmap. Specifically, while they&#8217;re not committing to no- and low-code products, the acquisition &#8220;has given us a great input into our future roadmap there and simple blueprints for how we might compete in the future in those markets.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>That encapsulates why I&#8217;m so bullish on Stytch: <strong>deliberation then speed then serendipity</strong>.</p><p>A bet on Stytch is a bet that offering a wide range of secure modalities in a way that&#8217;s frictionless to developers first, and then to those developers&#8217; end-users, is how to acquire the most customers. It&#8217;s also a bet that an API-first approach that leaves room for serendipity and emergent use cases will give Stytch the most surface area on the internet. Giving customers the tools to build exactly what they want will ultimately beat monolithic, prescriptive solutions.&nbsp;</p><p>Already, Stytch is winning customers away from Auth0 and improving their core businesses. Yesterday, they released a <a href="https://stytch.com/blog/lighthouse-case-study/">case study on Lighthouse</a>, a next-generation apartment rental platform that switched from Auth0 to Stytch. By going passwordless and creating a mobile-first authentication flow that Lighthouse was able to design to match their users&#8217; actions, the company saw a <strong>62% improvement in its sign up conversion rate</strong>.</p><p>Examples like that are why Reed and Julianna think that the opportunity is so much bigger than Auth0&#8217;s $6.5 billion acquisition. They believe both Auth0 and Okta have dramatically underestimated the market:</p><blockquote><p><em>Authentication is a huge market and growing quickly, but we think the <strong>incumbent companies haven't tapped into a lot of the latent opportunity here</strong>, particularly if improved authentication can also <strong>improve a company's core business metrics</strong> like we've seen passwordless do for our customers.</em></p></blockquote><p>Building API-first and offering the most complete menu of options, the TL;DR of Stytch&#8217;s strategy, means leaving space for customers to uncover all of the latent opportunities on Stytch&#8217;s behalf.&nbsp;</p><p>As customers uncover those opportunities, Stytch grows. And as Stytch grows, it unlocks the opportunity to go after the really big vision.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>The Big Vision&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Imagine having a <strong>Passport for the Internet</strong>.</p><p>That&#8217;s the vision that Reed and Julianna laid out the first time we spoke back in February: to do for onboarding what Shop Pay has done for checkout.</p><p>They could achieve that in a few different ways.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Passively</strong>, imagine logging into one account in a product that uses Stytch and automatically logging into any other Stytch-powered site via a recognized device.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Actively, </strong>imagine that Stytch builds up the equivalent of a passwordless password manager that picks up all of your authentications in the background and uses that to seamlessly log you into those sites in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>In either case, once Stytch adds web3-support, your Stytch Passport could be a fluid way to traverse across the whole internet, web2 and web3.&nbsp;</p><p>That would be a magical end-user experience, and it would also be a strong selling point for the next big enterprise client: &#8220;Would you like our 50 million users to be able to automatically log in to your site? Oh by the way, when your customers don&#8217;t need to think about logging in, we can dramatically improve your conversion and drive top-line growth.&#8221; Sold.&nbsp;</p><p>With each new client, the network would get stronger, as would the pitch to the next big client, and the one after that, until Stytch wins the internet, and takes a miniscule fee on every log in along the way.&nbsp;</p><p>It starts with killing the password, but it ends up much bigger than anyone could imagine.</p><div><hr></div><p>How did you like this week&#8217;s Not Boring?
