For me personally, a framework/mental model provides for efficiency and an easy filtering process. </p><p>Let&#8217;s discuss the key criterion. As a reminder, this is a framework for public companies rather than private companies and everyone will have a different style.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>1. Revenue growth (30% - 40%+): </strong></h4><p><em>Why is high Revenue growth important? - </em>Revenue growth is the most obsessed metric used by all growth investors and rightly so. However, the reason this metric is heavily used is that in most cases revenue growth indicates that a company is doing something right - either its product or the distribution. Although there are ways companies may have temporal highs of growth like the 2020 pandemic, the companies that maintain a consistent cadence of growth at least over 30% for long stretches generally prove they have a product-market fit (depending on the maturity of the business).</p><p><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/grow-fast-or-die-slow?s=03">According to Mckinsey&#8217;s research</a> of 3000 software companies over 20-years, they found that consistent high revenue growth was a theme of the best companies. I quote the report:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>In our new research, we analyzed the life cycles of about 3,000 software and online-services companies from around the globe between 1980 and 2012</em>. <em><strong>High-growth companies offer a return to shareholders five times greater than medium-growth compani</strong>es. Second, growth predicts long-term success.</em>&nbsp; <em>High rates of growth are a predictor of long-term success. We analyzed the 96 companies that reached $1 billion in annual sales and found that fully 85 percent were in the top two categories of growth (super growers and growers) when the companies were smaller.&#8221; </em></p></blockquote><p>The Mckinsey report suggests there is evidence to support the thesis that Revenue growth should be a starting metric for evaluating the success of a company before other metrics. A product that has great product-market fit demonstrates the company is solving a problem that resonates with its customer base.</p><p>ARR is the golden standard for SaaS companies. It is a slightly better metric to get a good understanding of the appetite of customers for the product. There is a difference between bookings, billings, and ARR before interpreting the core revenue growth for software businesses. One of those metrics might matter over the other depending on the business. For companies that have larger TCV (Contract value) and a large customer base - It&#8217;s better to focus more on billings, and for SMB&#8217;s/mid-sized company products that don&#8217;t have a high price tag - focus more on ARR. However, note that this varies from B2B/B2C SaaS. In this article, we will focus on Revenue.&nbsp;</p><p>From all the studies I have covered, the key three things that matter for assessing Revenue growth for public companies are: i) Recurring Revenue ii) Acceleration in revenue growth or mild deceleration iii) Durability of that growth. The goal is to find companies growing over &gt;30% - 40% consistently. The best of class growth companies usually keep growth high (from the Mckinsey study) which is why I have a minimum hurdle of 30% growth, some companies even grow over 50% - 70% for a long stretch of time spanning multiple years. E.g. Shopify has a 5-yr CAGR of almost 70% growth.&nbsp;The key features of growth include:"</p><ul><li><p><strong>Recurring</strong>: The goal is to identify companies with over 80%+ Recurring Revenue. This ensures that a company has significant visibility and predictability into its future revenue. This is 90% the case for SaaS. I prefer companies that have consumption-based or variable-based pricing over subscriptions for certain business models like data infrastructure companies.&nbsp;</p><p></p></li><li><p><strong>Acceleration + Execution (&gt;7-10% beat + raise %)</strong>: This is one of my biggest lessons in 2020/2021. This is what wall street uses to reward or discount valuations. Track how a company is accelerating revenue growth rates on a <strong>quarter-over-quarter (QoQ)</strong> basis then secondarily look at the year-over-year (YoY) growth rates. The reason is that QoQ tracks the true health and momentum of a business than the YoY gains. It is important to mention that not all companies can keep accelerating every single year or Quarter. All great companies eventually decelerate, stabilize, or re-accelerate. One thing I&#8217;ve learned is that you want to avoid any *huge* deceleration or a persistent drop, and a slowdown in revenue or customer metrics. This is usually a red flag. The market begins to discount/re-rate such companies immediately and it loses its premium valuation because in many cases, this is usually the beginning of a trend either because the business lost a significant customer eg. Fastly in 2020 or a loss in key talent/asset. Meanwhile, best of breed/premium companies have elements of high acceleration and moderate deceleration.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The second component to track is a company&#8217;s execution against its own guidance. Ideally, you want to track the percentage % of a company&#8217;s beat in the current, next quarters guide and historical EPS/Revenue beat to avoid being caught off guard by companies that are highly conservative with guidance. Generally, any beat rate over 7-10% is considered excellent. This signifies that a company is hitting its objectives, internal business goals and this almost always predicts a positive stock movement barring any other factor in the quarter.&nbsp;</p><p></p></li><li><p><strong>Durability</strong>: Lastly, it is important to think hard about the durability of a company&#8217;s growth rates and assess if this is a one-time pull forward in growth. All companies will eventually face a slowdown in revenue growth over time; however, the best companies are generally able to sustain growth in the high-20s or low 30s &amp; 40s at a large scale. Durability and ability to compound revenue growth over say a 10-year period is a function of a company&#8217;s product superiority, competitive advantage/differentiation relative to its competition (many of the factors which are discussed in-depth later). Additionally, it is important to evaluate a company&#8217;s optionality and ease at which they can develop new products to expand their TAM because this ultimately leads to growth sustainability longer-term. More discussion on this later.&nbsp;</p><p></p></li></ul><h4><strong>2. Margins/Unit Economics:</strong></h4><ul><li><p><strong>Gross Margins are different</strong>. I lean towards companies with 70% gross margins and ideally over 80% LT Gross margin potential. Also, prefer companies that have a clear roadmap of achieving that metric within 3-5 years. Generally, Gross margins multiples are a better measure of a business&#8217;s future profitability and it shows the business has leverage in the sense that there are fewer humans involved in the process. Some context on Gross margins for SaaS. Many SaaS companies pay the major cloud providers to allow them to run their software like Snowflake (close to 68% margins), or cybersecurity companies that require high amounts of computing resources. Meanwhile, there are platforms like Asana and Monday (Gross Margins of over 90%) that have their own abstraction layer which doesn&#8217;t require a full expense to the cloud providers. The higher the gross margins, the higher the likelihood will be able to generate profits for shareholders. Every business is unique.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Operating Margins:</strong>&nbsp; Find companies that are GAAP Profitable or have NGAAP Operating margins of at least &gt;10-20%. This is very difficult in today&#8217;s market where businesses are funded by VC&#8217;s and capital markets to grow at all costs. Generally, I am comfortable owning a company with at least negative -20-30% margins -- depending on the context of the product, improving operating leverage, and if the competitive moat significantly shows that the business unit economics can be profitable in the near future. For example, Salesforce has never really been GAAP profitable but its product moat in CRM is undisputed or MongoDB has high LTV to CAC within the database market, but decide to focus more on acquiring more customers now. </p><p></p><p>Within the operating and EBITDA Margins, other key metrics to track here are S&amp;M Efficiency and R&amp;D Per Revenue Dollar. The average SaaS company spends heavily on S&amp;M and it generally makes up their largest expense bucket. They want to acquire enough customers to capture as much of their TAM as quickly as possible. Secondly, due to the fight for talent, profitability for many of these SaaS companies is elusive due to high stock-based compensation.&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is to track the unit economics of the underlying business to understand if the business can truly be profitable (or generate significant cash-flows) long-term if they decide to turn off the taps on Op-ex and Cap-ex. </p><p></p></li></ul><h4><strong>3. Sales Efficiency - S&amp;M CAC to LTV ARR:</strong> </h4><p>Sales efficiency is an often-overlooked metric in a world that prioritizes growth. There are two ways I approach tracking this methodology. First, the easy one is tracking companies that have Sales &amp; Marketing (S&amp;M) cost growing faster than revenue growth consistently over many quarters, or don&#8217;t have a high difference between S&amp;M growth to revenue growth is a red flag. It means a company is burning cash in S&amp;M but is inefficient in its process of sales. The greater the difference in S&amp;M to revenue growth, the better leverage. For example, Datadog in their Q3 2021 Qtr grew revenue over 80% and yet their S&amp;M expense only increased 40% which shows high leverage. This S&amp;M to Revenue section should be within the context of the size of the company/product type. If revenue growth cannot keep up ahead of S&amp;M growth, this is a sign that the company needs to fix its sales teams/account executives/reward incentive and go-to-market strategy.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Gross Margin Adjusted CAC Payback: </strong>This is the second metric used. CAC payback pretty much tries to detect how long it takes for a company to generate gross profits from customers based on its S&amp;M CAC expenses. It signals how efficient a company can be with its sales employees. + CAC can be calculated as (Last Quarter&#8217;s S&amp;M) / (Net New ARR x Gross Margin) x 12. Some companies have longer payback periods depending on their gross margins or the company&#8217;s sales cycle. The LTV/CAC calculation can be derived by using: (Change in Subscription Gross Profit Dollars / Incremental S&amp;M expenses) x (1 / Churn x Discount Rate) x (New Customers / Total Customers).&nbsp;In general, the key evaluation here is &#8220;How much did the S&amp;M units (inclusive of all programs and personnel) spend compared to how much New Sales ARR or Net New ARR from new customers was generated in the quarter or year.&#8221; The ARR or TCV generated should be higher than they spend. David Sacks at Craft Ventures has a metric called the Magic number, &#8220;<em>Magic Number: Magic Number is the Net New ARR in a period divided by S&amp;M expense from the prior period. Ideally, the ratio is greater than one</em>.&#8221;</p></li></ul><p></p><h4><strong>4. Customer growth + Dollar-based Net Retention (DBNRR): </strong></h4><p>Steady customer growth is almost the food that sustains a business. Customers provide lifeline. The baseline is to see a healthy 30-40% customer growth. The younger the business, the higher the growth is expected in this early stage to avoid high customer concentration/business risks.&nbsp;</p><p>DBNRR can be described as the revenue a cohort of customers provides to a business in each period relative to their original subscription. It almost measures engagement and usage. This metric takes into consideration customer churn. Many public companies don&#8217;t disclose churn. Ideally, a phenomenal SaaS business has a strong suite of products that they can upsell/cross-sell, land &amp; expand and have strong pricing power. For example, Twilio (140%), Crowdstrike (&gt;120%), and Datadog (&gt;130%) have maintained high retention rates consistently for multiple years in a row. Generally, these businesses are able to deliver a minimum of 20% growth every year without adding a single new customer. Generally, you want to find businesses that have optionality and those that invest in specific post-sales constructs to increase upsell and retention amongst customers. Dollar Retention of less than 100% won&#8217;t usually be disclosed by a company.  A DBNRR metric hovering around 100% is a sign that a product is not sticky and the business is experiencing churn. However, strong customer growth and high net retention are drivers of durable revenue at scale.&nbsp; As a rule of thumb - generally, the higher the DBNRR, the higher the LTV of the customer base. They prove there is an efficient GTM land &amp; expand strategy and that customer churn/health is healthy.</p><p>In summary, financial execution is a combination of long-term revenue and steady state margins which include an efficient sales strategy complimented by customer growth. </p><h2>The Top 7 Competitive Moats And Product Advantages:</h2><p>Moats are core attributes associated with a business. A company's sustainable competitive advantage over competitors. An economic moat can fend off competition and enable a company earn high returns on capital for multiple years.</p><p>The best businesses have <strong>sustainable</strong> and <strong>durable</strong> competitive advantages. There will always be competition, but these companies have a distinguishable edge that drive long-term margins.&nbsp;</p><p>Essentially, the greatest businesses have generally exhibited at least one or two of the following characteristics predominately. They have either an element of high-switching costs, an intangible asset/brand, network effect, or cost advantage that leads to economies of scale. In software and B2B SaaS, the following moats include software defensibility, counter positioning, data network effect/network economies, cornered resources (unique talent/valuable resource over competitors), and process power. Readers interested in <a href="https://nandu.substack.com/p/modern-software-moats?r=414hy&amp;utm_source=url">software moats</a> can read this piece.&nbsp;I will discuss the core lessons that have shaped my process:</p><h4><strong>1. The durability of Product Moat/Differentiation</strong>: </h4><p>The goal to evaluate the key differentiators of the company&#8217;s product and determine if those differentiators are enough to help counter position or undercut their competitors to capture a good section of their TAM. Differentiation might appear in the form of a unique brand, popularity amongst a loyal customer like Open source software that appeals to developers, or a unique process/IP that a company has developed that is different than competitors. In many cases, it is hard to build something &#8216;extremely unique&#8217; in SaaS, so a company&#8217;s advantage might be their first-mover advantage, distribution, and/or differentiated product development process/speed. </p><p>Importantly, it is <strong>important to assess the durability, longevity</strong>, and <strong>barriers to entry</strong> to a company&#8217;s product moat. For example, Zoom&#8217;s product had a perceived moat in 2020 at the height of the pandemic but over time, the durability of that moat started to dissipate because the barrier to entry for video communication was relatively low and distribution channels were weak hence they could not find ways to distribute their product across enterprises as easily as Google and Microsoft did as the pandemic dissipated. A product moat may come in the form of accumulation of data, a significant amount of capital/knowledge/time to build infrastructure to build the business like Z-Scaler's unique cloud network in ZIA/ZIP built across the globe, or it may be the way a company delivers its products and counter position its peers like offering a superior product relative to competitors for a cheaper price e.g. Salesforce did to Siebel when it changed its pricing strategy from paying per-user to a flexible strategy of pay-as-you-go. I highly recommend using platforms like Teagus, Gartner/Forrester reports, G2 Product ratings/Gartner Voice of the customer to assess real product strengths. In general, you want companies that have a differentiated edge with high barrier to entries.</p><h4><strong>2. Essential/Mission Critical: </strong></h4><p>The product is highly essential to the underlying business. It is critical whereby if the company did not have the product - it could affect their bottom-lines either by minimizing revenue opportunities or driving cost high. e.g. Think about the impact of not having cybersecurity protection (cost savings) or think of a CRM system for tracking leads (revenue driver). These types of software products are extremely difficult to rip off, and it serves as almost an oxygen layer for the business. Whereby products that are more like features, point solutions or have lots of substitute products are very vulnerable to cycles or changing customer preferences which affect the underlying revenue and margin profile.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>3. High Switching Costs: </strong></h4><p>This is a highly important business characteristic that has defined many of the great software businesses. For example, one of the key moats that are common amongst oracle, salesforce, and ServiceNow in that order is the high level of switching costs associated with the ripping off their software. I&#8217;m attracted to companies that have significant friction to the removal or displacing of their products. This friction boils down to the difficulty of the time, energy, resources, and information required to displace the product once it has been installed. The best SaaS companies develop a good process that balances relative ease of adoption/minimized sales cycle to a product that once it has been installed, it becomes difficult to uninstall e.g. MongoDB makes it easy to adopt, but once you have most of the data built on their database, the costs of removal mostly outweigh the benefits the longer one uses it. The benefit of this moat is that if a company has great product-market fit and customer experience, the company can create a high pricing power on its customer base. The product doesn&#8217;t easily get replaced, so you build a loyal customer base and if the company can add incremental features, re-invest into new products, they can easily get the customer to pay more and this can lead to tremendous success/durable revenue growth over time. The best example is how Atlassian built a strong product-led growth and spent most of its operating expenses on R&amp;D to develop new products and annually, they have raised prices by double digits without experiencing churn. Another great case study is Datadog that protects a company&#8217;s infrastructure services which makes it highly sticky and hard to replace. </p><p></p><h4><strong>4. Platform Ecosystem/Network Effect: </strong></h4><p>As <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-bill-gates-line/">Bill Gates line</a> defines platform effects &#8220;<em>A platform is when the economic value of everybody that uses it, exceeds the value of the company that creates it</em>.&#8221;<strong> </strong>Marketplaces with their network effects are some of the best examples. In this SaaS example, a platform criterion in my definition measures if a company&#8217;s platform can serve as an infrastructure for the building of other applications or systems on top of it. Once things can be built on that platform, can it facilitate sales, transitions, and the exchange of knowledge?&nbsp;</p><p>This builds upon my point about mission-critical and switching costs criteria for analyzing businesses. Platform ecosystems allow for significant value creation, for example, open-source applications have large communities of product users, developers, and evangelists - who love a product, are committed to improving it, and build applications on those products.&nbsp;An anecdotal evidence from a newsletter, I highly recommend<a href="https://nandu.substack.com/p/modern-software-moats?r=414hy&amp;utm_source=url"> Nandu Substack</a>, &#8220;<em>This <a href="https://stateofstartups2019.firstround.com/">First Round 2019 survey</a> showed that &#8220;nearly 80% of founders reported building a community of users as important to their business, with 28% describing it as their moat and critical to their succes</em>s.&#8221;&nbsp; &nbsp;There is significant organic marketing that happens here. For example: Confluent is an example based on its open-source product Kafka. Similarly, Cloudflare has built an edge platform and their CDN network/distributed servers globally that makes it easy for developers to build products using Cloudflare as their core infrastructure. The natural inherent benefit of building a platform ecosystem is the network effects that emanate from it and the eventual switching cost it creates once you&#8217;ve built applications and systems on it eg. Jira for Atlassian marketplace + ecosystem for developers, Salesforce marketplace + user ecosystem. Enterprise network effects are created if the experience and value for your customers get better as more customers join in. Businesses with app stores or marketplaces have exhibited this characteristic. Good examples include companies like Salesforce transforming their platform from a core CRM to allowing developers to build upon it. Finally, a&nbsp; great platform ecosystem naturally breeds optionality for a business to expand or cross-sell into newer areas.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>5. Scalability</strong>: </h4><p>Products that have the capability of scaling across thousands of customers within an organization with a single installation. There are no incremental costs of providing extra elements of the product across an organization or for more customers. One example is the cloud providers like Microsoft Azure that can deliver cloud across thousands of clients at a profitable scale i.e. they have a core infrastructure that has almost no extra marginal cost to scale. On a relative level, enterprise B2B SaaS companies have this leverage over customer/DTC businesses.&nbsp; On a relative level, enterprise B2B SaaS companies have this leverage over customer/DTC businesses. Technologies such as infrastructure or database products benefit from this scalability effects across wide levels of customers due to the leverage of the cloud. Although, Netflix is B2C business, but think about how Netflix has over 222 million subscribers and spreads the cost of an original content across all of that customer base using varying subscription levels</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>6. The Go-To-Market Strategy (GTM)</strong>: </h4><p>Distribution is everything in today&#8217;s digital economy. It is extremely important to assess the go-to-market motion. Distribution is ultimately key for selling a great product and generating sales.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There are two broad categories of GTM. First, they can be top-down, enterprise-wide products such as Z-Scaler that require CTO/executive final decisions to decide the final sale decision. In this case, investors want to assess the companies partner ecosystem - does the company have partnerships with the largest players that control the industry or have the right channel ecosystem partners/system integrators that have key selling access to 70% of your ideal customer base?. The second type of GTM is a bottom-up - developer/user-led growth strategy and somewhat product-led organic growth. In this strategy, Investors want to assess if the company already has a strong community of loyal users that love/advocate the product, assess if there is evidence of product-led growth - e.g. does the company easy sign-up/freemium/trial process that involves a less number of sales reps?. The reason is that the decision-makers are more driven by developers or employees or referrals /WOM who have easy access to the product. Companies like Shopify developed huge success with users or Cloudflare that started from bottoms-up to now a hybrid product-led sales motion that combines tactics for driving user decisions and they have account executives who focus on large-scale enterprise sales at the top. Ideally, users/developers like the product and recommend it to their managers/executives.&nbsp; If the product is something that could be easily purchased from the website without having to involve a sales rep/account executive, the better e.g. Atlassian generated most of its success, over 90% of all sales happen online.&nbsp;</p><p>At this stage, track how the company lands new customers and expands with them over time. Some companies provide cohort analysis.&nbsp;The goal is to assess the GTM motion for the right stage of the company and align it to 1) Customer growth/DBNRR metrics and 2) CAC/S&amp;M to Revenue metrics to assess if the GTM strategy is working.</p><p></p><h4><strong>7. Management/Talent/Culture:</strong> </h4><p>Culture/specific talents are equal to or more important than management. As a hypergrowth company scales and grows fast, the more important talent becomes than the product. The people define everything.&nbsp; However, the first criteria are to evaluate the management team. What is management&#8217;s competitive advantage with regard to talent, skills, past track record, or experience? Do they have almost a chip on their shoulder? What is their skin in the game &amp; % of ownership?</p><p>Visit the company&#8217;s blog/Glassdoor and tech talent review sites to get a good sense of the culture. The key component of culture is to evaluate a company&#8217;s product cadence and innovation. The most successful SaaS companies build and execute products because every the incremental cost per unit for technology declines and competition always increases. The toleration for risk, a trial-and-error mindset is key to a company that can generate revenue and cash-flow at scale. Evaluate how quickly the company launches new products because this is ultimately key to driving most of the revenue growth discussions above. It is also important to track management&#8217;s ability to be consistent and to deliver what they promise either in their messaging on the earnings call, investor conferences, and interviews.&nbsp;Lastly, for SaaS companies, it is important to know where talent is flowing. Does the company consistently lose key talent? and/ are they attracting the best of talents? This is hard to track, but anecdotal evidence suggests the following shouldn&#8217;t be taken lightly because the inflow of top talent leads to great tech companies.&nbsp;</p><h4>8.  <strong>Structural Total Addressable Market (How durable is the trend?):</strong> </h4><p>Underlying everything has to be a broader addressable economic market that is big and growing. Assessing if there is a structural change happening whether across an industry, enterprise, or in the delivery/adoption of software. One-time tailwinds such as the rise in video calling in a pandemic can arguably be defined as pull-forward or temporal tailwinds but they cannot be compared to the type of structural tailwind that happens when companies discover new ways of storing information on the cloud rather than on-premises. The TAM should be growing in double digits. Generally, great SaaS companies are able to first create a niche or increase market share within a SAM (Sector Addressable Market) then go broad. Assessing the company&#8217;s market share/positioning within an industry is pivotal because certain companies have large TAM&#8217;s but don&#8217;t have the right business model or talent to profit from the market.&nbsp;</p><p></p><h2><strong>Valuation (Output):</strong></h2><p>Valuation reflects the profits a business can generate into the future. In my opinion, valuation is an output derived from the inputs above, a combination of financial execution, earnings quality, and business moat.</p><p>The biggest question is to evaluate the exit multiple you are willing to pay to own that business in 3-5 years&#8217; time if all the growth assumptions discussed above were to happen. SaaS Valuation can be difficult since many companies are unprofitable and trade at a premium to the market. The goal is to determine the IRR/minimum hurdle rate you&#8217;re willing to accept and evaluate it against the assumptions priced into the stock.&nbsp;An important caveat when calculating share price return profile is to incorporate the level of stock-based compensation dilution relative to the exit multiple/long-term growth profile. </p><p>It is important to remember that the best-in-class SaaS companies always trade a premium valuation because of their expected future growth profile, higher margin profile around CAC relative to LTV and a healthy customer growth + dollar-based net retention.</p><h2>Conclusion:</h2><p>Final questions might include - if you as an investor have an edge in the business? What are the key drivers and KPI&#8217;s to watch? What are your exit/sell criteria - perform a pre-mortem analysis and if you&#8217;ve developed a balanced bull and bear case analysis. Lastly, make sure you&#8217;ve developed full conviction for times of volatility will prove the depth of your due diligence.</p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Additional frameworks for Investing in Software:</strong></h3><p>I want to also provide a variety general frameworks that goes beyond my research/experiences to open the topic further.</p><p>First, this is a framework by Goldman Sachs research.

I am hoping this monthly reflection help to structure out my thoughts and rationale especially in a year where things will be difficult for Growth/SaaS style Investing. I&#8217;d hope this monthly recap helps people find new ideas, provide my subscribers with a little company deep-dive, and lastly, everyone provides me with some feedback on my thought process.</p><p>Every second weekend of the month (around the 10th of every month) you can expect to receive this review.  I will put effort into these monthly reviews with the hope that they provide some value-add to myself and everyone.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Portfolio Structure: </strong></h3><p>I manage two different portfolios. It&#8217;s important I provide some context to the natures of these portfolios, so everyone understands my decision-making process through the year.  My style is to find rapidly-growing software companies where the company fundamentals and competitive moat align with the valuation. My investment strategy is to buy and hold for the long term. However, my strategy also involves selling a company when my thesis is broken since I can&#8217;t predict if such a company will become the next Amazon or Apple. </p><p><strong>Portfolio 1:</strong> This is my core personal portfolio. It&#8217;s geared towards long-term bets. Funds that I don&#8217;t need in the near future, so I am likely to be more patient and long-term oriented. I&#8217;m slightly more passionate about the companies here.</p><p><strong>Portfolio 2:</strong> This is a family portfolio (OPM). I&#8217;m &#8216;fairly&#8217; conservative here with an asterisk. Strategy is a long-term buy-and-hold AC with companies with little risk and high-upside. However, I carefully monitor performance and will occasionally have &#8216;unusual&#8217; high-quality companies here that are Non-SaaS. My goal here is performance.</p><p><strong>Format</strong>: I will only comment on the Top 10-13 relevant companies across both portfolios as I don&#8217;t bore everyone to a lengthy monthly review. The structure for every company is to discuss a) Company&#8217;s competitive advantage since I believe this is durable for LT growth. b) The key catalysts for the stock/growth c) The key metrics that matter for the stock/move the thesis. It&#8217;s irrelevant to focus on everything. </p><h2><strong>January Portfolio:</strong></h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6a9f79a-e900-4218-8d48-82d25dc28512_757x627.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6a9f79a-e900-4218-8d48-82d25dc28512_757x627.png" width="757" height="627" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c6a9f79a-e900-4218-8d48-82d25dc28512_757x627.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:627,&quot;width&quot;:757,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:89369,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6a9f79a-e900-4218-8d48-82d25dc28512_757x627.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6a9f79a-e900-4218-8d48-82d25dc28512_757x627.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6a9f79a-e900-4218-8d48-82d25dc28512_757x627.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6a9f79a-e900-4218-8d48-82d25dc28512_757x627.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><strong>Key decisions in the month:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Buys: FTNT on Jan. 10; Increased DDOG, UPWK, ZS, PLTR, and DLO in Jan.</p></li><li><p>Temporal Exits: AMPL, SE, and MNDY in December, BILL on Jan. 9.

They provide their software to IT departments and development operations teams to help them monitor and observe their wide range of infrastructure. My thesis is that Datadog&#8217;s product is mission-critical for IT teams, not a luxury because of the huge costs associated with downtime or a crash in IT systems during operations. Secondly, Datadog&#8217;s high level of product innovation coupled with one of the best SaaS unit-economics.</p><p><strong>Key stock catalysts:</strong> First, the company&#8217;s rapid product release and innovation cadence are one of the best amongst SaaS companies with that it drives their TAM and provides additional revenue channels. Secondly, Datadog has strong relationships with the developer community. Hence, as a result, they are generally able to release products that their clients &#8220;want&#8221; and they have been successful in driving their dollar-based net retention rate which continues to drive acceleration in their revenues (NTM Growth is 41% at $1.41Billion). Gartner estimates that only 5% of applications are monitored as of 2020 meaning many more companies need this software. The total addressable market is over $53B. Lastly, <a href="https://twitter.com/masterly_in/status/1474501087164047361?s=20">&nbsp;this is the most recent datapoint in 2021</a> that shows the current market share and the opportunity/huge runway ahead for DDOG to take away marketshare from incumbents.</p><p><strong>My financial investment thesis</strong>:</p><p>The company has had a compounded revenue growth of &gt;70% YoY over the last 4-years. They are the most sales efficient amongst their competitors with a CAC Payback period of &lt;8x times. They&#8217;ve maintained consistent net-dollar retention of over 130%+ over the last 5-years. They are profitable with 11% EBITDA Margins and 15% FCF Margins while rapidly still accelerating growth. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F149050c8-3f8b-47e2-a91f-76e4e681fb46_859x240.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F149050c8-3f8b-47e2-a91f-76e4e681fb46_859x240.png" width="859" height="240" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/149050c8-3f8b-47e2-a91f-76e4e681fb46_859x240.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:240,&quot;width&quot;:859,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:34148,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F149050c8-3f8b-47e2-a91f-76e4e681fb46_859x240.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F149050c8-3f8b-47e2-a91f-76e4e681fb46_859x240.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F149050c8-3f8b-47e2-a91f-76e4e681fb46_859x240.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F149050c8-3f8b-47e2-a91f-76e4e681fb46_859x240.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h3><strong>SentinelOne</strong>:</h3><p>SentinelOne is an endpoint and workload management software cybersecurity company that protects devices and users from fraud. <strong>My investment thesis</strong> is that S1 is an emerging endpoint cybersecurity company that has a technically superior product to many of its peers as evidenced by world-leading firms. Global research firm, <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/lp/gartnermq/">Gartner ranks them as a Leader in endpoint protection</a>. MITRE Corporation (A leading non-partisan cybersecurity agency funded by the US Govt to rank security products) <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/lp/mitre/">ranked SentinelOne&#8217;s product as more superior relative to Crowdstrike</a> and 29 other endpoint detection vendors in threat detection, resolving issues, speed to reaction, and the provider with the most automated features. Secondly, SentinelOne is showing evidence of making their product more automated in detecting cybercrimes, responding faster, and finishing the job with less human intervention. Automation is a strong competitive advantage over its competitors due to the shortage of IT Cybersecurity professionals. This automation will drive long-term improvements in Gross and profit margins. This is all impressive for a relatively young company like S1.</p><p><strong>Key catalysts for the stock:</strong> On the financials, the company has been <strong>growing at triple-digit growth rates + accelerating </strong>its revenue on a quarterly basis while improving gross margins, losses &amp; FCF (Though still at a large number). S1 is drastically narrowing down its losses and based on the superior product, there is no reason not to expect future operating leverage as indicated with the architecture of S1&#8217;s product.  </p><p><strong>The financial metrics</strong> that drive my thesis are indicated below: </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F949ef5d8-d1cc-4a11-9e8d-65b1a05a7b98_850x281.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F949ef5d8-d1cc-4a11-9e8d-65b1a05a7b98_850x281.png" width="850" height="281" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/949ef5d8-d1cc-4a11-9e8d-65b1a05a7b98_850x281.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:281,&quot;width&quot;:850,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:41684,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F949ef5d8-d1cc-4a11-9e8d-65b1a05a7b98_850x281.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F949ef5d8-d1cc-4a11-9e8d-65b1a05a7b98_850x281.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F949ef5d8-d1cc-4a11-9e8d-65b1a05a7b98_850x281.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F949ef5d8-d1cc-4a11-9e8d-65b1a05a7b98_850x281.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Later next month, I will be writing a deep dive on SentinelOne prowess in cybersecurity.

There is a powerful network effect and rewarding incentive mechanism for both parties. Affirm has great technological capabilities for underwriting and facilitating payments. They have a reputable founder who has built phenomenal businesses in the past with high credibility.</p><p><strong>Key catalysts for the stock</strong>:  Stronger partnership integration with Amazon and Shopify during 2021 holiday sales should drive strong revenue, triple-digit merchant, and customer growth over the next upcoming quarters. They guided for 62% growth which didnt factor any of the following partnerships.  <strong>Key recent risks:</strong> Recently, there has been news circulating that from <a href="https://twitter.com/shivsharma_5/status/1475677475262791682?s=20">the news </a>was released that few people are not replaying their loans and there are many rumors about the chances of high-default rates. However, much of this information is selective info and they do not have a large sample to make their data points sufficient/valid. We need to wait for the next earnings to monitor the results. I am no longer planning to add to my position right now, but I continue to be focused on Affirm&#8217;s financial execution and my confidence in Max Levchin.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11b3a834-d972-422b-b64e-75580308a231_947x410.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11b3a834-d972-422b-b64e-75580308a231_947x410.png" width="947" height="410" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/11b3a834-d972-422b-b64e-75580308a231_947x410.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:410,&quot;width&quot;:947,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:48819,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11b3a834-d972-422b-b64e-75580308a231_947x410.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11b3a834-d972-422b-b64e-75580308a231_947x410.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11b3a834-d972-422b-b64e-75580308a231_947x410.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11b3a834-d972-422b-b64e-75580308a231_947x410.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>I have conducted multiple research and analysis into Affirm can be seen in the thread below. This is <strong><a href="https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/p/affirm-holdings-a-deep-dive-exploration">my Affirm Deep-dive - A Deep Dive Exploration into Affirm's Competitive Moats</a></strong>. Finally, this is <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/InvestiAnalyst/status/1475647208372400130?s=20">a compilation of my analysis and work on Affirm and the BNPL Ecosystem</a></strong>. </p><p></p><h3><strong>Confluent:</strong></h3><p>Confluent runs an Open-Source, data management and a messaging data platform called Apache Kafka that helps data teams manage the flow and direction of information in the enterprise. <strong>My investment thesis</strong> is built on the fact that CFLT is a highly sticky product with very high switching costs. Before a large enterprise decides to adopt CFLT, there is a high amt of foundational architectural analysis that goes into such decisions which generally means the sales cycle can be longer, but the outcome is a very high customer lifetime value. Confluent has a high mindshare and brand cognitive reference amongst the average developers which is a high competitive advantage over competitors. Apache Kafka has a large developer community which can make the product a bottom-up sales funnel (developer-centric) or top-down (CTO decision) which makes the GTM easy. Finally, though one weakness for CFLT is the fact that they are not top of the CTO budget list, my thesis is that as companies continue to experience a high amount of data, they would need CFLT. For more, read <a href="https://twitter.com/InvestiAnalyst/status/1457081842226532359?s=20">my full confluent thesis link</a>:</p><p><strong>Key Stock Catalysts: </strong>The key stock catalysts is the rapid acceleration and adoption of Confluent&#8217;s cloud product. CFLT beat last quarter&#8217;s earnings result by over 10% and raised guidance by 13%. The cloud business suggests that they are winning market share rapidly amongst open-source tools.</p><p>This is a good segway into their Financial execution. The Cloud execution is the primary thesis for CFLT long-term as it drives significant unit economics and is the key metric to watch. CFLT accelerated their cloud growth from 118% in 2020 to over 246% YoY Growth rate in 2021. CFLT accelerated top-line growth and all the metrics seen below.</p><p><strong>Key Financial Metrics:</strong></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f1de041-bbe5-488f-9811-2e7b3a9abf1c_848x301.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f1de041-bbe5-488f-9811-2e7b3a9abf1c_848x301.png" width="848" height="301" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3f1de041-bbe5-488f-9811-2e7b3a9abf1c_848x301.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:301,&quot;width&quot;:848,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:46028,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f1de041-bbe5-488f-9811-2e7b3a9abf1c_848x301.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f1de041-bbe5-488f-9811-2e7b3a9abf1c_848x301.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f1de041-bbe5-488f-9811-2e7b3a9abf1c_848x301.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f1de041-bbe5-488f-9811-2e7b3a9abf1c_848x301.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p></p><h3><strong>Zscaler:</strong></h3><p>ZS provides enterprise-wide, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D5mg9an19o&amp;ab_channel=CheckPointSoftwareTechnologies%2CLtd.">zero-trust</a>, and SASE (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opy9D-8eyVg&amp;ab_channel=TheCISOPerspective">Secure-Access Service Edge</a>) cybersecurity solutions for large corporations. Zero-trust security architecture is simply ensuring that users are required to log in/get permission to access any company&#8217;s application or systems. ZS&#8217;s product is built for companies that have distributed workforce scattered across the globe and/or employees that are working remotely from home that need to be secured on the cloud/or to a company&#8217;s network. <strong>My investment thesis</strong> is that enterprise security with cloud-native architecture is required amidst the growing cyber hacks. ZScaler has built a global network merch ZIA &amp; ZPA to allow a company to secure all their SaaS application. My thesis for paying for ZS&#8217;s high valuation is that they have a superior competitive advantage as one of the first-movers in ZTNA since they built an entire cloud-native zero-trust product. ZS&#8217;s product also has high switching costs, strong bird-eye view coverage of a company&#8217;s network. As remote work continues to be vital, Cloud computing grows and security continues to remain top of mind, ZScaler products will only continue to be in high demand.

As seen below, Palantir&#8217;s growth is beginning to slow most especially when compared to relative peers within the big data and analytics industry like SNOW. Secondly, if the company will not show signs of operating leverage (most especially reducing their high stock-based compensation) then revenue growth should be growing rapidly grow.

I will continue to monitor things.</p><h3><strong>AMD:</strong></h3><p>AMD is a key provider for chips and semiconductors for computer GPU data centers, PC CPU Markets, Cloud, Graphics, and Gaming consoles. Major secular tailwinds combined with a company that is leading in each market. I have over 30% position in AMD as I believe it will be impossible to lose money on such a critical player in the world&#8217;s digital transformation. Lisa Su is a phenomenal and underrated world-class leader and engineer. </p><p>Additionally, I believe that Meta&#8217;s (Facebook) recent announcement that they have chosen AMD as their partner for their Meta transformation is a big deal. Metaverse spending will grow significantly and highly benefit AMD. Secondly, there continues to be a significant demand for semiconductors going into 2022. The financial metrics are all the items I need on a company&#8217;s financial statements. Finally, as mentioned portfolio 2 is &#8216;only relatively conservative&#8217;, so I prefer to park my money into a decently large, no-brainer company with multiple catalysts.

They have one of the best moats in consumer tech in that they have a high network effect and high brand presence/mindshare within the Freelance economy globally. <strong>My key catalysts thesis</strong> revolves solely on the fact that they are penetrating the enterprise with aggressive new product launches and strong Go-to-Market sales motion for &#8216;land and expand&#8217; within the enterprise. They are currently ramping up their sales executives. They&#8217;ve launched new enterprise features that should drive better growth in 2022. We are already seeing this happen with the acceleration of their enterprise growth moving from 96% to 100% to 107% over the last three quarters. Lastly, the last two employment reports suggest that self-employment has grown, so I&#8217;m hoping Upwork captures some of this boom. </p><p><strong>Key Fundamental metrics</strong>: Enterprise growth will continue to drive revenue growth. We have already seen some execution as they have been accelerating their enterprise clients as outlined earlier.  They have been experiencing revenue growth acceleration and a modest deceleration in the past quarter. I continue to remain optimistic about Upwork&#8217;s future growth trajectory. I' will be monitoring the following metrics next quarter.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe440d894-e317-43cb-847a-ba7d1b4919e8_964x196.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe440d894-e317-43cb-847a-ba7d1b4919e8_964x196.png" width="964" height="196" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e440d894-e317-43cb-847a-ba7d1b4919e8_964x196.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:196,&quot;width&quot;:964,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:35261,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe440d894-e317-43cb-847a-ba7d1b4919e8_964x196.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe440d894-e317-43cb-847a-ba7d1b4919e8_964x196.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe440d894-e317-43cb-847a-ba7d1b4919e8_964x196.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe440d894-e317-43cb-847a-ba7d1b4919e8_964x196.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h3><strong>Silvergate Exchange:</strong></h3><p>Silvergate exchange is a financial infrastructure bank for banking and they provide critical solutions for digital currencies.

This is also part of project Diem which is Facebook&#8217;s goal of creating a new digital currency. The differentiator between Diem and popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) is that Diem is <strong>backed by government currency</strong>. Long-term, Diem is meant to stabilize the new offering and ensure secure global transactions. This is a high-quality way to play my long-term bull case for Cryptocurrencies.</p><p><strong>Key catalyst for the stock/growth</strong> will continue to be digital currency growth, the bank&#8217;s multiple levers for growth, (interest, non-interest income, as well as securities sales) and continued earnings growth.</p><p><strong>The key financial metrics: </strong>can all be found below.

The firm is similar to well-known consulting firms like Accenture, Deloitte, or lesser-known, but incredibly successful digital firms like Globant (GLOB) and/or EPAM systems.</p><p>Grid Dynamics&#8217; competitive advantage is that the firm is focused/has expertise on Cloud and Data AI/ML with an extensive network of engineering talent. They serve Enterprise software companies. They boast of top clients such as Apple, Google. The critical role that GDYN plays is to support many of the cloud companies we own/know in their digital transformation efforts. Forrester ranks them as one of the leaders in software development service providers. Recently, they were announced as <a href="https://ir.griddynamics.com/press-releases/details/pr-6-1-2022">AWS Advanced Consulting Partner</a> and earlier in November named a <a href="https://ir.griddynamics.com/press-releases/details/pr-12-21-2021">Google Cloud Expertise premier partner</a>. They play a key role as move to the Cloud.</p><p><strong>Key catalysts for growth</strong>: I expect continuous QoQ accelerating growth over the next two quarters as a result of new contracts and logo signed last quarter (Customer growth is growing around 42% year-over-year). There has been a high number of institutional ownership in the company (over 236%) i.e. over a 100% growth compared to last year.</p><p><strong>Key Financial metrics</strong>: Observe there has been a revenue top-line growth acceleration. Recent revenue was $58 million in the third quarter of 2021 which was up 22% on a sequential basis and 120% on a year-over-year basis. The core organic growth was 67% year-over-year. Overall, this is a trial position as it is relatively small. However, as the cloud, AI/ML, and Enterprise tech continue to grow rapidly, I expect GDYN to ride that secular enterprise Cloud and Data momentum.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8a46a8c-91a1-48c6-8ded-7cb9a1fcbdb0_753x203.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8a46a8c-91a1-48c6-8ded-7cb9a1fcbdb0_753x203.png" width="753" height="203" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b8a46a8c-91a1-48c6-8ded-7cb9a1fcbdb0_753x203.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:203,&quot;width&quot;:753,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:26012,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8a46a8c-91a1-48c6-8ded-7cb9a1fcbdb0_753x203.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8a46a8c-91a1-48c6-8ded-7cb9a1fcbdb0_753x203.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8a46a8c-91a1-48c6-8ded-7cb9a1fcbdb0_753x203.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8a46a8c-91a1-48c6-8ded-7cb9a1fcbdb0_753x203.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h3><strong>Fortinet:</strong></h3><p>Fortinet is a leader in cybersecurity solutions to a wide variety of organizations, including enterprises, security service providers, and small businesses. My investment thesis is built on the foundation that Zero-trust and networking-based Cybersecurity is going to be one of the biggest challenges faced by modern enterprises. I started a position Fortinet because of their leadership in <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en_ca/solutions/enterprise-networks/sd-wan/what-is-sd-wan.html">networking architecture (SD-WAN)</a> security solutions. Due to Fortinet's long experience in hardware, they&#8217;ve built a core strength in networking than many peers and have a strong competitive advantage in software-defined networking (the new way that Apps are being built today on VM&#8217;s) and Zero-trust. Gartner ranks them as a leader in WAN Edge solutions. Gartner believes that <strong>50% of orgs will have a SASE strategy by 2025</strong> (vs 5% in 2020). They also predicted that <strong>SASE + SD-WAN initiatives will be adopted by 60% of orgs</strong> (vs 10% in 2020), see <a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-25UP7DNU%26ct=210423&amp;amp;st=sb">full Gartner report</a>. &nbsp;FTNT is well-positioned than many companies.

In the meantime, feel free to read about an amazing investor I learned about during 2021 -&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/InvestiAnalyst/status/1476618245033496589">Saul&#8217;s Investing</a>. </p><p>I also spent sometime reading about Yen Liow, a growth equity SMID fund manager of Aravrt Global in New York. I enjoyed reading about his philosophy of growth investing by hunting for horses and <strong>exploiting volatility. </strong>This is a doc that <a href="https://investmenttalk.substack.com/p/learning-from-yen-liow-game-within?r=414hy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">outlines his methodology</a>.  This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeqRmoAtIpc&amp;t=2364s&amp;ab_channel=YenLiow">video Interview</a> delves into the different edges of investing and the importance of truthful self-awareness for Investors. </p><p>*****</p><h4><strong>Mental Decision-making/Process lessons in the month:</strong></h4><p>Every month I share an area that I struggled with as an investor. During the volatility of December, I was challenged to re-evaluate my convictions. It made me realize the importance of doing your own deep due diligence and if you don&#8217;t, bear markets expose an individual. You cannot borrow conviction. The market is an expensive place to learn such a mistake. </p><p>Secondly, I learned  I need to further refine my process volatility. When the market goes lower, many things become cheap and I&#8217;ve found it difficult to assess equally-weighted apple v oranges.  This will be important this year where we face multiple rate hikes.  </p><p>*****</p><h4>Looking forward - Next Edition:</h4><h5>Future Portfolio Review:</h5><p>In next month&#8217;s portfolio review editions, I&#8217;ll go deeper on Crowdstrike, AI vision semiconductor-Ambarella, and EM Fintech player, D-Local. </p><p>Confluent, Upwork and watchlist candidate, Cloudflare report earnings on February 10, so my next portfolio review will come out the weekend of Feb 13 where I&#8217;ll provide an in-depth earnings analysis and finally, going forward, you can expect, I will go deeper into each of these companies as well as my sell decisions. This was my first review and I didn&#8217;t want to make this review extensively long.</p><h4><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h4><p>This is a reflection exercise each month to help refine my investing process.

Today, we will be exploring Affirm and discussing their competitive advantage and the durability of their moat. Below is an overview:</p><ol><li><p>Basic Overview</p></li><li><p>BNPL Success Criteria</p></li><li><p>10-Competitive Advantages &amp; Moat: Why Affirm Wins.</p></li><li><p>Industry Overview, Catalysts, Key Players</p></li><li><p>Financial Analysis</p></li><li><p>Future Growth Opportunities</p></li><li><p>Bear Case: Thesis Risks</p></li><li><p>Summary.</p></li></ol><h3><strong>Summary - Investment Thesis:</strong></h3><p>Buy-Now-Pay-Later has the opportunity to disrupt the trillion-dollar Credit Card payments industry. BNPL is a unique business model that evolved after the financial crisis and offers a key value proposition to both the merchants and consumers since the likes of Visa and Mastercard created a similar model. The BNPL Market is going to be hard to have a winner take all, ultimately, my thesis is built upon the fact that I believe this market will be big enough to allow the Top 3 players to win. </p><p>This deep dive will exclusively explore Affirm&#8217;s Competitive moats and industry advantages within this emerging industry since this is the biggest area of controversy amongst Investors. I&#8217;ll discuss BNPL's success criteria and Affirm&#8217;s opportunity to utilize their competitive strengths to win this market.</p><h4><em><strong>Case-Study: How the Expensive Apple iPhones &amp; Android Became Widely Accessible:</strong></em></h4><p>Affirm&#8217;s BNPL Competitive Moat is powerful when we consider how expensive Apple iPhones and Samsung devices became widely successful for purchase.&nbsp; The reason these expensive devices became widely accessible was primarily due to the adjustment of the payment deals, structure, and convenience. &nbsp;A consumer could easily buy a $1500 phone with simple a 0% APR and pay over time. If this business model was never re-invented, Apple would not make more revenues. However, ever since this change. Consumers got their desired phone and flexibility around how they paid. We saw tremendous growth for iPhones. In essence, BNPL is expanding this model globally to a broad range of expensive products. For example, we saw how Peloton became successful in the pandemic. Now replicate this model across a broad range of products on Amazon or other large retailers.</p><p><strong>My Original Thread:</strong></p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/InvestiAnalyst/status/1446976793605390336?s=20&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;This is a comprehensive thread on the Buy-Now-Pay-Later Trend. \n\nWhy have the World's Largest Retailers chosen Affirm's BNPL solution instead of building their solution in-house?\n\nThis thread explores $AFRM's Competitive Advantage and the current Credit Card disruption: &quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;InvestiAnalyst&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Francis - Analyst&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Sat Oct 09 23:12:05 +0000 2021&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[{&quot;img_url&quot;:&quot;https://pbs.substack.com/media/FBSxudQVEAI6tvm.jpg&quot;,&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;https://t.co/vk24ai3Gfd&quot;,&quot;alt_text&quot;:null}],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:191,&quot;like_count&quot;:745,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null}"><a href="https://twitter.com/InvestiAnalyst/status/1446976793605390336?s=20" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-user-avatar" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/twitter_name/w_36/InvestiAnalyst.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @InvestiAnalyst"><span class="tweet-author-name">Francis - Analyst </span><span class="tweet-author">@InvestiAnalyst</span></div>This is a comprehensive thread on the Buy-Now-Pay-Later Trend.

This is the model that Visa used to build a powerful moat that has lasted for ages.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F077fd8ea-1493-4b46-9347-8caa206b048e_417x373.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F077fd8ea-1493-4b46-9347-8caa206b048e_417x373.png" width="297" height="265.66187050359713" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/077fd8ea-1493-4b46-9347-8caa206b048e_417x373.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:373,&quot;width&quot;:417,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:297,&quot;bytes&quot;:40337,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F077fd8ea-1493-4b46-9347-8caa206b048e_417x373.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F077fd8ea-1493-4b46-9347-8caa206b048e_417x373.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F077fd8ea-1493-4b46-9347-8caa206b048e_417x373.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F077fd8ea-1493-4b46-9347-8caa206b048e_417x373.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Affirm ultimately aggregates the supply of a merchant&#8217;s products (selling items fast) and aligns it to the demand for consumers (with discounted products) creating a self-reinforcing cycle and benefit for both parties that allow Affirm to gain wide utility fast and becomes sticky for both parties.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa52d734c-bfdc-4fc6-81b8-2bb147e4e394_488x373.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa52d734c-bfdc-4fc6-81b8-2bb147e4e394_488x373.png" width="400" height="305.73770491803276" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a52d734c-bfdc-4fc6-81b8-2bb147e4e394_488x373.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:373,&quot;width&quot;:488,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:400,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Image&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Image" title="Image" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa52d734c-bfdc-4fc6-81b8-2bb147e4e394_488x373.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa52d734c-bfdc-4fc6-81b8-2bb147e4e394_488x373.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa52d734c-bfdc-4fc6-81b8-2bb147e4e394_488x373.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa52d734c-bfdc-4fc6-81b8-2bb147e4e394_488x373.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Fundamental to Affirms moat is their business model of a two-sided network that has a powerful network effect that adds incremental value to both customers (B2C) and the merchants (B2B). For every transaction on both side of the network, Affirm' significantly improves their internal AI/ML risk models, brand, payment engine and a significant amount of data.</p><p>Let&#8217;s evaluate the benefits for both parties that make this moat strong:</p><p><strong>Merchants:</strong></p><p>Merchants care about: Sales, Average cart order value, Repeat Customers, Upselling at Checkout.&nbsp; Affirms offers the following for merchant:</p><ul><li><p>They are a key enabler of increasing sales by making product payments more affordable and convenient based on the time value which increases sales conversion and more upselling at checkout. Eg. Apple loves its partnership deals with mobile carriers because they sell when consumers prices are affordable. </p></li><li><p>This leads consumers to be able to afford Higher Average Order Value items, reduce abandon rates at the cart and increase their purchasing power based on their <strong>ability to repay.</strong></p></li><li><p>They help drive the number of repeat and habitual consumers to a merchant.</p></li><li><p>They provide Lead Generation, Marketing, and driving Traffic for the Merchant brand through understanding consumer behavior on their Affirm App.</p></li><li><p>They provide merchants with advanced customer data &amp; insights for their store, products, and consumers.</p></li><li><p>Convenience: Merchants want a BNPL that is used by other consumers that shop at different big stores. A big merchant like Amazon doesn&#8217;t want to have multiple BNPL at checkout, so they would rather have only one main provider.</p></li><li><p>Merchants payment: Affirm pays the merchants the cash for the item purchased immediately. They save merchants time and effort by taking care of any consumer inquires, experience, and the entire pre/post-purchase customer experience (with the acquisition of Returnly).</p></li></ul><p>Based on all the following listed above, merchants are happy to pay a 5-6% merchant discount rate (where they pay Affirm back for every purchase sold) because the BNPL model contributes a significant amount of ROI &amp; Bottom line to the business. </p><p>As a result, Affirm has maintained an impressive dollar-based net retention of &gt;100%+ over the last four years while retaining a significant cohort of merchants. This proves that Affirm&#8217;s BNPL has a good form of stickiness amongst Merchants. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b2ddecf-2531-4ed8-973e-0429f5e0eabb_349x272.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b2ddecf-2531-4ed8-973e-0429f5e0eabb_349x272.png" width="349" height="272" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9b2ddecf-2531-4ed8-973e-0429f5e0eabb_349x272.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:272,&quot;width&quot;:349,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Image&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Image" title="Image" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b2ddecf-2531-4ed8-973e-0429f5e0eabb_349x272.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b2ddecf-2531-4ed8-973e-0429f5e0eabb_349x272.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b2ddecf-2531-4ed8-973e-0429f5e0eabb_349x272.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b2ddecf-2531-4ed8-973e-0429f5e0eabb_349x272.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><strong>Value Proposition to Consumers:</strong></p><ul><li><p>The consumer gets convenience, purchasing power, and the product at their terms. </p></li><li><p>Consumers get better payment deals structured around how they prefer to best pay overtime.</p></li><li><p>Consumers can shop and discover discounted products and better prices from a wide variety of merchants</p></li><li><p>Customer experiences and delight: Most consumers would prefer to have only 1 or perhaps 2 maximum providers for their BNPL services when they go shopping.

Importantly, currently, today when a consumer makes a transaction on Visa or Mastercard, these big credit card companies cannot see the <strong>actual</strong> <strong>item</strong> <strong>purchased</strong>, they only know a transaction or payment has gone their system since they are protocol companies. (Remember the last you returned something at Walmart, the reason you always need a paper receipt is that Visa or Mastercard&#8217;s old infrastructure don&#8217;t allow them to see full details of any transaction done at a store like Walmart. If their infrastructure allowed them, consumers won&#8217;t need paper receipts. This could all be digitally added to your credit card bill.). For more details, highly recommend listening to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/49mpqwqpqxA28lfeSTQ05R">this deep-dive on Visa&#8217;s business</a>.</p><p>However, BNPL and Affirm&#8217;s infrastructure allows them to see a high-level description of the item a consumer purchased because their infrastructure allows them to access the data. As 16oz Partner, Alex Rampell calls it: &#8220;<em>It&#8217;s a **parallel** network, with SKU-level information, that bypasses the issuing bank, card network, and merchant acquirer. It&#8217;s just the consumer, the merchant, and a new participant: the product manufacturer!&#8221;</em></p><p>This SKU level <strong>unlocks numerous use-cases and opportunities</strong> for BNPL Providers. For example, Apple could minimize or bypass using a network carrier to subsidize iPhones or Apple Devices. (hint: this is how Apple Canada is unlocking their Affirm Partnership in Canada.)  <strong>MA/V and PayPal&#8217;s infrastructure cannot easily access this SKU level as efficiently as does direct BNPL suppliers do</strong>. </p><p>Another benefit is that Affirm sees a substantial part of what a merchant sold. They get to really understand the timing of cash flow and expenses of both parties which allows them to capitalize and use those data points to build all types of products. An example is the targeted ads they provide for merchants or most recently, Affirm announced a merchant capital program where they plan to loan businesses cash similar to a bank or Square primarily because they see/know the merchants cash-flow and they can underwrite risk appropriately.</p><p>Another high-potential benefit of this SKU data is that Affirm can work exclusively with a merchant to curate and build a financial package that excludes the banks, or the credit card companies. For example, Walmart can create their own Walmart Store card with Affirm. Walmart incentivizes the consumer to use those cards to make store/online purchases on which everything is built on an Affirm network (This is currently rolling out across 3900 Walmart Stores. I already got an offer here in Canada). Another method that benefits the BNPL method is that BNPL SKU data can allow a retailer like Walmart or Target to create &#8220;Item specific&#8221; coupons on products they need to sell quickly. However, with the legacy companies like Visa or any institution, their infrastructure cannot allow them easily match an SKU coupon on a product and enable BNPL on that item as easily. </p><p>If you combine the list of advantages above for merchants with a unique SKU parallel network that allows Affirm to leverage partnerships directly with Product manufacturers. This creates a powerful value proposition and barrier to entry for legacy players. This is the reason why Klarna and Afterpay have been growing rapidly in Europe and APAC. Affirm will be using this strategy with Amazon and Walmart over the coming year. </p><p><strong>SKU &amp; Platform allows Significant Data Advantages:</strong></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7540e509-74d5-49d6-83b1-3f1c95c405c9_2000x1290.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7540e509-74d5-49d6-83b1-3f1c95c405c9_2000x1290.jpeg" width="446" height="287.63324175824175" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7540e509-74d5-49d6-83b1-3f1c95c405c9_2000x1290.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:939,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:446,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;What Makes Data Valuable: The Truth About Data Network Effects&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="What Makes Data Valuable: The Truth About Data Network Effects" title="What Makes Data Valuable: The Truth About Data Network Effects" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7540e509-74d5-49d6-83b1-3f1c95c405c9_2000x1290.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7540e509-74d5-49d6-83b1-3f1c95c405c9_2000x1290.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7540e509-74d5-49d6-83b1-3f1c95c405c9_2000x1290.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7540e509-74d5-49d6-83b1-3f1c95c405c9_2000x1290.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Generally, data network effect can be powerful when a company can gain a competitive advantage by accessing user data more effectively, at a cheaper rate, and personalizing or creating valuable products that address a business need.  &#8220;In a product with a data moat, there is a &#8220;central repository&#8221; of data, as said by Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s Alex Rampell. The more people keep adding to this repository, the more useful it becomes.</p><p>Affirm accesses billions worth of data both from the consumer and merchants (Currently almost $13-billion worth of GMV transactions) that occurred over Affirm&#8217;s network. This number should double with the Amazon partnership. The value again of SKU data is that Affirm <strong>has access to see the actual name and dollar-value of the transactions </strong>on all items. There will be a <strong>tremendous amount of data gained from Amazon and Walmart datasets. </strong></p><p>Hence, Affirm can build better algorithms due to more data to create better future personalized products that consumers want. For example, We are seeing Affirm build consumer products such as the Debit+ for payments, Rewards &amp; cash-back,  Cryptocurrencies, and the super-app. For merchants, they are creating products such as brand-sponsored solutions, merchant capital-access programs, adaptive checkout, and more. Every one of these products creates data<strong> </strong>which makes staying in Affirm&#8217;s data ecosystem and repository more valuable for them, increases the cost of switching, allows a large volume of data to flow, and keeps both sides of the network&#8217;s attention within the platform.</p><p>In summary, Affirm is using three measures to aggregate merchants and consumers.</p><ol><li><p>aggregating suppliers and customers through partnerships with the largest eCommerce players</p></li><li><p>collecting valuable data and efficiently amass valuable data</p></li><li><p>building a product ecosystem &#8212;</p></li></ol><p>Over time, it will be important for their drive down customer acquisition costs and increase engagement on their app to make this moat even stronger.</p><h3><strong>3- North American First Mover Advantage and a decade long experience:</strong></h3><p>Affirm was arguably the first mover into the Buy-Now-Pay-Later space within North America. Affirm had been the leading BNPL name in the US, owing as much as over 80% market share based on mobile payment solutions downloads. The market share declined later into 2018 as more BNPL joined the market.</p><p>The benefit of this first-mover advantage is that they have accrued significant amounts of data, information, and insights on the North American consumer which gives them a higher advantage towards improving their AI/Machine learning products, Risk, and payment models. <em>&nbsp;</em>Max Levchin has utilized this advantage that he has obtained through the understanding of consumer behavior and risk management to build the company&#8217;s competitive strength in underwriting risks and driving sales. A first-mover advantage combined with a 10-year head-start on the North American consumer has allowed Affirm to underwrite and evaluate consumer financing patterns especially during both bull markets and bad economic moments. This is a data point that limits competitors from easily just building their BNPL solution. Better yet, if competitors only started building their solutions in 2020 or 2021, Affirm has a significant headstart that by the time competitors become fully comfortable in developing their BNPL solutions, Affirm would have gotten even much better.</p><p>The reason this is an advantage is that a BNPL needs &#8220;time* to understand how effective consumers payback or to improve their ability to underwrite risks and efficiently access capital markets to fund those loans <strong>at the right time and at a large scale, in recessions and bull market.</strong> The best description is similar to a Credit Score. A consumer needs time and transactions over a long duration to establish great credit. Yes, any competitor can build a BNPL service, however, since BNPL is based on Debit-level data which is the timing of cash flow (as compared to credit cards), it takes time to see how transactions flow to build an effective underwriting risk model <strong>that can significantly scale.</strong> This is one of Affirm&#8217;s competitive advantages &#8211; the time and decade-long reps they have built cannot be replicated overnight by a competitor. Affirm has effectively built a brand, data infrastructure, and goodwill over a long duration and the data advantage from being a first mover is a value-add when trying to acquire merchants.</p><h3>4- Higher Sales Conversion build Payment Checkout Competency:</h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc465ea7b-4d27-41ad-b36b-308683013787_456x367.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc465ea7b-4d27-41ad-b36b-308683013787_456x367.png" width="326" height="262.37280701754383" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c465ea7b-4d27-41ad-b36b-308683013787_456x367.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:367,&quot;width&quot;:456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:326,&quot;bytes&quot;:185405,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc465ea7b-4d27-41ad-b36b-308683013787_456x367.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc465ea7b-4d27-41ad-b36b-308683013787_456x367.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc465ea7b-4d27-41ad-b36b-308683013787_456x367.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc465ea7b-4d27-41ad-b36b-308683013787_456x367.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>A merchant&#8217;s dream is to have almost every consumer use their checkout solution on all products. Affirm has arguably built a special payment competency than many of their peers. &nbsp;Affirm&#8217;s ability to increase AoV&#8217;s and drive sales conversion is priceless to merchants than any <strong>other form of payment method</strong>. Many of these strengths emanate from the earlier points discussed about the data leverage Affirm gets from their first advantage and data advantages. Affirm sees and understands the consumer behavior at the checkout based on the past item purchased. Affirm effectively uses superior consumer behavior/purchase patterns to offer personalized payment packages or installment types for consumers.</p><p>Few metrics: Affirm&#8217;s solution was evaluated by Shopify discovered that Affirm&#8217;s solution allowed 1 in 4 Shopify merchants in early access to see a 50% increase in Average Order Value (AoV)/Items purchased compared to other payment providers. Merchants saw 28% less cart abandonment and 30% improvements in speed than other providers.</p><p>Recently, Affirm has further built on this advantage by launching a new product called &#8220;Adaptive Cart Checkout.&#8221; A feature that personalizes payment schedules based on items and users. This is a solution for merchants that has already seen over 26% increase in cart conversion, 22% consumer lift in approvals, and a 20% increase in sales for early merchants that have tried out the solution. In their recent earnings call in November they mentioned<em>, &#8220;Adaptive checkout, the reinvention of our core business, is fully live in the market, has delivered an over 25% conversion lift, and has already been adopted by 44% of eligible merchants.&#8221;</em></p><p>This higher sales conversion happened when the merchant switched from a third-party provider to buy now, pay later solutions by Affirm.&nbsp; The advantage of being able to <strong>convert sales that would otherwise be abandoned </strong>is particularly pertinent to merchants. More companies are realizing that they can allocate their marketing budgets to payment providers like Affirm due to BNPL's ability to drive sales and incremental leads. Affirm has additional payment data points which they likely cannot share with the public due to competitors, but it is clear that Affirm payment solution metrics are key reasons Merchants such as Amazon and Shopify continue to choose them.</p><h3><strong>5- Affirm&#8217;s Brand and Name Recognition in North America</strong></h3><p>A brand is an essential element to any successful company and Affirm commands one of the highest <strong>within the Financial</strong> and Technology industry, <strong>a respectable score of 78.</strong></p><p>The context to understanding Affirm&#8217;s brand is that Affirm controls a large aspect of the distribution of a merchant&#8217;s product and plays a key role in the customer journey. They play a key role in the front-end (branding) when a consumer wants to pay, and they are the back-end payments technology infrastructure for a company. This is essentially a competitive moat for a 2-sided network.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5fbf55c-2e40-4a2f-bfc9-ce4ec9b218a6_833x412.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5fbf55c-2e40-4a2f-bfc9-ce4ec9b218a6_833x412.png" width="676" height="334.3481392557023" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c5fbf55c-2e40-4a2f-bfc9-ce4ec9b218a6_833x412.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:412,&quot;width&quot;:833,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:676,&quot;bytes&quot;:74829,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5fbf55c-2e40-4a2f-bfc9-ce4ec9b218a6_833x412.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5fbf55c-2e40-4a2f-bfc9-ce4ec9b218a6_833x412.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5fbf55c-2e40-4a2f-bfc9-ce4ec9b218a6_833x412.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5fbf55c-2e40-4a2f-bfc9-ce4ec9b218a6_833x412.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>There are few reasons this brand is important.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s understand it. The consumer likely starts their journey by going into the Affirm App (or they encounter Affirm when they arrive at the product checkout &#8211; this will be more prominent with the Amazon&#8217;s website), secondly, if necessary, Affirm underwrites the customer&#8217;s credit depending on purchase and overtime, the consumer repays their loan to Affirm. If product issues arise or payment inquiries arise that require customer service, the consumer generally has to speak to Affirm. This happens across numerous merchants since these SMB businesses always post Affirm&#8217;s logo on their website and email campaigns to attract consumers. As a result, Affirm gets a large amount of mind-share and name recognition throughout a single purchase. Throughout this entire process, many companies&#8217; brand&#8217;s positivity reduces throughout the value-chain but a 78 is highly commendable despite all the roles that Affirm plays for over 100K merchants or over 8-million consumers. They must be doing something right.</p><p>Second, another context to the importance of Brand. Consumer Cognitive Coherent is term phrased by Dennis Hong which describes how consumers naturally think of a company&#8217;s brand or use it as a metaphor without realizing it. The best examples are Uber in transports, Airbnb in homes and DocuSign owns in eSignature, etc. &nbsp;Affirm is arguably the leading name in North America among young consumers.</p><p>Third, the millennial connection: Affirm has a strong audience primarily amongst millennials and Gen-Z. Affirm charges almost 0% on almost all their products, not everything, but they are one of the most cost-effective BNPL products for consumers than their Klarna and Afterpay competitors. They have a massive opportunity within this audience. This is an area that Amazon lacks any strong connection.</p><p>Finally, Affirm&#8217;s brand and high NPS <strong>is particularly rare in Fintech or Financial Services.</strong> This is an underrated moat and a bargaining power for Affirm when it creates deals and contracts with Merchants. The reason is that Affirm high NPS suggests that consumers trust Affirm with <strong>managing their finances</strong>. This is an important competitive strength for Affirm as it seeks to <strong>launch new financial products (or become a NeoBank) in the nearest future</strong>, like the Debit+ and more financial offerings. At their investor conference, the management team explained that Affirm&#8217;s brand has grown exponentially amongst their consumers in 2020 at a rate of over 70% YoY in Brand <s>A</s>wareness as at 2021. As Affirm will be the only BNPL payment provider on every Amazon checkout for the next two years, this brand power and awareness will further grow substantially amongst over 100-million consumers. This level of mindshare and moat will differentiate and drive long-term value for them.</p><h3><strong>6- Affirm&#8217;s Vertically-Integrated Data Infrastructure [Consumer UX to Payments Infrastructure]:</strong></h3><p>Affirm has a vertically Integrated technology stack for BNPL. Competitors like Mastercard and Visa have built their BNPL services around a white-labeled solution. Affirm owns and controls the entire customer/merchant journey starting from front-end Consumer UX all the way to the underlying payment software infrastructure. <strong>Few businesses have such a competitive advantage and level of access across both layers of a merchant&#8217;s business.</strong> &nbsp;</p><p>Affirm has a consumer-facing application and many aspects of branding as discussed, they are involved when the consumers receives the product and they provide the software for a merchant to process payments and they now have a Debit+ card that enables consumers to make purchases directly through the Affirm network. Additionally, they process a &nbsp;tremendous amount of data and information for the consumer, which allows them to provide their merchants with the key insights to help improve their financial bottom line.</p><p>They don&#8217;t rely on any third-party in the process of offering a service to either their consumers or merchants beyond financing.  Everything from 0 -&gt; 1 is controlled by Affirm due to their first-mover advantage. It&#8217;s important for Investors to understand that Affirm aims to differentiate itself by becoming a technology and data-focused Buy-Now-Pay-Later offering transparent financial products as defined by CEO, Max Levchin at a recent conference when asked:<em> &#8220;Affirm is a software-defined, data-preserving, vertically integrated network.&#8221;</em></p><p>In their Investor S1, Affirm&#8217;s largest expenses are primarily within their Data and Analytics segment rather than the usual Sales &amp; Marketing that makes up many high-tech companies. This builds on confidence that Affirm is using technology behind our understanding to enhance their product advantage. The cost of vertical integration is the short-term cost required for significant long-term value creation. Finally, it is crucial that Investors understand that <strong>technology expertise</strong>, <strong>data moat</strong>, and <strong>merchant lock-ins</strong> are going to be key differentiators of winners within BNPL as this model becomes ubiquitous.</p><h3>7- Delinquency, Underwriting, and Risk-Modelling across Higher and Lower AoV transactions:</h3><p>Risk and underwriting are some of the most essential components of the BNPL business model and unit economics. Affirm is <strong>currently the leader within the Higher-value, High-transactions volume</strong> of the BNPL Industry. They can better help merchants underwrite on transactions that require significant capital than their peers primarily because they were the <strong>first to move</strong> into this High AoV space. Eg. They helped Peloton be a successful and rapidly growing business. Going forward, it can be seen that Affirm&#8217;s AoV is declining with recent deals with Shopfiy and smaller merchants.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6aa5d2c5-1f60-4573-bb7f-ceb37465d193_506x94.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6aa5d2c5-1f60-4573-bb7f-ceb37465d193_506x94.png" width="506" height="94" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6aa5d2c5-1f60-4573-bb7f-ceb37465d193_506x94.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:94,&quot;width&quot;:506,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5775,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6aa5d2c5-1f60-4573-bb7f-ceb37465d193_506x94.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6aa5d2c5-1f60-4573-bb7f-ceb37465d193_506x94.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6aa5d2c5-1f60-4573-bb7f-ceb37465d193_506x94.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6aa5d2c5-1f60-4573-bb7f-ceb37465d193_506x94.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Categorically, Affirm is going to be the leading underwriting player on both High and Low AoV transactions especially as more Shopify and Amazon merchants come on board.

Affirm&#8217;s AI risk models are built on over 1Billion+ unique data points and 200+ consumer data variable inputs for fraud detection based on 7-millions loan transactions all of which have been executed over the past 10-years. They&#8217;ve underwritten good and bad customers for over a 10-year period &#8211; allowing for massive data advantages. Consumer delinquencies of loans &gt; 30 days+ have stayed at around 2.5% over the past two years.&nbsp; Affirm has shown that they have the best model for underwriting Higher AoV transactions than their BNPL peers which is a key reason why the big merchants are moving to Affirm. Another critical benefit of this competitive advantage is that Affirm has been able to efficiently sell loans to capital markets at good rates, access cheap funding which has allowed them to reinvest more money into the business without having to take on much more capital risk on their books.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb5bca2a-57c1-4ccb-b5fa-5603c1a4c647_374x284.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb5bca2a-57c1-4ccb-b5fa-5603c1a4c647_374x284.png" width="374" height="284" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fb5bca2a-57c1-4ccb-b5fa-5603c1a4c647_374x284.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:284,&quot;width&quot;:374,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Image&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Image" title="Image" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb5bca2a-57c1-4ccb-b5fa-5603c1a4c647_374x284.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb5bca2a-57c1-4ccb-b5fa-5603c1a4c647_374x284.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb5bca2a-57c1-4ccb-b5fa-5603c1a4c647_374x284.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb5bca2a-57c1-4ccb-b5fa-5603c1a4c647_374x284.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><strong>Merchants desire an efficient risk model for consumer approvals: </strong>Affirm&#8217;s models have proven to have lower loss ratios while allowing higher rates of credit acceptance than many other lenders.

Those 16 financial partners have been built over the past decade. It requires significant experience and not many competitors can easily tap those funds at scale to fund and manage their books especially when dealing with a client like Amazon. Over the years, Affirm has shown they can efficiently and effectively manage liquidity challenges. This is a great line from a generalist report I read,</p><p><em>&#8220;Affirm only funded 5% of platform GMV with equity and had $7-billion in third-party funding capacity. This is important because it enables Affirm to invest costly equity capital elsewhere and is a critical piece of Affirm's growth story. If Affirm can't find enough third-party capital, the business can't grow. The expectation is that the business will become more capital efficient over time. Cost of capital and equity requirements will decline with scale and invested funds will be recycled more often as Affirm introduces new high-frequency products.&#8221;</em></p><p>A large part of Affirm&#8217;s success has been their ease of accessing, funding, and managing the flow of funds. This leverage and easy access to capital have been possible due to the success of their lending models and the efficiency discussed above. They have around &lt;5% equity capital required and &gt;90% advance rate. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93d0826f-8052-4e46-a893-7a2dcab82672_863x383.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93d0826f-8052-4e46-a893-7a2dcab82672_863x383.png" width="616" height="273.38122827346467" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/93d0826f-8052-4e46-a893-7a2dcab82672_863x383.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:383,&quot;width&quot;:863,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:616,&quot;bytes&quot;:73813,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93d0826f-8052-4e46-a893-7a2dcab82672_863x383.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93d0826f-8052-4e46-a893-7a2dcab82672_863x383.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93d0826f-8052-4e46-a893-7a2dcab82672_863x383.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93d0826f-8052-4e46-a893-7a2dcab82672_863x383.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Affirm has created a unique mix of funding means and different banking that if a liquidity crunch or a major bear market hit the financial markets, they would still be able to access capital to fund their loans.

Affirm will be seen/used by over hundreds of millions for the next 600-days is immense. </p><p>The recent marque partnerships with these dominant retail Commerce platforms should provide access to millions of US consumers and merchants and across the world globally. This will create significant mindshare amongst US Commerce and wide brand recognition which will lower Affirm&#8217;s CAC to LTV over the long run.

Many of these partnerships go last longer for the next decade.</p><p>Going forward, this moat will increase Affirm&#8217;s bargaining power and ease of acquiring other large enterprise merchants because of the network effects that run across the industry and ease of integrating customers&#8217; data across platforms since those platforms reach over 300+ million consumers.</p><p>Based on these partnerships with the largest 4 Commerce names in the US and globally, they are in a prime position to capture a larger brand, mind, wallet, and market share of the BNPL market giving them a significant upper hand against competitors.</p><h3>10- Top-Class Founder/CEO with Immense Credibility:</h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7414f3db-d1f9-4869-bad6-3a51f136dc71_680x651.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7414f3db-d1f9-4869-bad6-3a51f136dc71_680x651.png" width="386" height="369.53823529411767" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7414f3db-d1f9-4869-bad6-3a51f136dc71_680x651.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:651,&quot;width&quot;:680,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:386,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Image&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Image" title="Image" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7414f3db-d1f9-4869-bad6-3a51f136dc71_680x651.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7414f3db-d1f9-4869-bad6-3a51f136dc71_680x651.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7414f3db-d1f9-4869-bad6-3a51f136dc71_680x651.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7414f3db-d1f9-4869-bad6-3a51f136dc71_680x651.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4dec3e8b-de62-4558-941f-183127a06e7b_748x191.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4dec3e8b-de62-4558-941f-183127a06e7b_748x191.png" width="646" height="164.95454545454547" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4dec3e8b-de62-4558-941f-183127a06e7b_748x191.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:191,&quot;width&quot;:748,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:646,&quot;bytes&quot;:24394,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4dec3e8b-de62-4558-941f-183127a06e7b_748x191.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4dec3e8b-de62-4558-941f-183127a06e7b_748x191.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4dec3e8b-de62-4558-941f-183127a06e7b_748x191.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4dec3e8b-de62-4558-941f-183127a06e7b_748x191.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Max Levchin is not just any founder or CEO. &nbsp;A Ukrainian-American software engineer, and an immigrant whose parents moved to the US with only $700 during the reign of the Soviet Union.

We continue to see our customers Klarna, Affirm, Sezzle, Zip, Afterpay really focused on creating new payment types at the point of sale... The payment type is here to stay. So we're really seeing just strong sustained growth in this area. We've also talked about we've seen 71% of buy now pay later user survey said they're going to increase their usage from last year based on what we've seen in the market. 40% of consumers even tried buy now pay later last year. So the buy now pay later usage is definitely here to stay</em></p><p>&nbsp;The Global payments opportunity <a href="https://corporate.afterpay.com/investors/asx-announcements">is currently at $10 trillion</a> and BNPL is only 2% of the global payments as of 2021. Another unique aspect to <a href="https://investors.affirm.com/static-files/097f3211-8ea5-4a6d-9b86-6dfa969bbe8a">Affirm&#8217;s TAM is that over $1-Trillion</a> is spent by US Merchant on marketing and customer acquisition costs.&nbsp; Affirm gets to capture an aspect of this TAM.</p><p>It is clear there is a large opportunity to disrupt legacy payments and there is huge economic profit to be gained by Affirm. Another metric I watch is the growth of a Total Addressable Market. BNPL is still an emerging space in the US with growth potential. Affirm&#8217;s opportunity could grow even larger in the US because countries such as Germany and Australia have proven BNPL is possible based off their market penetration of 19% and 10% respectively.

Affirm has *unique access* to a vast amount of consumers across the US &amp; Canada. As they build all these products features discussed above, they have a *good distribution* channel to easily access, tap and upsell to these consumers who are already on their app and ecosystem with those merchants. This distribution channel with the largest merchants is a big competitive advantage over their competitors.</p><p>To wrap up this section.

The BNPL market opportunity will allow more than one player to win. </p><h2><strong>                    FINANCIALS</strong></h2><h3><strong>                  How Affirm Makes Money:</strong></h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F732f9df4-83a9-4c4c-bc82-f5d2243bb6e8_520x364.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F732f9df4-83a9-4c4c-bc82-f5d2243bb6e8_520x364.png" width="436" height="305.2" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/732f9df4-83a9-4c4c-bc82-f5d2243bb6e8_520x364.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:364,&quot;width&quot;:520,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:436,&quot;bytes&quot;:40404,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F732f9df4-83a9-4c4c-bc82-f5d2243bb6e8_520x364.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F732f9df4-83a9-4c4c-bc82-f5d2243bb6e8_520x364.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F732f9df4-83a9-4c4c-bc82-f5d2243bb6e8_520x364.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F732f9df4-83a9-4c4c-bc82-f5d2243bb6e8_520x364.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Affirm makes money through different sources. The primary source is merchant network revenue where Affirm earns a fee when they help convert a sale and facilitate a transaction for their merchants. These merchants&#8217; fees vary between products from as<a href="https://investors.affirm.com/static-files/097f3211-8ea5-4a6d-9b86-6dfa969bbe8a"> low as </a><strong><a href="https://investors.affirm.com/static-files/097f3211-8ea5-4a6d-9b86-6dfa969bbe8a">4% to 15%</a></strong><a href="https://investors.affirm.com/static-files/097f3211-8ea5-4a6d-9b86-6dfa969bbe8a"> based on the services</a> requested by a merchant. They generally earn larger merchant fees on 0% APR financing products and financial products with longer-term lengths. Merchants Revenue makes up around <strong>43%</strong> of GMV Revenue</p><p>Secondly, they generate revenue via interest income on the interest on loans from consumers through purchases from our originating bank partners. Interest rates charged to the consumer vary depending on the transaction risk, the creditworthiness of the consumer, the repayment term selected by the consumer, the amount of the loan, and the individual arrangement with a merchant. It&#8217;s important that what differentiates Affirm from a bank is that consumers are never charged deferred or compounding interest, late fees, or penalties on the loans. Also because Affirm has to re-pay the originating bank and remove the risk on their balance sheet, they are not incentivized to profit from consumers&#8217; hardships. This makes up <strong>37% of Revenue</strong>. Additionally, because Affirm sells Loans to their banking partners, they generate a gain of sale on loans which makes up <strong>10% of Revenue</strong>.</p><p>Third, They facilitate the issuance of virtual cards directly to consumers through the Affirm Consumer App which allows consumers to shop with merchants that may not yet be fully integrated with Affirm. When these virtual cards are used over established card networks, Affirm earns a portion of the interchange fee from the transaction. This makes up around <strong>6%</strong> of Revenue. <em><strong>PS Note: </strong>Cross-River bank originates the loan while they service the loan. Affirm acts as the servicer on all loans that they originate directly or purchase from their originating bank partners and they earn a servicing fee on loans they sell to their funding sources.</em></p><h3><strong>Financials &amp; Key Metrics to Track:</strong></h3><p>Below are Affirm&#8217;s Revenue Growth Rates over the past three fiscal years.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd21ee10-11a6-4c62-adff-b28cc9cc3864_589x416.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd21ee10-11a6-4c62-adff-b28cc9cc3864_589x416.png" width="397" height="280.39388794567066" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fd21ee10-11a6-4c62-adff-b28cc9cc3864_589x416.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:416,&quot;width&quot;:589,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:397,&quot;bytes&quot;:37967,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd21ee10-11a6-4c62-adff-b28cc9cc3864_589x416.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd21ee10-11a6-4c62-adff-b28cc9cc3864_589x416.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd21ee10-11a6-4c62-adff-b28cc9cc3864_589x416.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd21ee10-11a6-4c62-adff-b28cc9cc3864_589x416.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The focus was to highlight Affirm&#8217;s Competitive Strengths, so I&#8217;ll briefly touch on the financial metrics on a forward basis. Note that Affirm uses a different fiscal year, so I have adjusted their fiscal year to fit the normal calendar. Alternatively, view it as the last 6-quarters from left to right. The highlight numbers are my forward estimates. </p><p>Affirm&#8217;s GMV could possibly grow over 75% over the upcoming quarters due to the contributions of Amazon. </p><p>Revenue: &nbsp;Below are the historical revenue growth. Observe that Q2 is seasonally Affirm&#8217;s highest growing quarter due to Holiday shopping. I expect them to grow over 80% due to our discussions above and achieve FY 2022 Revenue of over 50% YoY.</p><p>Generally, Affirm gives a low beat rate and usually beats their guidance by 13-15%. If we can apply that metric, we might get a Q2 revenue growth of 80-85% YoY which would be around a 39% sequential Quarter-over-Quarter growth! Also, remember this financial guide excludes any deal with Amazon Partnership &amp; their new Affirm Debit+ where they plan to charge around 1.5% per transaction.</p><p>[Investi Analyst Metrics based on Affirm&#8217;s Historical Financials]</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6954187a-d8b6-4c94-a7bf-6a1cdde48b27_601x451.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6954187a-d8b6-4c94-a7bf-6a1cdde48b27_601x451.png" width="601" height="451" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6954187a-d8b6-4c94-a7bf-6a1cdde48b27_601x451.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:451,&quot;width&quot;:601,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:44270,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6954187a-d8b6-4c94-a7bf-6a1cdde48b27_601x451.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6954187a-d8b6-4c94-a7bf-6a1cdde48b27_601x451.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6954187a-d8b6-4c94-a7bf-6a1cdde48b27_601x451.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6954187a-d8b6-4c94-a7bf-6a1cdde48b27_601x451.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Valuation:</p><p>Affirm&#8217;s Market Cap is currently $38-billion and they have an enterprise value of $39B.

Affirm could grow over 60% - 70% over the next 2-years as they fully ramp up all their new partnerships. Using a sales multiple, Affirm is currently priced at 28x NTM Sales (Without Amazon).

Additionally, they can use it to build better product features. The waitlist (over 2-million consumers on the last recording) has grown exponentially which suggests this is an extremely popular product with huge financial upside for Affirm.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F896a5d7b-08c8-430a-b660-4d87f74289c9_428x308.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F896a5d7b-08c8-430a-b660-4d87f74289c9_428x308.png" width="316" height="227.4018691588785" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/896a5d7b-08c8-430a-b660-4d87f74289c9_428x308.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:308,&quot;width&quot;:428,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:316,&quot;bytes&quot;:165762,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F896a5d7b-08c8-430a-b660-4d87f74289c9_428x308.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F896a5d7b-08c8-430a-b660-4d87f74289c9_428x308.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F896a5d7b-08c8-430a-b660-4d87f74289c9_428x308.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F896a5d7b-08c8-430a-b660-4d87f74289c9_428x308.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div></li><li><p><strong>Consumer Product Announcements: </strong>Affirm is building a Super-App. Ultimately, this app could be a fully comprehensive Finance and eCommerce site for users to do shopping, payments and for consumers to find exclusive deals.&nbsp; Additionally, Affirm is building rewards and cash-back that will reward users.

They released Adaptive Checkouts which is a differentiated personalization of payment terms that has already been adopted by 44% of merchants. Finally, Affirm operates a <strong>Marketplace</strong> that has served as a great place for developing affiliate programs and has served as a place for lead generation for merchants. I discussed earlier, the merchant capital program that was released lately. </p><ul><li><p><strong>The Returns Market: </strong>Affirm acquired a company called Returnly that helps to manage situations where consumers want to return goods back to merchants quickly, easily, and efficiently. The value proposition of this acquisition is the ease of use for consumers to easily return expensive goods meanwhile the merchants have to worry less about managing the entire process. The goal is simply to save ease of time and Affirm makes up to 10% MDR rates by offering merchants these services.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>International and Canadian market growth with PayBright &amp;</strong> <strong>Apple Canada</strong>: Affirm recently announced their expansion with Peloton to Australia and have talked about growing with Shopify across international countries. Affirm has significant potential as they are currently one of the leading BNPL providers in Canada through their existing partnership with Apple Canada and their acquisition of Pay-Bright who has over 5,000+ merchants. The new Apple devices should accrue benefits to Affirm which spans both small and large purchases. The Canadian market is still less than &lt;5% penetrated.</p></li><li><p><strong>New Product Verticals: </strong>The BNPL market has significant potential to be vastly adopted within the Travel &amp; Ticketing, Restaurant, Mobile Payments, B2B BNPL, and Athletic fashion industry.

Hence, it is worthwhile to discuss the risk factors to my Investment Thesis:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Can Affirm&#8217;s BNPL be commoditized at scale</strong>: There is an argument that BNPL providers have no moat or competitive advantage, therefore any competitor can easily enter the market to erode growth.&nbsp; This report has enumerated areas that are difficult for competitors to replicate, so I would encourage readers to weigh the list above relative to areas they believe many competitors can replicate <strong>easily and quickly.</strong> The unique peculiar factor about Affirm is that they have over 10-years worth of data of risk modeling of consumers <strong>at scale</strong> over different <strong>market cycles,</strong> High Brand credibility with a 78 NPS, they have built a unique value proposition of underwriting high AoV transactions, unique payments technology for converting higher sales at checkout than their peers, they have a differentiated payment rail due to their access to SKU data that creates direct partnerships with product manufacturers and allows for different types of payments deals that excludes the credit card companies. Finally, they have a highly credible founder that has shown he can execute. Each of the following elements isn&#8217;t easily replicable by another provider <strong>quickly</strong>. Ultimately, most of the following reasons are behind why Amazon, Walmart and Shopify decided to partner with Affirm despite having the budget/resources to build a solution in-house. Finally, on the commoditization point, another reason why Affirm&#8217;s partnership with the largest eCommerce brands is key is that &#8220;if&#8221; BNPL becomes widely ubiquitous across the world with many players, it will be extremely important that early BNPL providers are able to lock in and create high-switching costs for the biggest merchants they have acquired early which is exactly what Affirm has done now. Based on all the following points above, it is quite clear that Affirm has carved out a niche with many competitive advantages that reduces or almost negates any competitor effect on Affirm&#8217;s business for the next couple of years. </p></li><li><p><strong>Competitive landscape from SQ/APT, Klarna or the networks (Visa)</strong>: Another risk is strong competition. We have discussed that Visa and Mastercard&#8217;s infrastructure limits their ability to offer the same BNPL services. Importantly, the recent announcement by MA/Visa is that they would be offering more  white-labeled BNPL solution for their merchants instead of direct BNPL services like Affirm. These network companies or banks won&#8217;t be able to charge such high MDR rates and they don&#8217;t offer consumer app to build that relationship with the consumers. The fact is that they can build their solution, but they are disadvantaged significantly compared to the direct BNPL players like Affirm from capturing the entire ecosystem.  </p><div id="youtube2-QVh6ynkxOsc" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;QVh6ynkxOsc&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QVh6ynkxOsc?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>Square and Afterpay (the leader in Fashion and Beauty apparells within BNPL) joining forces create a strong looped ecosystem to easily access over 50+ million consumers on Square&#8217;s Cash App and SMB Merchants. Secondly, Klarna is the largest BNPL provider globally and they have made major progress in capturing market share in the US beyond Europe where they have the biggest share.&nbsp;The differentiator for Affirm is their High AoV risk underwriting and their partnership with the largest retail merchants (or 60% of eCommerce) and their acquisition of one of the leading Canadian BNPL providers, PayBright puts them in a strong competitive position in the North American Market. is a big niche for Affirm. Secondly, based on a TAM that is over $1.5 Trillion, there is no reason why 3-major players can&#8217;t equally grow within the market by capturing specific niches. </p></li><li><p><strong>Liquidity and Interest rate concerns</strong>: There is always the risk that if there was a major liquidity crunch and a recession cycle that hit the capital markets, Affirm &#8216;could be&#8217; affected by consumer defaults and a liquidity crunch from the capital markets. While the current easy monetary policy and market liquidity won&#8217;t last forever, Consumers are still sitting on a significant amount of savings meanwhile Affirm has been shown to have one of the lowest loss ratios and effective AI models that have been utilized for over 10-years, there is no reason why any major shock to the system should entirely disrupt their business model. There are also chances that during tighter financial environments, consumers would rather pick BNPL to fund purchases. Lastly, Affirm&#8217;s business has such a wide variety of optionality and growth drivers that they can counteract any risks of the macro-enviroment  </p></li><li><p><strong>Operating Leverage and Profitability:</strong> Finally, one of the final questions I evaluate is if the business model can be profitable over the long term. The warrants issued to Amazon and Shopify will continue to eat huge a large chunk of expenses. In the meantime, it is important they continue to invest strategically to enhance their product moat and differentiation especially with their partnership with Amazon. However, for the next 1-2 years, it will be important that Affirm can rapidly grow its top-line revenue growth over 40-45% and market share within BNPL at scale to prove to investors they can eventually reach escape velocity to make the business run profitable long-term. </p></li></ol><p></p><h3><strong>Conclusion and Summary:</strong></h3><p>Buy-Now-Pay-Later is an emerging and nascent market that is on a mission to redefine how consumers pay and how merchants sell their products ever since the beginning of how installments payments redefined smartphone payments. </p><p>Financial services has not seen a business model that has such a powerful network effect and incentive to both the consumer and merchants since the model of Visa and Mastercard. </p><p>BNPL will not completely erase Credit Cards, however, it has the opportunity to capture at least 30-40% of the trillion-dollar Credit Industry. Buy-Now-Pay-Later is a wedge to the larger fintech market of becoming a comprehensive financial provider.</p><p>Affirm&#8217;s partnership with the largest enterprise eCommerce providers in the US further increases their bargaining power in acquiring new merchants, increases mindshare, brand in a large and early BNPL market that is disrupting traditional payments. Affirm may not have a completely defensible moat, but if you combine Affirm&#8217;s 2-network effects, vertically-integrated front and back-end infrastructure for merchants, brand awareness/trust, the breadth and depth of their underwriting prowess at scale, SKU Data Advantages and lastly, the credibility of the Founder/Management team. Hence, we have enough evidence to suggest that Affirm could be a larger company in a decades&#8217; time. </p><p></p><p><em>Additional Information &amp; Credits:</em></p><ol><li><p><em>Images above: Affirm Investor Relations</em></p></li><li><p><em>Alex Rampell at 16oz</em></p></li></ol><p><em><strong>Disclosures / Disclaimer</strong></em></p><p><em>Disclosure: I am long $AFRM.

They are responsible for improving the performance of web applications and optimizing the speed of digital experiences.</p><p>Cloudflare provides similar services as a content delivery network provider, but due to their technology architecture, they have evolved into more of a network cybersecurity company. Cloudflare places an emphasis on the reliability and security of a businesses&#8217; network.</p><p></p><p><strong>Brief Introduction to CDN&#8217;s:</strong></p><p>Content Delivery Networks (CDN) are distributed networks that act as an intermediary between the origin server (such as the Cloud) and the end-user's device (Like Laptop Computers). CDN's help to improve the speed on a webpage by reducing the distance (latency) between the end-users' web page request and the company's origin server using distributed networks (with Internet service providers) that are set-up across the globe. </p><p>The Cloud is behind these solutions. The main cloud providers realizing they needed to extend the capabilities of the cloud began creating end-point solutions like Application Programming Interface (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/API">API</a>) that make it easy for other companies to build on-top of their platforms. This led to the rise of the entire IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) industry and the rapid explosion of the Cloud in many key digital industries. Hence, Cloudflare and Fastly built their network solutions to complement these Cloud providers.</p><p>The next evolution of CDN is moving towards the&nbsp;<a href="https://edge.network/en/">Edge</a>&nbsp;as the amount of data generated outside of the private and public cloud data centre is a tailwind.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/doc/3889058-the-edge-completes-the-cloud-a-gartner-trend-insight-report">Gartner estimates</a>&nbsp;that over 70% of data in the next five years will be captured outside the cloud.&nbsp;<a href="https://edge.network/en/">Edge</a>&nbsp;networks are built on CDNs, but edge networking are decentralized network of servers that allow computation and data storage closer to the point of request. Rather than hundreds of teams performing massive analysis on one cloud server, the tasks can be decomposed into steps by using distributed networks.</p><p>Below is an explanationtion:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1512b6ff-9024-457a-9c37-0ebdd63fcdac_1024x512.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1512b6ff-9024-457a-9c37-0ebdd63fcdac_1024x512.png" width="568" height="284" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1512b6ff-9024-457a-9c37-0ebdd63fcdac_1024x512.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:512,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:568,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;What is Edge Computing&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="What is Edge Computing" title="What is Edge Computing" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1512b6ff-9024-457a-9c37-0ebdd63fcdac_1024x512.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1512b6ff-9024-457a-9c37-0ebdd63fcdac_1024x512.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1512b6ff-9024-457a-9c37-0ebdd63fcdac_1024x512.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1512b6ff-9024-457a-9c37-0ebdd63fcdac_1024x512.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>This image below explains the difference between Cloud computing and edge servers.

companies.</p><p><strong>Cloudflare:</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Cloudflare Workers</strong>: This is primarily focused on their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/5/7/17327584/edge-computing-cloud-google-microsoft-apple-amazon">Edge Compute Platform</a>. This product has the biggest potential over the next 10-years. Cloudflare's strategy is to make Workers the most powerful AI development platform in the world. This is one of the reasons behind their Nvidia Partnership. They want to improve performance on their platform. </p><p>Workers is built using isolates, as they are extremely fast and lightweight. The CEO has emphasized that compliance with security regulations, ease of use, cost and speed will be important to their Edge platform success. They have increased the number of programming languages capable on their platform.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cloudflare for Teams:</strong> This is their cybersecurity product. It has the biggest potential over the next couple of years as security continues to be an important issue for governments and corporations. I will explain more of this product in my cybersecurity section. </p></li></ol><p><strong>Fastly:</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Compute@Edge: </strong>This is their big potential product line. They continues to focus on Speed and performance of their platform. Similarly to Cloudflare, Fastly is betting that this product will drive significant gains for the company. They want to capitalize on their pre-existing speed advantage within CDN and apply it to their edge platform. </p></li><li><p><strong>Secure@Edge</strong>: This is their core security product from the signal science acquisition. More on this later.</p></li></ol><p></p><h3><strong>Similarities between Cloudflare and Fastly: </strong></h3><p>The similarities between both platform is their Content delivery network origins, their Software defined network (SDN) architecture and serverless platform capability.</p><h4>The <strong>differences </strong>begin to emerge:</h4><ol><li><p>Their <strong>web assembly technology</strong> architecture. (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Concepts">Web Assembly meaning</a>, a new type of code that can be run in modern web browsers and provides new features and improvements in performance. The goal is to make programming more efficient and easy. Cloudflare&#8217;s web assembly is focused on using a V8 isolate in a browser meanwhile Fastly built their own browser system called Lucet. This Lucet architecture is incredibly faster than anyone on the market. </p></li><li><p><strong>Cybersecurity Differences</strong> is that Cloudflare is becoming more of a networking and cybersecurity company meanwhile, Fastly is primarily an application-based security provider.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://blog.stackpath.com/point-of-presence/">PoP (Point of Presence</a>) Capacity</strong>: Fastly has more PoP and greater network capability. Fastly has around 130 TB/Sec compared to Cloudflare&#8217;s 69 Tb/sec. By having higher capacity, it means a company can handle large sudden volume in traffic than the other.

SASE Networks and Zero Trust. &nbsp;&nbsp;Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) can be simply defined as the merging of enterprise networking systems and security into one comprehensive solution. This form of Cybersecurity has been especially important in a virtual world of remote working and cloud computing and digitalization. To read more about SASE, read this <a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/andrew-lerner/2019/12/23/say-hello-sase-secure-access-service-edge/">Gartner report</a>. Team is making Cloudflare more of an enterprise network provider with a scalable VPN and firewall replacement.</p></li><li><p><strong>Zero Trust security</strong> is a modern security service of not trusting anybody within an enterprise which means requiring authentication at every stage of access. This security approach helps to limit the damages by bad actors on a company&#8217;s network. Incorporating Zero-trust security, Cloudflare Access, Magic firewall and Transit and their networking capabilities to launch Cloudflare One for the enterprise has enabled Cloudflare become a full-fledged cybersecurity company. This is primarily the reason they compete against Z-Scaler and legacy security names like Fortinet, Netskope etc. because these companies have similar offerings.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Fastly&#8217;s Strategy:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Historically, Fastly only had a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection solution but acquired Signal Sciences to beef up their security portfolio, within web application, edge server security, API protection solutions, and more areas listed above in the image. </p></li><li><p>Signal Sciences provides a next-gen Web Application Firewall to mitigate against compromising websites and users' data.

Cloudflare targets a wider audience and offers a freemium model (a business model in which a company offers basic features to users at no cost and charges a premium for supplemental or advanced features). Developers have access to a good portion of their services free of charge and this is a reason why Cloudflare is popular amongst developers. The strategy is built to acquire, expand, and extend amongst the masses. Overtime, they have a large pool (over 4-million developers now) to allow them perform sales at a cheaper price and they can also do research and development amongst those clients.</p><p>Fastly&#8217;s goal is to target large clients with big budgets. They target companies with large IT departments that can use their platform very frequently and increase their spending/usage on the platform.</p><p>The difference in market size and target audience

Also, in view of their consumption business model, they have a much higher Dollar-Based Net retention rate of 139% as at Q1 2021. Since the last three quarters, those numbers have declined from a high of 147% in Q3 2020 to 141% in Q4 2020 and now 139% (another issue for Wall Street). Also, their net retention metrics have steadily declined from a high of 138% in Q2 2020 to 122%, 115% and recently in Q1 2021 to 107% (another issue for Wall Street).</p><p>Meanwhile for Cloudflare, they have   more of a SaaS-like business model. Their retention metrics has been growing upwards. Their DBNER has been high among their large paying customers - accelerating from 117% to a high of 123%. Cloudflare is showing signals of increasing customer stickiness. Beyond the DBNER retention metric, 88% of Cloudflare's contracted customers now use four or more of Cloudflare products, up significantly from over two-years ago.</p><h1><strong>FINANCIALS</strong></h1><p><strong>REVENUE GROWTH RATES:</strong></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb51ee5e-9a53-4d97-8238-81384b159915_534x221.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb51ee5e-9a53-4d97-8238-81384b159915_534x221.png" width="622" height="257.4194756554307" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cb51ee5e-9a53-4d97-8238-81384b159915_534x221.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:221,&quot;width&quot;:534,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:622,&quot;bytes&quot;:45490,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb51ee5e-9a53-4d97-8238-81384b159915_534x221.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb51ee5e-9a53-4d97-8238-81384b159915_534x221.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb51ee5e-9a53-4d97-8238-81384b159915_534x221.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb51ee5e-9a53-4d97-8238-81384b159915_534x221.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><ul><li><p>Cloudflare is growing faster than Fastly. </p></li><li><p>&nbsp;Cloudflare is much diversified internationally with only 52% coming from US.

They should continue to do well as edge networks and the need for distributed networks grow as secular tailwinds breakout in AR/VR, Autonomous driving, digital experiences and more continue to grow.</p><h4>Cloudflare Summary:</h4><ul><li><p>With the launch of their integrated product suite of Cloudflare One &#8211; It is very clear now that Cloudflare is becoming a <strong>networking </strong>and <strong>Cybersecurity </strong>company. They focus on network <strong>reliability</strong>, speed &amp; <strong>performance </strong>and <strong>security </strong></p></li><li><p>Cloudflare has a more advanced software defined architecture that allows for maximum virtualization and flexibility to organically build many products on their edge platform, for example their Cloudflare workers.</p></li><li><p>They have one of the complete suite of SASE networks and Zero-trust security on the market. This is unique. Hence they should be compared to the Cybersecurity players. The best evidence is that the company will benefiting from <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3696854-baird-parses-biden-cybersecurity-order-for-impacted-stocks">Biden&#8217;s cybersecurity push</a>.</p></li><li><p>They have successfully expanded their TAM into larger areas of cybersecurity, as they have built a complete suite of product for the market creating a massive runway for growth.</p></li><li><p>The upscaling of their product strategy and sales team has led to massive growth within large scale enterprise organizations. They have access to over 4-million developers to help their R&amp;D efforts. </p></li><li><p>Cloudflare has higher revenues in amount and growth rate [50% 5YR CAGR]</p></li><li><p>They have a higher gross margin, operating margins due to their unique SDN architecture and are becoming cash flow positive, generating more cash from operations.</p></li><li><p>Culture-wise, it appears Cloudflare is innovating faster with higher product cadence and releases.</p></li><li><p>Cloudflare is gaining significant momentum in the large enterprise part of the market. Secondly, if Cloudflare decided to make major enhancements to their browser based architecture by adopting Lucet&#8217;s then it could be game over.</p></li><li><p>The company faces execution and competitive risks (from Okta, Z-Scaler) as they venture into new areas and markets. Magic WAN/Magic transit firewall is a SaaS solution that allows customers to securely connect data, devices, cloud networks.</p></li></ul><p>Overall, Cloudflare is currently the leading fastest growing networking company aiming to become the premier platform for Cybersecurity, web performance and network reliability. This is a key reason for their premium valuation amongst the best SaaS companies in the industry.</p><p><strong>Fastly Summary:</strong></p><ul><li><p>The story is not over. Fastly is still the go-to-platform for the world&#8217;s biggest digital media brands like Stripe, Pinterest, Shopify etc. Their strategy is to have the best platform for streaming digital content online. This is why they are doubling down on increasing their network capability.</p></li><li><p>Fastly should be compared to Akamai and other CDN players. Fastly is still the fastest CDN provider amongst Cloud providers.</p></li><li><p>They &#8216;arguably&#8217; have the best and unique technology based on their CDN web assembly, PoP and Lucet network architecture. </p></li><li><p>They have an advanced, next-generation WAF security product with signal sciences that ensures privacy and application-level security. This is ranked highly by Gartner.</p></li><li><p>Although retention is dropping, the product is still showing stickiness due to their high dollar and net retention rates.</p></li><li><p>In this past quarter, they showed they could add a significant number of new clients, but importantly need to prove to investors that this growth rate can be sustainable and become much more higher overtime.</p></li><li><p>There has are more risk factors with Fastly &#8211; a low-down in growth, customer retention and slow product cadence. Also, fixing the management team issues around finding a solid CRO &amp; CFO. </p></li><li><p>They have the best technology but have problems on the execution aspect within the market. They need to show Wall Street, they can build on its edge platform, attract new customers and drive the top-line revenue growth.</p></li><li><p>I retain a buy only because of its discount valuation relative to their technology capabilities and 35% growth profile. Also, Fastly should continue to benefit from tailwinds as Edge compute grows over 30% over the next couple of years. The CEO said: &#8220;2021 is a year where we will be getting the marquee examples and cases out there, and 2022 is when this will have a meaningful impact on revenue.

My financial valuation thesis suggests a price target of $45-$50 based on upon Palantir generating over $1.7B in Revenues in 2021 due to the significant boost the company has received from the signing of new contracts since Q4 2020.</p><p>My technology thesis for Palantir is built upon Palantir's Foundry future growth potential and the capabilities of Foundry to penetrate more Fortune 500 Companies over the next decade.&nbsp;I expect the commercial business to become the main revenue driver by 2025 based upon their synergetic partnership with IBM. This makes me equally bullish on IBM's AI ambitions. Both companies could become a leading force in the AI Race.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The article goes into depth because I want Investors to connect the dots between <a href="https://investors.palantir.com/news">Palantir's new contracts and partnerships</a>&nbsp;over the last six months. You'll observe that majority of them have been centered around industrial-related, automotive and life-science based companies. IBM is considered a major leader within the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/industries/be-en/manufacturing/cognitive-manufacturing-outcomes/">industrial technological</a> revolution powered by AI. It appears building their capacity within these three industry sectors is one of the company's strategic objective.</p><p>The outline of this article is structured in the following; I begin with a Palantir Foundry Refresher of my past article. I explain the goal of the Double-Click Demo Event Series. I explain the Industrial Demo Expectations&nbsp; and expand upon the rise of the Industrial Internet of Things and how Palantir is redefining the next generation of industrial manufacturing with some recent partnership examples. I provide an extensive explanation of IBM's Cloud capabilities and&nbsp;explain how Palantir&#8217;s Foundry partnership with IBM creates a powerful synergy that will accelerate growth for both companies. I'll then explain the Life-Science demo expectations. I wrap up with a valuation rationale and Bottom-line conclusions.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/p/optional-read-palantir-understandings?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/p/optional-read-palantir-understandings?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p><h2><strong>Palantir Foundry Refresher:</strong></h2><p>I made a case in my Feb 21, <a href="https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/p/palantir-technologies-ignore-gotham">Palantir: Forget Gotham City, Foundry Has The Untapped Potential</a> on why investors of Palantir should reduce their focus on Palantir&#8217;s Gotham business which is primarily Government and pay more attention to Foundry, Palantir's Commercial Application because this business appears to be the future growth driver for expanding their Total Addressable Market Opportunity. Since that article, Palantir has announced a few new partnerships amongst commercial organizations.&nbsp; </p><p>In that article, I discussed how Palantir's Foundry is built around four key premises and strengths. The foundations are; i) The Data Integration prowess of Palantir's Foundry for integrating and analyzing massive disparate datasets.&nbsp; &nbsp;ii) Knowledge management, Ontology-based models &amp; Classification of large amounts of data.&nbsp; iii) Search, Analysis &amp; Discovery capabilities and, iv) Enabling collaboration both within an enterprise and externally amongst industries with a clean low-code, no-code interface for business users.&nbsp;</p><p>Palantir's software is built on an architecture of complex pieces of software on the back-end, which enables the front-end look simple with their "low-code, no-code" user interface for both technical and non-technical individuals. The software can manage complex situations such as battlefield scenarios <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/12/13/palantir-deepens-its-pentagon-business-with-new-million-army-contract/">for the US Army</a> or for the National Security Agencies for high-profile investigations where situations are constantly changing. The ability to apply this data expertise from an unstable environment towards an enterprise/customer behaviour where things are slightly more controlled, than a battlefield shows the immense future capabilities Foundry could impact upon organizations especially when combined with the new features that IBM will bring to the table (More on this later). Based off my experience working on a Data Science team, Palantir is solving a key problem for many organizations.</p><h2><strong>What is Double-Click?</strong></h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F072f5ffe-b9c8-4e8c-a561-864f0e198c87_640x362.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F072f5ffe-b9c8-4e8c-a561-864f0e198c87_640x362.png" width="640" height="362" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/072f5ffe-b9c8-4e8c-a561-864f0e198c87_640x362.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:362,&quot;width&quot;:640,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F072f5ffe-b9c8-4e8c-a561-864f0e198c87_640x362.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F072f5ffe-b9c8-4e8c-a561-864f0e198c87_640x362.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F072f5ffe-b9c8-4e8c-a561-864f0e198c87_640x362.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F072f5ffe-b9c8-4e8c-a561-864f0e198c87_640x362.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><em><a href="https://www.palantir.com/double-click/">Source: Palantir Double Click/Investor Relations</a></em></p><p>Double-click is a series of software demo events where Palantir will show how their platforms are being used across a variety of industries.

When we discuss industrial, we are looking at sectors that are capital and asset intensive such as Oil &amp; Gas Energy company, Airplane &amp; Aerospace manufacturers, manufacturing companies etc.</p><p>The next decade will see the unleashing of the next industrial revolution 4.0 (also called the fourth industrial revolution) of intelligent machines, robots and where capital intensive industries will become the new digital businesses. This Industrial revolution 4.0 will be powered by the Industrial Internet of Things (also called IIoT).&nbsp;Industrial IoT is defined as a set of integrated software capabilities that enhance operational visibility, control and augments the connection between machine-to-machines and devices-to-human for companies within the Industrial context.</p><p>Industrial IoT utilizes multiple number of external sensors, detectors and monitoring devices that are then connected with a manufacturing software application which allow for instant communication, enhanced real-time data collection and analysis, and further enabling efficiency and automation in the industrial context. As seen below, IoT will power smart factories, smart cities with better transportation, heavy machines, factories etc.</p><p>Similar to the Consumer IoT devices that we have in our homes for our Fitbit, home monitoring items such as tracking home lightings, alarm detectors that work with an Amazon Alexa or Google's Nest,&nbsp;we can apply the same technology to an industrial context to interconnect applications that improve the entire industrial process for asset-intensive companies.</p><p>Below is an example of how Industrial IoT can be applied in manufacturing. To enable thousands of sensors and IoT devices become intelligent so as to drive automation and the future of manufacturing, they need to be powered and enabled by advanced data analytics, machine learning models, big data, cloud compute, edge computing, 5G networks and cybersecurity. This is where Palantir and eventually IBM's Watson play a role by providing the technology stack to enable IIoT for companies.&nbsp;IBM is considered a leader and I will discuss more on this later.&nbsp;Additionally, Palantir Foundry has the analytical capabilities that enables more proactive, data-driven root cause analysis and problem identification before issues occur to avoid system failures and unplanned downtime. This is based off the way Foundry collects and analyzes data from thousands of devices and sensors around a plant or operational environment "within a few clicks" as Palantir would infer.

This was an important concept discussed at the last demo and mentioned multiple times. A digital twin is a digital and virtual replication of a company&#8217;s physical assets, processes and systems. Within an industrial context, it allows for companies to conduct experimentation without shutting down a system or a plant.&nbsp;Digital twins deliver significant amount of business value by allowing companies to better predict the future and better detect issues before they arise.&nbsp;Palantir's technology has helped many industrial organizations create the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/03/06/what-is-digital-twin-technology-and-why-is-it-so-important/?sh=5f1e84fc2e2a">Digital Twin</a>  and model simulations powered by their Foundry ontology models.

On a computer software, a business user on the right can see all that information, conduct analysis and perform real-time simulations of the factory through Palantir&#8217;s Foundry.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F636e2bf5-bb68-4a82-bea1-c3c48f2b09c8_640x216.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F636e2bf5-bb68-4a82-bea1-c3c48f2b09c8_640x216.png" width="640" height="216" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/636e2bf5-bb68-4a82-bea1-c3c48f2b09c8_640x216.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:216,&quot;width&quot;:640,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F636e2bf5-bb68-4a82-bea1-c3c48f2b09c8_640x216.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F636e2bf5-bb68-4a82-bea1-c3c48f2b09c8_640x216.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F636e2bf5-bb68-4a82-bea1-c3c48f2b09c8_640x216.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F636e2bf5-bb68-4a82-bea1-c3c48f2b09c8_640x216.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><em><a href="https://vimeo.com/488141017">Source: Palantir's Inaugural Live Demo Day</a></em></p><h4>Some Industrial Results So Far:</h4><p>Some of the results has been exhibited in their most recent partnership announcements over the last 7 months.</p><p>The recent&nbsp;<a href="https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2021/Palantir--bp-Deepen-Partnership-Accelerate-Energy-Transition">BP Energy Partnership</a>  is an evidence of the positive results - Palantir has already delivered due to the enhancements in BP's hydrocarbon-based workflows. Palantir says "<em>We continue to support BP&#8217;s efforts in risk monitoring, including workflows around infrastructure management, and information flow management</em>." Palantir also supported the <a href="https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/news-and-insights/reimagining-energy/apex-digital-system.html">BP Digital Twin </a>which has yielded concrete results in providing a more efficient operations management, better modelling of scenarios, asset allocation and has saved BP Energy over <a href="https://blog.palantir.com/launching-erp-suite-to-deliver-cost-savings-for-aws-customers-ceed6e6dd927">$50-million in cost-savings.</a></p><p>Another evidence is the success of their&nbsp;<a href="https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2021/Palantir-Technologies-and-Rio-Tinto-Sign-Multi-Year-Enterprise-Partnership">Rio Tinto Partnership</a>&nbsp;regarding connecting people with data at Rio Tinto&#8217;s underground operations for mining metals and copper. Foundry's&nbsp;software integrates data from a multitude of disparate on-field sources through hundreds of sensors, machines and human data and then on Foundry, users can create sophisticated analysis to better improve mining operations.</p><h2><strong>IBM's Watson and Palantir's Foundry Synergies:</strong></h2><p>I will explain how IBM's Watson and Foundry work together to create synergies that are being utilized to solve those key problems across the Life Sciences and industrial sectors.</p><p>First, IBM's key competitive advantage and strengths are built on their underlying data architecture and being the world's most robust hybrid-cloud platform provider especially with the <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2019-07-09-IBM-Closes-Landmark-Acquisition-of-Red-Hat-for-34-Billion-Defines-Open-Hybrid-Cloud-Future">acquisition of Red-Hat</a>. They are also great with infrastructure modernization and network hosting service management. Second, Palantir's key strength is their data integration prowess, their ability to bring AI into operational software applications, and transforming raw data into actionable insights through a low-code, no-code clean interface for non-technical business users.&nbsp;</p><p>For this partnership, IBM will use their Cloud-Pak for Data to connect to multiple legacy systems together and handle all the messy data in organization underneath within databases. The illustration below shows how IBM's Cloud Pak provides the underlying Foundation at the bottom and Palantir's Application takes over at the upper funnel by transforming those raw datasets into AI insights for all the business Users and stakeholders across an organization.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a384d76-0de9-4e21-8d8c-d143a8fec814_640x538.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a384d76-0de9-4e21-8d8c-d143a8fec814_640x538.png" width="640" height="538" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1a384d76-0de9-4e21-8d8c-d143a8fec814_640x538.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:538,&quot;width&quot;:640,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a384d76-0de9-4e21-8d8c-d143a8fec814_640x538.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a384d76-0de9-4e21-8d8c-d143a8fec814_640x538.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a384d76-0de9-4e21-8d8c-d143a8fec814_640x538.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a384d76-0de9-4e21-8d8c-d143a8fec814_640x538.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><em><a href="https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/data-and-ai-applications-with-palantir-for-ibm-cloud-pak-for-data/">Source:&nbsp;IBM Cloud Pak for Data</a></em></p><p>This partnership will be utilized across many industries, but let us apply it back to our Industrial transformation use-case. It is important to note that in order to build a coherent Industrial IoT Strategy, you need strong cloud computing, data management architecture, security and integration capabilities to capture thousands of data points as mentioned earlier above. This is where both companies synergies come together and&nbsp;IBM plays a big role. According to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-24FUCVJS&amp;ct=201022&amp;st=sb">Gartner Industrial Internet Report</a>, IBM's Watson IIoT platform helps assist industrial companies through the delivery of their hybrid-cloud services on the IBM Cloud (everything above). There is a high amount of Cloud Computing required to make Industrial IoT successful. IBM serves this need and IBM is really good with asset monitoring for manufacturing and transportation services. IBM's Watson also has a wide and deep set of AI functionalities to build Industrial IoT-enabled business solutions.&nbsp;IBM has been investing significantly into hybrid cloud and AI over the last few years especially with their new CEO.&nbsp;</p><p>Palantir complements IBM's Cloud data by helping with the scaling of AI models into operational aspects of a business by creating a clean and easy analytics UI interface for business decision-makers. Below is Gartner's Research Magic Quadrant for Industrial IoT Platforms where they perform in-depth market&nbsp;evaluation. You'll note that IBM ranks as only a&nbsp;Niche Player. This is because they lack a full solution and don't have any on-premise operational platforms (like a low-code, no-code UI solution of Palantir) for customers as compared to Hitachi or Microsoft. IBM has lacked an integrated visionary product stack like Microsoft where they have Tableau and Azure.&nbsp; IBM only provides a managed collection of cloud services on their IBM Cloud. They are simply great at providing anything cloud.&nbsp;</p><p>This transformation thesis for both companies will playout over multiple years and there are bound to be challenges. On a high-level, some of the key risks of this IIoT thesis is that many organizations face challenges around the significant upfront costs of investing into building these full AI stacks, then there are challenges around cybersecurity, lack of standardization, data integration and data integrity issues. However, I believe this is why key alliances and partnerships are being forged to drive down the cost-curve for more organizations.</p><p><em><strong>Foundry will redefine the future of Industrials</strong></em></p><p>We can gradually see that IBM Cloud Pak Data Services and Palantir's Foundry partnership goes beyond just leveraging the salesforce at IBM, but it does bring together a combined technology expertise to create significant synergies to help businesses scale AI. The positions both companies to lead the AI Race in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>The bottom-line here is that Foundry is becoming a central operating system not only for the individual corporate enterprise but also for global industrial organizations. The old way of manufacturing and production involved significant human labour to monitor plants and manufacturing processes that led to significant waste and inefficiencies. The future of manufacturing will be digitized. Palantir is powering all these intelligent sensors that automate and optimize the entire manufacturing process. Similarly to how Google and Amazon were key pioneers in the Consumer IoT markets that made our homes much more efficient. Palantir and IBM are leading the transformation of smart and intelligent industrial factories of the future.</p><p></p><h2>2) Life Sciences Demo Expectations:</h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0c962b5-02e4-41fe-bd30-17d4eaba9fad_640x447.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0c962b5-02e4-41fe-bd30-17d4eaba9fad_640x447.png" width="640" height="447" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a0c962b5-02e4-41fe-bd30-17d4eaba9fad_640x447.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:447,&quot;width&quot;:640,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0c962b5-02e4-41fe-bd30-17d4eaba9fad_640x447.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0c962b5-02e4-41fe-bd30-17d4eaba9fad_640x447.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0c962b5-02e4-41fe-bd30-17d4eaba9fad_640x447.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa0c962b5-02e4-41fe-bd30-17d4eaba9fad_640x447.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><em><a href="https://www.palantir.com/double-click/">Source: Palantir's Double Click</a></em></p><p>Palantir will demonstrate how Foundry is being used by customers that are Healthcare providers, biopharmaceuticals, hospitals, clinical research and medical research institutions. Palantir will show how Foundry is enabling the creation of the comprehensive patient picture by bringing together and analyzing vast amounts of clinical, observational, and molecular data to better predict health outcomes. The company may showcase how their ontology-based models can handle these situations. It is important to note that over a thousand researchers at the National Institute of Health (NIH) and NHS England National are currently using Foundry to manage Covid-19 initiatives from vaccine supply-management to managing Covid health records of citizens. We may also learn about their partnerships with the <a href="https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/NCATS-Awards-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-36M-Contract-to-Support-its-Secure-Scientific-Platforms-Environment">National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)</a> and <a href="https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Syntropy-Joins-MITREs-Mission-to-Unlock-the-Power-of-Real-World-Data-for-Cancer-Research-and-Treatment">Syntropy-EMD Digital Partnerships</a> (a subsidiary of Merck) where they are advancing cancer research. In both of these two scientific partnerships, Foundry's software is enabling several critical health projects through the integration, management, security, analysis and transforming of scientific data into insights.</p><p>There are major confidential and privacy issues surrounding patient health data, but Palantir has advanced security capabilities. They should showcase how their security technology features enables the safety of patient data through purpose-based access controls, a Foundry feature. They should briefly discuss their Data Governance protocols, strategy and how it is administered.</p><p>Overall, the pandemic has accelerated their work within Healthcare and Life Sciences. Investors will observe that they signed extension contracts with the US Government <a href="http://NIH%E2%80%99s%20National%20COVID%20Cohort%20Collaborative">National Institute for Health</a>, the <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3642146-palantir-stock-jumpsplus-12-on-report-of-new-fda-contract">US FDA $40M Contract</a> and the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201223005018/en/Palantir-Continues-Vital-NHS-Work-With-31.5M-Contract">UK National Health Service (NHS England)</a> to help track the spread of COVID-19, vaccine supply-chain management, using their software to support clinical trials and research. I believe the Life Sciences sector has the capacity to drive significant future returns. We know that Post-Covid, there is bound to be significant budget allocation towards stopping the next major pandemic. Artificial Intelligence will play a central role in helping with the development of a solution towards the next age of significant drug discovery. There are massive opportunities to apply Artificial Intelligence to Genomics and lead the next transformation in Healthcare, but we won't spend too much time on that for this article.</p><h3>Brief Thoughts on Valuation:</h3><p>My financial valuation thesis suggests a price target of $45-$50 based on the fact that Palantir could generate more than $1.7Billion in Revenue for 2021. I will also add that we've observed an improvement in contribution margins from 21% in 2019 to 54% in 2020 further supporting Palantir's scale. I don't expect Non-GAAP profitability in 2021. All this leads to my price target of $45-$50 suggesting a Forward P/S of 25x on my 2021 Revenue estimates or Forward EV/Sales of 24x as at the time of writing. This valuation is not unreasonable if they grow over &gt;55%+ YoY in 2021. The biggest risk to my valuation will be the market rotation to value and the relative direction of interest rates and their impact on valuation multiples.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Bottom-Line and Conclusions:</strong></h2><p>Palantir's first Demo-day event in January was a success. After the last demo-day, the COO - Shyam Sankar stated on the <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4406413-palantir-technologies-pltr-alex-karp-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript">earnings call</a> that the event was well received by both investors and prospective clients. He mentioned they got more inbound calls and interested partners. I expect these series of Double click events to continue to further drive this momentum.&nbsp;Palantir has long been described <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/palantir-peter-thiel-public-prospectus-nyse-ice/">by the press as being 'secretive</a>' and lacking transparency. I strongly believe that Palantir's Double Click is a desire to change this narrative.</p><p>Palantir is a technically complex company making a large societal impact, but most of this impact is largely unknown to the world. My hope is that after reading this article, you'll begin to connect the dots amongst all of the partnerships that were announced over the last seven months including future announcements and see how it may tie-in to digitizing the industrial and life-science industries. I hope you&nbsp;get a few foundational elements of their technology and can see the impact Palantir is having in various aspects of the world's leading industries not discussed by the media (my article is only a quarter of Palantir's impact around the world, there are many areas not discussed).&nbsp;This is the reason I thought it would be important for Investors to get a full grasp of the future potential of both companies.&nbsp;If we combine IBM's AI deep expertise and Palantir's Foundry capabilities, we would realize an AI powerhouse is being built.</p><p>If you missed out on the event, I plan to do a post-analysis of the event where I will discuss the key takeaways for Investors. I will also like to learn about your expectations or takeaways for this event in the comment section. I'll wrap up by saying the current market underestimates the potential synergies between Palantir's Foundry and IBM's Watson. In a decade's time and as Double Click evolves, the world will begin to realize the enormous potential Palantir has built 'in-secret' over the last 18-years.&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you for reading!

Their goal is to become the new age bank for millennials and Gen-Z. SoFi is built around the premise of enabling customers borrow, save, spend and invest for their future. The company was founded in 2011 by students in their early days at Stanford University. They started as a community-based student debt management platform that helped students with financing loans. Since that moment, they have grown to become a $15Billion company. They have a purposeful mission which is centered around helping their members get their money right (note - they don&#8217;t call them &#8216;<em><strong>customers</strong></em>&#8217;)</p><p>They provide their members with services such as lending, student loans, home loans or loans based off their personal needs. They also recently launched&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/84717/sofi-launches-credit-card">SoFi credit card</a>&nbsp;which provides 2% unlimited cash back on all purchases when users redeem into a related SoFi product. They have an investing platform that enables customers buy and sell stocks including cryptocurrencies.  SoFi strives to educate and set-up their members for a bright financial future. People learn, follow, and share insights within the SoFi community. Simply, they have everything in one platform. </p><p>The image below shows all the services that SoFi offers to their customers on the outer blue bands. Meanwhile, the inner circle shows their value proposition and how they differentiate themselves: </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17332c2d-5dde-4d69-91f6-a6ca3d55cf78_409x302.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17332c2d-5dde-4d69-91f6-a6ca3d55cf78_409x302.png" width="409" height="302" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/17332c2d-5dde-4d69-91f6-a6ca3d55cf78_409x302.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:302,&quot;width&quot;:409,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:61469,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17332c2d-5dde-4d69-91f6-a6ca3d55cf78_409x302.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17332c2d-5dde-4d69-91f6-a6ca3d55cf78_409x302.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17332c2d-5dde-4d69-91f6-a6ca3d55cf78_409x302.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17332c2d-5dde-4d69-91f6-a6ca3d55cf78_409x302.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><ol><li><p><em>Speed</em>: SoFi strives to be the platform that enables the fastest way to do everything banking which entails becoming a platform which enables the member get quick access to money (whether you are borrowing or making an application), ease of opening an account or depositing checks etc. </p></li><li><p><em>Selection</em>: The goal is to become a financial platform that provides a broad array of products across a member&#8217;s lifecycle with unique terms and at attractive value prices.</p></li><li><p><em>Convenience</em>: SoFi&#8217;

Lending is almost a trillion-dollar industry. This is the oldest part of the business and SoFi generates a significant part of their revenue (&gt;50%) from their Lending Services today.</p><p><em><strong>2)&nbsp;Financial Services:  </strong></em>This is the core banking service of the business that provides Saving and Spending platforms. They have an Investing platform for stocks similar to (Robinhood or Wealthsimple in Canada). They have Relay, money management and Protect services. The company hopes to expand its breadth in Financial Services by obtaining a bank charter. I will expand upon this later.</p><p><em><strong>3)&nbsp;Galileo Technology Platform: </strong></em>This was a company that they acquired in 2020 for over $1.2Billion and has become a part of SoFi. Galileo isn&#8217;t a bank and isn&#8217;t a regulated entity, but it empowers Fintech platforms. Galileo provides an API - all the technology required to offer digital banking services without having a physical bank presence. It maintains a ledger, authorization settlement, funds movements and managing fraud all digitally. More on this below. </p><h3>Competitive Advantages: </h3><p>The future competitive advantage for SoFi primarily lies within these last two business segments. </p><p><strong>a) Bank charter could be game-changing:</strong></p><p>SoFi has applied for a bank charter that is likely to be approved. This charter will allow SoFi to take deposits from its customers and make loans using these deposits (similar to a normal bank). This enhances the value proposition for SoFi members while driving down costs versus the current process of financing their loan offerings as a non-bank. This would allow SoFi conduct normal banking operations without the legacy brick-and-mortar infrastructure which then creates a cheaper base for SoFi to make loans to its customers. The charter benefits includes a lower cost of capital and increased Net-Interest Margin on holding deposits and loans longer.</p><p>GPG Acquisition: SoFi announced an agreement to acquire Golden Pacific Bancorp, Inc (a small community bank in Sacramento, California) this year. The acquisition of this bank will help speed up its application and wait for approval. Currently, SoFi acts as a non-bank lender. As a result, they are required to develop a partnership with a third-party bank that acts as a middleman. This lowers their EBITDA margins and drives up the cost for their members to borrow money. Following the approval of a bank charter, this would also benefit product differentiation amongst other fintech competitors and drive down customer acquisition costs. If you combine a charter and the existing comprehensive platform that SoFi operates today, this could lead to a big moat.  </p><p><strong>b) The Moat from Galileo BaaS Platform: </strong></p><p>Galileo dominates the Banking as a Service (BaaS) ecosystem. Similar to the Cloud and SaaS services that technology companies offer different organizations. BaaS aims to provide an easy platform that reduces both the time and cost fintech companies spend&nbsp;on getting regulatory requirements or licenses. BaaS provides digital banks with third-party access to core systems and functionality so that they can integrate digital banking and payment services into their own product. Also, BaaS reduces the technology requirements and capabilities to offer financial products such as maintaining account ledgers for different customer accounts that is required of a traditional bank. BaaS provides significant cost savings and this is the future of Fintech banking. </p><p>The reason for this explanation is that Galileo is the leader of the new BaaS Infrastructure. Galileo&#8217;s powerful payment processing platform offers the easiest way to create sophisticated payment card programs and digital banking solutions. Similar to the AWS Cloud service, Galileo is the underlying infrastructure for Finance Technology. Think of it as the way Amazon created cloud infrastructure enabling software companies to store and manage their data, new Infrastructure-as-a-service (&#8220;IaaS&#8221;) companies will create financial infrastructure enabling software companies to offer financial products. With regard to Galileo&#8217;s progress, by Q3 of 2020, Galileo powered over 50M digital accounts worldwide, compared to 21M in of 2019 (almost 100% growth YoY). The growth is expected to continue to accelerate overtime. Hence, to summarize, SoFi&#8217;s decision to acquire Galileo has created an incredible moat for them within the Fintech ecosystem.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe090ca8b-c97b-4418-9df0-4e03a41eaaba_1482x703.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe090ca8b-c97b-4418-9df0-4e03a41eaaba_1482x703.png" width="584" height="277.15934065934067" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e090ca8b-c97b-4418-9df0-4e03a41eaaba_1482x703.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:691,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:584,&quot;bytes&quot;:58973,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe090ca8b-c97b-4418-9df0-4e03a41eaaba_1482x703.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe090ca8b-c97b-4418-9df0-4e03a41eaaba_1482x703.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe090ca8b-c97b-4418-9df0-4e03a41eaaba_1482x703.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe090ca8b-c97b-4418-9df0-4e03a41eaaba_1482x703.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><strong>c) Wide Brand Recognition</strong>: SoFi announced a <a href="https://www.sofi.com/press/sofi-los-angeles-chargers-team-develop-future-leaders-sofi-stadium-bolt-academy-good-good-program/">20-year partnership</a> with the Los Angeles Chargers and a stadium naming rights partner in September 2020. The partnership has given SoFi a big brand recognition among their target market of millennials. There are many millennials who enjoy using the application because of its simplicity. Recently, they also announced an initiative that enables <a href="https://www.sofi.com/press/sofi-break-barriers-offer-members-early-access-ipos/">retail investors buy stocks</a> early at the IPO.  Lastly, the whole reddit and Gamestop saga in January and February created a significant viral marketing and brand awareness for SoFi as an alternative to Robinhood <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=IPOE&amp;geo=US">as seen on Google Trends</a>. Recently within their Q4 results, the company expects to generate growth over 120% in Q1 2021. Hence, there is evidence the brand has grown substantially which bodes well for its future. We also need to recognize this is slightly trivial if the company does not retain the brand long-term.  </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b5fbbb2-b0a3-452d-b1c5-b07bac4aff3a_1068x712.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b5fbbb2-b0a3-452d-b1c5-b07bac4aff3a_1068x712.jpeg" width="458" height="305.3333333333333" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4b5fbbb2-b0a3-452d-b1c5-b07bac4aff3a_1068x712.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:712,&quot;width&quot;:1068,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:458,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;sofi stadium open&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="sofi stadium open" title="sofi stadium open" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b5fbbb2-b0a3-452d-b1c5-b07bac4aff3a_1068x712.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b5fbbb2-b0a3-452d-b1c5-b07bac4aff3a_1068x712.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b5fbbb2-b0a3-452d-b1c5-b07bac4aff3a_1068x712.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b5fbbb2-b0a3-452d-b1c5-b07bac4aff3a_1068x712.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>In summary, a bank charter together with the comprehensive platform from SoFi, the moat from Galileo platform and the millennial brand recognition will be key to SoFi&#8217;s competitive advantage within the digital banking ecosystem.</p><p></p><h4>Members &amp; <strong>Industry: </strong></h4><p>Based off industry data, the digital banking market is set to rise by 15% a year over 2019 - 2025 period and reach $16B by 2025.

Although, we recognize that digital banks have significantly less capital costs and physical presence, but its hard for investors to justify such goals and find it difficult to estimate that much growth over the next five-years without a clear rationale beyond a bank charter. </p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32601e94-01b4-4ade-978e-e2179ada472a_776x698.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32601e94-01b4-4ade-978e-e2179ada472a_776x698.png" width="304" height="273.44329896907215" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/32601e94-01b4-4ade-978e-e2179ada472a_776x698.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:698,&quot;width&quot;:776,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:304,&quot;bytes&quot;:49286,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32601e94-01b4-4ade-978e-e2179ada472a_776x698.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32601e94-01b4-4ade-978e-e2179ada472a_776x698.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32601e94-01b4-4ade-978e-e2179ada472a_776x698.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32601e94-01b4-4ade-978e-e2179ada472a_776x698.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><ul><li><p><em>Bank Charter:</em> A majority of SoFi&#8217;s financial goals are built around SoFi obtaining a bank charter as discussed. Their most recent acquisition of CPG Bank was primarily influenced because they believe it will help achieve this charter goal faster. If the regulators have a problem with SoFi or this charter fails, there will be a major price drop because the current valuation is pricing in the success of the bank charter to drive revenue and margin improvement over the long-term. </p></li><li><p><em>High competition</em>: There is significant competition around all areas of the SoFi business model. The competition range from similar investing platforms like Robinhood or Digital banking platforms like Square&#8217;s CashApp or similar players shown below.  Then, there are major competitors that are also well-established with deep pockets like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs that are significantly spending and already compete on these primary digital banking services. The key differentiation for SoFi is the comprehensiveness of the platform, Galileo&#8217;s platform, low CAC and ease of attracting millennials. It will be important to track the durability of their competitive advantage over the next 5-years. </p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6b2b1b2-275a-4752-84ed-812303053f9a_624x203.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6b2b1b2-275a-4752-84ed-812303053f9a_624x203.png" width="580" height="188.68589743589743" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d6b2b1b2-275a-4752-84ed-812303053f9a_624x203.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:203,&quot;width&quot;:624,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:580,&quot;bytes&quot;:120732,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6b2b1b2-275a-4752-84ed-812303053f9a_624x203.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6b2b1b2-275a-4752-84ed-812303053f9a_624x203.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6b2b1b2-275a-4752-84ed-812303053f9a_624x203.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6b2b1b2-275a-4752-84ed-812303053f9a_624x203.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><em>(Image: Upcoming emerging digital neo-banking platforms)</em></p><ul><li><p><em>High Short-Interest &amp; Chamath Politics:</em> I don&#8217;t like to pay a close attention to Short-sellers. However, there is a significantly high short interest. Is there something the Short sellers see? Currently, I don&#8217;t think there is anything rather than a bet that SPAC&#8217;s will lose their price value in a higher interest rate environment. I find it distracting that many people talk about Chamath&#8217;s association with the company, but I know that 5-years from now. This will not be news, so it is best to ignore it and focus on fundamentals. </p></li></ul><ul><li><p><em>Multiple business lines driving costs</em>: One of the reasons why most of the neo digital banking players shown above don&#8217;t have a fully comprehensive, banking platform that offers all forms of banking needs is due to the increasing costs overtime and oversight. There is also the risk that SoFi tries to offer too much services thereby creating a lack of focus that decreases quality overtime. Right now, it is not a risk, but it will be worth monitoring overtime.</p></li></ul><p></p><h4>Summary</h4><p>The bottom-line is that we know that digital banking represents the future of how we relate to our banks. Convenience will be key. SoFi is one of the leading players within this rapidly growing industry. They have created key competitive advantages such as a comprehensive (all-in-one) banking platform that could get bigger with the approval of a bank charter, they own Galileo&#8217;s BaaS infrastructure that is powering many new fintech platforms around the world, the company&#8217;s financials show huge acceleration and they have a growing well-recognized brand amongst millennials, all led with a top notch CEO with demonstrated success.</p><p>However, the bear case and risks include the fragmentation and steep competition posed by both existing neo-challenger banks as well as traditional banks, some unrealistic future targets that could affect valuations, the cost of managing a comprehensive platform and the sustainability of the business model.</p><p>Digital banking is here to stay and SoFi will be an interesting company to watch over the next decade.</p><p>Thank you so much for reading!

Upstart looks at the holistic person&#8217;s perspective when determining eligibility for credit loans. Individuals who don&#8217;t fit within the required scores for example, those with poor credit scores can be eligible for loans with banks using Upstart&#8217;s platform and they can price risks and create better rates for the clients.

Also, the pandemic was a major *shock* to the AI models since there had not been exposed to a recessionary environment where they had to predict consumer repayment abilities - therefore becoming better at pricing risks. Overall, Upstart has come out of the pandemic in even much better shape with regard to leveraging technology. </p><p><strong>2) Scalability, Operating &amp; Bottom Line Metrics: </strong></p><p>This is another unique feature of Upstart among the MANY fintech and tech companies.  The company remarkably grew top-line revenue at over 70% annualized WHILE - still being profitable, generate free cash flow and massively investing into Research &amp; Development and increasing sales and marketing expenses. This demonstrates efficiency.</p><p>Secondly, Contribution Profit was up - meaning [Upstart&#8217;s Revenue from fees minus (-) variable servicing costs for borrower acquisition, verification and servicing] = CP. This is an important metric to track with Upstart.  We will observe that they have been growing their contribution profit over the last 3-years. For Q4 it was up 41M and 77% YoY.  For the full year 2020, Contribution Profit was $105M, Up 115% YoY.

As automation and digitization has improved, the percentage of fraud rate for loans approved is still very low at 0.30% - good to see. I will note that they have also increased their banking partners from 10 -&gt; 15 banks utilizing Upstart&#8217;s platform. </p><p>Bottom line, the business performed well inspite of the pandemic which bodes well for 2021. Next up. </p><h3>What Investors Can Expect In 2021: Future Growth Drivers</h3><p>Based my key takeaways from the earnings call and CEO interviews:</p><p><em><strong>1) The move into Auto Loans &amp; the Acquisition of Prodigy Software: </strong></em></p><p>This will be a game changer for Upstart. More than $1-Trillion dollars worth of cars are sold and financed in North America.

The software acts as an intermediary between dealerships and car shoppers.  Consumers can refinance their loans at better rates saving around $72 per month. This also benefits the auto dealers/financial institutions behind the loans. </p><p>Regarding revenues from Prodigy, it <em><strong>will not contribute materially</strong></em> to revenue in the first half of 2021. Upstart management started this as a <em><strong>pilot year</strong></em> for Auto-loans. The program has been launched in 1 state - now expanding into 14 states. The plan is to improve and make the entire auto loan process better while gradually growing the business. Bottom line is that the acquisition should lead to = Better Affordable financing + simplified consumer experience + higher approvals for dealers which means more revenue = A win-win for all parties involved.</p><p><em><strong>2) 2021 Revenue Forecast of $500M [Growth-rate of &gt;100%+]  </strong></em></p><p>The company expects rapid revenue growth of over 100% coming into 2021 and Q1 2021 revenue of about $112M, representing a growth of over 80%. As outlined, the business was affected by the pandemic, so over a normalized growth, we will get around 70% growth YoY. This is impressive. </p><p>Equally important to note is that revenue from Prodigy has not yet been considered, but I expect this to contribute much later into Q3/Q4 2021 which should further boost growth.</p><p>Upstart expects that as the economy reopens with consumers high-saving rates, there will be more risk appetite amongst consumers to take on loans as they get more involved in the economy. </p><p>The company has stated that it is working on getting new bank partners as well as other financial institutions beyond banks to take on more loans.  CEO discussed how this is going to be the future. Upstart&#8217;s platform is developed in such a way that it flows loans through to capital markets and institutional buyers if banks are not ready and willing to fund the loans and hold them. Here&#8217;s one of the business secrets - Upstart is not entirely dependent on <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EwteJXBUUAI1VYH.png">one party within the ecosystem</a>. A strong pipeline on the funding side from institutional clients is anticipated, so I expect this to be another business driver. All these factors should lead to better growth in 2021. </p><p><em><strong>3) Banking partners swimming in Cash:</strong></em></p><p>Banks in 2020/ 2021 are swimming in a cash pool of large deposits due to the current historic 10-17% <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/economic-outlook-coronavirus-economy-stimulus-aid-savings-rate-pandemic-bofa-2021-2-1030099001">consumer savings rate in the economy</a>. Hence, in 2021 more banks are looking for more sophisticated tools to lend out cash reserves in a responsible and profitable manner.  As indicated in one of my articles, in a 2018 study, Upstart demonstrated to several large U.S. banks how the AI-based lending platform could triple approval rates while holding losses constant, compared to their current risk rating models. This is gold for banks! Upstart investors can expect increased activity in this space.  </p><p>Management indicated definitely seeing increased interest from larger banks in helping banks obtain loans from the platform. </p><p>Increased digitization of banking is helping with lesser people going into the branches. One of the issues I&#8217;ve observed with Upstart is the long sales process involved in attracting a new banking partner, but they making great progress. In the second half, they were able to onboard a few banks from start to finish, in about a 90-day process which was one of the fastest. Overall, I expect to hear more news going into the future. </p><p>4) <em><strong>Launch of Spanish language AI product:</strong></em> </p><p>The Spanish language AI lending application is one of the first of its kind among digital lending platforms in the U.S (says a lot).  Management mentioned that restaurants and retailers routinely offer Spanish language alternative but, we have not seen any with AI online lenders.  </p><p>Management mentioned they intend on targeting a different demographic &#8220;underserved&#8221; by traditional lending models. This could imply expansion within the Hispanic population within the Southern parts of the US, or expansion into financial institutions within countries in Latin America or possibly Europe.  I have a good feeling the former,  further expansion into Latin American countries might be the next expansion markets, so I expect to hear more news in 2021.</p><p><em><strong>5) Some Risks to Observe: </strong></em></p><ul><li><p><em>Impact of Stimulus checks as a risk-reward situation</em>: When more people receive significant stimulus cheques over the next couple of months, we can assume that they will have more money in their pockets which *might* lower demand for loans and credit. Although, the reward is that consumers might also take on smaller loan sizes (which is Upstart&#8217;s target market). Leading to the fact that if consumers are confident with the vaccine rollouts, people will want to spend more, travel more or dine out. They will spend more money, ultimately leading to a higher demand for loans. This makes Upstart a perfect reopening play. We&#8217;ll see how this impacts them. </p></li><li><p><em>Operating and bottom-line metrics</em>:  Management also explained that contribution margin will moderate and there will be a slightly lower net-income in early 2021. I get an impression that in 2021, the company will grow aggressively, so it will be important to monitor if that erodes some metrics on the bottom-line especially as the business normalizes in 2021. </p></li><li><p>Customer Concentration: one of the risks that we will keep monitoring is how well Upstart can diversify the customer base and increase the number of bank partners. As mentioned earlier, this should not be an issue, but something to monitor. Also, the diversification and effectiveness  of marketing campaigns and conversion rate of customers will be a risk to monitor. </p></li></ul><h3><strong>Bottom-line: </strong></h3><p>Upstart is a major disruptor using Artificial Intelligence effectively to disrupt Lending and the Fintech Ecosystem. Surprisingly, the company lacks any major competitor that significantly threatens their position. In 2021, the business is catching up to where the technology has improved to over the past year if we didn&#8217;t have Covid-19.</p><p>In summary, investors can expect growth rates of over 70-100% throughout Q1-Q4 2021 even after adjusting for the Year-over-Year effects from Covid-19, because of the move into a larger TAM for Auto loans,  the potential of increasing new banking partners/institutional partners and lastly targeting new underserved demographics. We will remain objective by monitoring the risks and operational metrics, customer concentration and approval rates.</p><p>My valuation suggests a price target of $185 by end of 2021 on $550-million in Revenue and assuming a 25x sales multiple - Why - Considering the economy reopening, strong financial health, TAM market expansion, new products and operating leverage. The price is currently overvalued but I believe there is still &#8220;<em>more gas left in the tank</em>&#8221; considering the factors outlined above.  Short-term, I expect the price to moderate to around $80-$90 for a better entry-point for new investors. </p><p>Finally, the story for Upstart is early. With no direct competitors and having captured even a 1% market-share and take rate within the existing TAM of $700B - (excluding the vast opportunities in the large credit card and home mortgage loan markets). You&#8217;ll understand why this is a company destined for a bright future over the next 3-5 years!</p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b486c8b-7e6b-437d-82de-f1391c00f9e3_626x179.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b486c8b-7e6b-437d-82de-f1391c00f9e3_626x179.png" width="626" height="179" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2b486c8b-7e6b-437d-82de-f1391c00f9e3_626x179.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:179,&quot;width&quot;:626,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:20421,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b486c8b-7e6b-437d-82de-f1391c00f9e3_626x179.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b486c8b-7e6b-437d-82de-f1391c00f9e3_626x179.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b486c8b-7e6b-437d-82de-f1391c00f9e3_626x179.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b486c8b-7e6b-437d-82de-f1391c00f9e3_626x179.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p></p><p>Thanks so much for reading.

Today, we will discuss two financial brokerage companies (The &#8216;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinhood_(company)">Robinhood</a>&#8217; of China). These two companies have demonstrated technical strength throughout this weak market period and will benefit from the current environment. They both have benefited from the rise of investing in the stock market.  I will say that I am generally skeptical about Chinese public companies, but I&#8217;ll be ignorant to believe that every Chinese company has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/06/investing-fraud-at-china-luckin-coffee-fraud-case-warning-for-investors.html">accounting issues</a>, since there are many more transparent businesses operating in China. </p><p>As promised, we will continue on the Fintech trend for the month of March. If you study history which <a href="https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/p/whats-happening-the-relationship">I&#8217;ve mentioned in multiple newsletters</a>, after a recession and bear markets, once the economy begins recovering, the US-Dollar weakens which generally bodes well for international companies/stocks. When you add a rising interest rate environment, financial companies will outperform. You&#8217;ll notice the evidence is showing below that the Non-US companies (emerging markets), financials and value are outperforming. The two companies that we are discussing today meet almost all the criteria listed below. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"

capture the massive rise in China. Both companies are backed by major institutions such as Tencent and  Samsung/Xaomi. Futu also announced recently that a&nbsp;<a href="https://ir.futuholdings.com/news-releases/news-release-details/futu-announces-agreement-purchase-shares-leading-global">leading global investment firm</a> has invested significantly into the company - all these give us more confidence that we&#8217;re investing behind giants. </p><p>FUTU and TIGR have shown exceptional product-market fit, boast of some of the best revenue sales growth in the region, best in class financial metrics (such as increasing margin profiles and operating leverage) while being guided by founder-led leadership teams and backed by major institutions around the world.</p><p></p><h3>The Industry - The Rise of Retail Investing in China: </h3><p>We are aware of the recent boom in retail investing starting from the crash of 2020. The rise in investing in the stock market has been a global event, beyond North America. China has experienced a boom in people opening brokerage accounts since the pandemic began. The emerging affluent Chinese population are taking advantage of a generational shift in wealth management. It is hard to ignore the data that China and parts of Asia will benefit from the growth in internet adoption to improve economic conditions. If we consider the fact that China has one of the largest populations on earth, we can imagine the massive investment opportunities.</p><p><a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2019/global-asset-managers-can-step-in-as-china-opens-up">BCG financial institution research</a> indicates that China&#8217;s household wealth is set to increase by about $14 trillion by 2023, reaching $35 trillion over the next couple of years, as the number of high-net-worth individuals (those with investable assets of at least $850,000) increase by 44%, driven by the opening of the Chinese economy, easing of regulations and <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2019/global-asset-managers-can-step-in-as-china-opens-up">growing overall wealth</a> as the economy pivots to a more service-based economy. </p><p>Retail investors&nbsp;in <a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-07-27/cover-story-the-losing-game-for-chinese-retail-investors-101584877.html">China have now reached 178 million</a>, around 13% of the country's population. With a population over 1.3 Billion people - think about the big addressable market. Also, consider the fact that China's middle-class is rapidly growing and becoming affluent, we can anticipate a growing interest for investing in the stock market to manage their wealth.  <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/china-investment-management-industry.html">Deloitte study</a> estimates the total addressable retail financial wealth is expected to reach US$30.2 trillion. </p><h3><strong>Company Overview:</strong></h3><h4>Futu Holdings ($FUTU): </h4><p>Futu is a technology online brokerage and wealth management platform in Hong Kong. The trading platform is known as Futu NiuNiu, through which individuals can buy and sell stocks.

Futu mostly serves the emerging affluent Chinese population who are around the age of 36.

Most importantly, customers love the Futu platform such that they are have a &lt;2% churn rate and over 98% annual client retention.

Futu has done an impressive job with attracting users and luring potential investors so that they have more than 7Million active users, similar to the Yahoo Finance brand, well known in America for getting the latest news and information. Futu is similar, but they have the opportunity to convert these users into paying clients who are actively trading.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>The factors listed above has helped Futu experience rapid growth and maintain customer loyalty, creating significant barriers to entries. </p><h3><strong>Financial Analysis &amp; Growth:</strong></h3><p>Futu's financial statements are top class and above-average within the industry.

Leaf Hua Li is the company&#8217;s founder and CEO. He was one of the earliest employees during the early days of Tencent as No 18. He left after a few years to establish Futu. Leaf owns a large stake, over 40% of Futu shares which will align his interests to that of shareholders.&nbsp;</p><p>Tencent holdings has an ownership of about 30% stake in Futu and&nbsp;has a mutually-beneficial relationship.

One of the unique things about Tiger&#8217;s stock market platform is that it is available in Hong Kong, Mainland China, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and is currently expanding into the U.S. You can also buy and sell stocks in multiple countries using the platform (almost like you are a citizen within that country) which is pretty different from what its peers offer. In general, Tiger is much more internationally focused than Futu which is predominately focused on Hong-Kong and the affluent millennials of China. </p><p>Another differentiator is that Futu has a vertically integrated trading platform built from ground-up which saves costs in the long-run. Tiger brokers utilizes a third-party software to enhance trade. </p><p>The company&#8217;s founder and CEO is Wu Tianhua. Tiger is backed by Interactive Brokers (9.5% stake) and Xiaomi (14.1% stake), the CEO currently holds over 25% stake of the company. </p><p>From the financial aspect, both companies are profitable and have expanding margins with revenue growth rates over 100% YoY. Tiger brokers is smaller in size of assets under-management and revenue figures. </p><p>See below the chart that illustrates some of the differences between the interest income generated between Futu and Tiger. While Futu&#8217;s interest income is higher, it does not necessarily make it better. It just provides context. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F514eda13-f2ab-41ac-beb4-01a190099c04_624x351.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F514eda13-f2ab-41ac-beb4-01a190099c04_624x351.png" width="450" height="253.125" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/514eda13-f2ab-41ac-beb4-01a190099c04_624x351.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:351,&quot;width&quot;:624,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:450,&quot;bytes&quot;:108143,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F514eda13-f2ab-41ac-beb4-01a190099c04_624x351.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F514eda13-f2ab-41ac-beb4-01a190099c04_624x351.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F514eda13-f2ab-41ac-beb4-01a190099c04_624x351.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F514eda13-f2ab-41ac-beb4-01a190099c04_624x351.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h4><strong>Bear Risks To Consider:</strong></h4><ul><li><p><em>Race to Zero Commissions trading</em>: Over the long term, Futu has signaled they will look into bringing down commissions. This may erode profitability and revenue growth.&nbsp;Similar to Tiger brokers. This will happen gradually, in the meantime, Futu is focused on building adjacent businesses like Wealth Management and other financial products that would make up for the revenue decline.&nbsp;However, charging lower fees will help the company by allowing more people to trade with them. The jury is out here. &nbsp;</p></li><li><p><em>The Covid effects</em>: There are always discussions about what happens post-pandemic when lockdowns are largely over.  Asia has managed the pandemic better and trading volumes for both companies have actually increased. Long-term, people will be more interested in increasing their wealth, which should allow for sustained volumes.</p></li><li><p><em>Chinese Government &amp; Geopolitics</em>: China's government plays a large role in regulating industrial development. Additionally, China's banks are state owned and heavily regulated. It will be something to consider if changes in accounting rules or geopolitics between the US &amp; China affects both company&#8217;s stock prices. </p></li><li><p>Tiger Brokers has had issues with the New Zealand government because of the lack of due diligence when attracting new customers to the platform; attributed  to aggressive growth practices. This is something to pay attention towards, but it doesn&#8217;t appear to be a major issue right now. </p></li><li><p><em>Competition</em>: There is intense competition with other financial institutions in Asia that offer similar brokerage investing services such as WeBull and&nbsp;eToro. This is important to track, but so far, based upon the differentiating factors outlined above, Futu and Tiger brokers have the potential to become dominant players in Asia. </p></li></ul><h4><strong>Overall Business Summary &amp; Differences:</strong></h4><p>Below is recap and summary of Futu and Tiger Brokers.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8665831f-0720-4b9d-a2f9-f52d238fc9b8_645x612.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8665831f-0720-4b9d-a2f9-f52d238fc9b8_645x612.png" width="589" height="558.8651162790698" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8665831f-0720-4b9d-a2f9-f52d238fc9b8_645x612.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:612,&quot;width&quot;:645,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:589,&quot;bytes&quot;:56059,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8665831f-0720-4b9d-a2f9-f52d238fc9b8_645x612.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8665831f-0720-4b9d-a2f9-f52d238fc9b8_645x612.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8665831f-0720-4b9d-a2f9-f52d238fc9b8_645x612.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8665831f-0720-4b9d-a2f9-f52d238fc9b8_645x612.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h4><strong>Bottom-Line</strong></h4><p>The majority of the Chinese population are rapidly moving from a lower-income class into the middle class/upper class as a result of a stronger economy. This means more wealth in the hands of Chinese citizens.&nbsp;More people have experienced the benefits from investing in the stock market, after this experience, I don&#8217;t believe things will go back to normal. Asia is a less mature market with more opportunities for growth. According to Credit Suisse&#8217;s <em><a href="https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/reports-research/global-wealth-report.html">Global Wealth Report</a>,</em>&nbsp;China is now home to the second largest amount of aggregate household wealth in the world (after the United States).</p><p>I have provided an analysis of both companies. Futu and Tiger brokers are good companies with the potential to become the leading brokerage firms in China and Asia. Based on my research, I will slightly pick Futu over Tigers brokers as the current &#8216;Robinhood&#8217; of China, but I believe both companies will perform well. The two companies have both shown strategic execution by rapidly increasing platform user base, focusing on user experience, boasting best-in-class financial metrics within the financial industry. Both are expanding into newer lines of business which should propel future growth. Both will be fascinating to watch over the next couple of years! </p><p>Thank you for reading and have a great weekend! </p><p></p><p><em>Let me know your thoughts</em></p><p><em><a href="https://ir.futuholdings.com/news-events/news-releases">Source: Futu Investor Relations</a> </em></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/p/futu-vs-tiger-brokers-who-is-the/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/p/futu-vs-tiger-brokers-who-is-the/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p><em><strong>Disclaimer</strong></em></p><p><em>Please note that this article does not constitute investment advice in any form.

I had prepared a research report on a good international stock, but due to the market action, I suspect many people are probably not in the frame of mind to read the report, so we&#8217;ll get back to reports next week.</p><p>In this article, I would like to explain the phenomenon that occurred this week as I am aware that a number of new investors are trying to understand the current market dynamics.  While we do not want to focus too much on macro-economics more than business fundamentals. it is important to be aware of the general market condition and understand how different assets work. The conversation around interest rates vs technology will continue for the rest of 2021. This is because if a company delivers superior results but the macro environment is against them, it doesn&#8217;t matter. I thought I would use some of my Economics background to share some highlights of what is happening in the market in a simplified manner. </p><h4><strong>Overview of Today&#8217;s Report: </strong></h4><ol><li><p>Basics: The Competition between Stocks and Bonds</p></li><li><p>Different Business Cycles: It is now net</p></li><li><p>Divergence between Technology Growth and Value </p></li><li><p>2020 vs 2021 Technology Markets: Implications going forward.</p></li></ol><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h4><strong>Basics:</strong></h4><p>First, I really want people to know that institutions (Pension funds, Banks, Wealth Management etc.) control about <strong>70-80%</strong> of the stock market.

Most company earnings and profits were accelerating for digital companies. As a result, investors figured out that tech companies are relatively safe havens, so we experienced the rise in the assets for digital and innovative company stocks (plus Govt bond yields were low because of demand &amp; lower interest rates).</p><p><strong>3) Recovery/Early Business Cycle Phase: </strong>The next phase of the cycle is recovery. This started happening after the vaccines were announced towards the end of 2020. Investors assumed that since we had a Covid19 solution plus the enormous amount of Government stimulus, we will be rapidly recovering from a recession. The expectation was that corporate earnings will begin growing and consumer spending will pick-up. During this stage over <strong>&#8220;history&#8221;</strong>, institutional investors switch to Consumer cyclicals (Like Energy, Industrials, Consumer Discretionary stocks) and Financials are owned. <strong>Interest rate yields begin to rise</strong> like <strong>today</strong> due to the anticipation that things are going to get better. Investors sell bonds (yields go up). This development reduces technology stocks with high-valuations since there is growth in the economy. Analysis is based on historical data, so we should not be surprised this is happening today. </p><p><strong>4) Mid-Late Business Phase:</strong>&nbsp;This is typically the longest phase of the business cycle. The economy is stronger, but growth is moderating. Over these long-term periods, the best stocks that perform with relatively low rates are the technology stocks that are growing rapidly. Included are industrials and basic materials.</p><p>---</p><h4><strong>Why Technology Outperformed In 2020:</strong></h4><p>During the panicky phase of 2020, the yield return on a Gov&#8217;t bonds were down as shown below. This created a situation known as Negative real yields (Low Bonds after substracting Inflation), allowing institutions to pay up and buy highly valued technology and innovative stocks, thus leading to a wide gap in valuations as seen below.  Currently, in early 2021, the average return you could get from a 10-year bond yield is equivalent to the return of an average stock on the markets (S&amp;P 500). <strong>Once this conflict occurs, there will always be a challenge and that&#8217;s what happened over the last couple of weeks</strong> since institutions can reduce their exposure to stocks and put some money into yields.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b6e9270-d11d-4f56-9f77-748e9a0eb112_460x233.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b6e9270-d11d-4f56-9f77-748e9a0eb112_460x233.png" width="460" height="233" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4b6e9270-d11d-4f56-9f77-748e9a0eb112_460x233.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:233,&quot;width&quot;:460,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:87657,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b6e9270-d11d-4f56-9f77-748e9a0eb112_460x233.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b6e9270-d11d-4f56-9f77-748e9a0eb112_460x233.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b6e9270-d11d-4f56-9f77-748e9a0eb112_460x233.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b6e9270-d11d-4f56-9f77-748e9a0eb112_460x233.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Due to high levels of optimism and high valuations in 2020 -

The stock market will do great over the next couple of years. Value and Growth need to come together to make it happen.  Technology and innovation stocks will do <strong>okay </strong>in 2021 <strong>- </strong>but because the economy is recovering, value stocks will outperform them. However, long-term, innovation wins!</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Mean reversion means the rotation will continue - money will be flowing out from Software Technology into Cyclical Technology stocks like Semi-conductors,  International stocks, Financials, Industrials, and Energy, but not everything will come out because we are experiencing a massive digital transformation in technology. </p></li><li><p>Focus on researching and finding the very best technology stocks that will perform well in this environment i.e. only companies that have strong fundamentals. Don&#8217;t buy from companies based on &#8220;Hope for the future.&#8221;  The market will scrutinize against stocks that do not have sound fundamentals and you&#8217;ve seen it. At Investi Analyst, this is our goal.  </p></li><li><p>Last evidence that this is a bull market is because Historical Risky Assets linked closely to the re-opening of the economy/early business cycles are performing well today compared to March 2020; Emerging Markets, Copper, Small Caps, Financials, Dow Transport, Consumer discretionary and Corporate Junk bonds etc are outperforming. This is a bullish signal. Overall the market is doing great. </p><p></p></li></ul><h4><strong>Bottom-Line:</strong></h4><p>My plan is to explain to my subscribers the data and information to help you understand market dynamics and make an informed decision. Everyone has different goals, risk appetites and investment horizons. Rates may be rising now off their lows, but they'll stop rising soon, and settle down at levels much below their historically average levels. Tech will normalize again, maybe not to the extent that we saw in 2020. If you are a long-term investor who doesn&#8217;t need your money anytime soon in 2021, be very patient. I expect tech outperformance by late 2021/into 2022. If your preference is for value stocks, pick wisely as well and you will do well. </p><p>Always remember, investing is for the long-term. The faster you want to make money, the faster you&#8217;ll lose it and vice-versa. I will encourage a bit of diversification of a portfolio but everyone has different methodology to approaching markets and what they want in a portfolio. Next week, we will get back to company reports and start identifying good brands to consider investing in.</p><p></p><p>Thanks for reading and have a good weekend. </p><p></p><p><em>Your Thoughts: What do you think about the markets? </em></p><p><em>Most Sources from Bloomberg, AllStar Charts and Investor Place</em></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/p/whats-happening-the-relationship/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/p/whats-happening-the-relationship/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p>Don&#8217;t forget to subscribe to receive weekly updates and reviews:</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/p/whats-happening-the-relationship?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/p/whats-happening-the-relationship?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[February 2021: Top Performers, Best Earnings Recap & My Picks Into March]]></title><description><![CDATA[Earnings Report]]></description><link>https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/p/february-2021-top-performers-best</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/p/february-2021-top-performers-best</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Francis]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 27 Feb 2021 14:00:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48850957-1f17-421d-a108-2d63dfd2c657_865x459.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good Morning Everyone, </p><p>It was a fascinating week for the markets and technology companies. </p><p>Welcome if you are a new subscriber!

Volatility &amp; Market Data:</h3><p>The volatility experienced this week was healthy. Stocks don&#8217;t move on a straight line-up. Market movements are healthy, however, the challenge is the severe impact on technology stocks. </p><p>Essentially, yields are going up because bond holders forecast robust economic growth in 2021, anticipated inflation due to the additional monetary stimulus and lastly, the market anticipates an interest rate hike could be much closer than previously expected.  </p><p>Historically, bond yields are at an all-time low. It is likely they will keep rising in the near-term.  Rising yields put selling pressure on highly-valued tech stocks. Historically, if we recall when rates were rising in the second half of 2012, throughout 2013, 2016 and 2018, technology growth stocks were underperforming. The same reoccurred in 2004, 2005 and 2006. In this environment, value always outperforms and Financial firms gain. Growth investors may need to ask tough questions. </p><p>Bottom-line, we are in a new bull market due to the economic growth expected later in 2021. The reason I am confident is the health of the markets are fine. The <strong>cheat code</strong> to know this is to evaluate the defensive assets on the market because they are usually bid up during times of fear; they include the Vix, Credit Spreads, US Dollar, Bonds/Treasuries (TLT), Consumer staples and Utilities. In January of 2020 before the big crash, all these asset classes were in the opposite direction predicting a crash was pending. Today, they are the opposite. None of them are showing any signs of weakness or extreme fear, so we are fine. Its a rotation :) </p><p></p><h3><strong>2.

The future is still bright for this name. The negative drop in earnings below was around their billings expenses, which is one-time event. </p></li><li><p><strong>Etsy </strong>(&#9989; 8%): Reported one of the best results! I am confident this company will be higher over the next couple of months.

Despite of the sell-off, most institutions and shareholders decided not to sell which bodes well for March.  </p><h4>Middle Ground: (News/Update)</h4><ul><li><p><strong>Cheggs (&#9989; 5%)</strong>: Phenomenal results.

The stock was affected by the IPO lock-up expiry where past shareholders sold shares and the tech-sell-offs. This is a short-term issue and I&#8217;ve been buying more shares all week because I expect a rebound. My past analysis of the <a href="https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/p/palantir-technologies-americas-most">company</a>. </p></li><li><p><strong>Cloudfare</strong> (&#128315; -16%) Good results. They got caught in the sell-off due to their high valuation. Sequential customer addition is impressive from 5000 customers to over 10,000 new customers in a quarter. Valuation is the concern here.  </p></li><li><p><strong>Fastly (&#128315;-28%): </strong> The results were decent. However, the company is experiencing a slow-down in customer growth at the expense of Cloudfare. This is a *yellow signal* but I&#8217;m willing to watch Q2 before making a final decision. </p></li><li><p><strong>Peloton</strong> (&#128315;-30%): Good results, with slightly &#8220;okay&#8221; guidance. Peloton also got caught in the technology sell-off due to valuations. </p></li></ul><p>Most of these setbacks are temporal pull-backs for long-term investors. </p><p>The chart below shows some of February earnings report by revenue growth, but always remember the <em><strong>% beat above estimates</strong></em> is one of the ways to truly measure the quality of an earnings report and 9/10 times predicts how the stock will perform over the coming months before the next Quarter.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f41bdf-6b5c-40dc-8e60-454e0277c8ad_908x467.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f41bdf-6b5c-40dc-8e60-454e0277c8ad_908x467.png" width="908" height="467" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/88f41bdf-6b5c-40dc-8e60-454e0277c8ad_908x467.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:467,&quot;width&quot;:908,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:92609,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f41bdf-6b5c-40dc-8e60-454e0277c8ad_908x467.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f41bdf-6b5c-40dc-8e60-454e0277c8ad_908x467.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f41bdf-6b5c-40dc-8e60-454e0277c8ad_908x467.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88f41bdf-6b5c-40dc-8e60-454e0277c8ad_908x467.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h4><strong>OUT - Excluded from Investi Top-30: </strong></h4><ul><li><p><strong>Overstock </strong>(-16%): Reported good results as seen above. However, the reason I will be removing them from the list is because of the weaker future revenue growth guidance and there are aspects of the business that are weak.   </p></li><li><p><strong>Nautilus, Inc</strong> (-31%): Company reported decent results. Weak future revenue guidance suggests the business will experience a slowdown in 2021 and the business only got a &#8220;Covid&#8221; boost from at-home-fitness. If things change in Q2, I&#8217;ll keep you all updated.</p></li></ul><h4>NEW - Addition into Investi Top-30: </h4><p>These companies are very well managed, delivered excellent results, shown great execution and traction. I will share more information later in the month as I don;t need to go into details now.</p><ul><li><p><strong>ZoomInfo Technology</strong>: Great company with invaluable moats for B2B marketing and positive product reviews. Founder-Led, growing revenues over 50% YoY, profitable and posted positive future growth for 2021.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Upwork Inc</strong>: The freelance company is experiencing massive tailwinds from the Gig economy. The company has been increasing revenue on a sequential basis. This is a big bet on their CEO who was appointed in 2020 - She is a past McKinsey and Microsoft executive and many key product related experiences. Since her arrival, her transformation over the company in the last one year is evident in their growth. More details in the months ahead.</p></li></ul><p>I am confident both companies will outperform in expectations due to their robust revenue growth. I will share more information in March.</p><h3>3. Some of February&#8217;s Best Earnings Report (Positive Catalyst for March): </h3><p>As mentioned earlier, one of the <em><strong>biggest</strong> </em>and <em><strong>important </strong></em>lessons I have learned about <strong>stock </strong><em><strong>performance</strong> </em>after a quarterly earnings report is to not observe the year-over-year growth rates, but you want to track the future revenue guidance estimates, the % of earnings beat that was above the analyst consensus estimates and track *positive surprises* from the report that was not previously priced in. Over and over, these factors ideally provide an insight into the stock&#8217;s performance for the next 3-4 months before the next report (barring any new information). </p><p>I am sharing this list as an incentive for being subscribers.  Based upon data analysis, my best bets to outperform in March &amp; April based on Earnings, Positive Guidance and Technical indicators are the companies listed below. I am most confident about APPS, ETSY, ZI, UPWK and MWK. The chart shows the companies with some of the best earning surprises in Q4 2020 that are not within the Investi Top-30 list.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f637f87-570c-4ccc-8170-5ef20b260bb6_889x589.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f637f87-570c-4ccc-8170-5ef20b260bb6_889x589.png" width="648" height="429.3273340832396" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5f637f87-570c-4ccc-8170-5ef20b260bb6_889x589.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:589,&quot;width&quot;:889,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:648,&quot;bytes&quot;:44796,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f637f87-570c-4ccc-8170-5ef20b260bb6_889x589.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f637f87-570c-4ccc-8170-5ef20b260bb6_889x589.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f637f87-570c-4ccc-8170-5ef20b260bb6_889x589.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f637f87-570c-4ccc-8170-5ef20b260bb6_889x589.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p></p><h4>Recap of Investi Analyst - My February Research:  </h4><p>This is a recap of some of my research and analysis work in February incase you are interested.</p><ul><li><p>Seeking Alpha (I became a contributing analyst recently where I provide long-form fundamental research and writing).

There is no doubt that Gotham, Palantir's government software business is important as it generates the core of the business revenues, however, I believe investors of&nbsp; Palantir should focus on the&nbsp;vast potential that exists within the commercial business. I expect the potential from Foundry to generate the bulk of future growth over the next few years.&nbsp;</p><p>This article focuses on looking at the foundational elements and tenets of Foundry, the wide ranging use cases for the software and key takeaways from recent presentations for investors to expect moving forward.

Their software analyzes vast amount of dataset from disparate locations, decoding and making sense of trends so organizations can make better decisions. At the core for Palantir is that Foundry is used for analysis of vast amounts of data so as to give insight and drive business decisions.</p><p>The fundamental elements to how Palantir Technology products are structured into the following (think about it as a funnel) - It begins:</p><ul><li><p><em>Data Integration</em> &#8211; It starts with the foundation of the software, which is its ability to combine every form of structured and unstructured data hidden across various systems and departments of an organization.</p></li><li><p><em>Knowledge management</em> &#8211; second, the software ensures that millions of dataset are captured, classified and codified into digital artefacts, making collective organizational knowledge accessible and organized into detailed levels so the user knows - the source, the who, the what and why etc.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><em>Search &amp; Discovery</em> &#8211; third, the software then ensures all of that integration of data and information can be easily found and discovered across an organization and the user can conduct analysis to drive effective decisions&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><em>Collaboration</em> &#8211; lastly, enabling the information to be accessible and shared by the appropriate users through enhanced visualization and a variety of means to enhance collaboration within an organization.</p></li></ul><p>These are easily the best ways to understand and expand Palantir's software. If you want to learn about this structure I defined, I encourage listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LhgBpL1iN0&amp;t=438s&amp;ab_channel=TheInvestingOpportunity">this video</a> from Palantir's employee.</p><h2>The Four Tenets of Foundry</h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15256c59-5f80-41d1-bb44-e0e97217a38b_640x360.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15256c59-5f80-41d1-bb44-e0e97217a38b_640x360.png" width="640" height="360" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/15256c59-5f80-41d1-bb44-e0e97217a38b_640x360.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:360,&quot;width&quot;:640,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15256c59-5f80-41d1-bb44-e0e97217a38b_640x360.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15256c59-5f80-41d1-bb44-e0e97217a38b_640x360.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15256c59-5f80-41d1-bb44-e0e97217a38b_640x360.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15256c59-5f80-41d1-bb44-e0e97217a38b_640x360.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>(<em>Source: <a href="https://investors.palantir.com/events/event-details/2021/Live-Demo-Day/default.aspx">Palantir Demo day</a></em>)</p><p>At the core, Foundry is a data integration and management software with comprehensive tools and capabilities to automate complex dataset for simple business decision-making. It is utilized by commercial organizations to create a central operating system for their data. Most of these tenets are key takeaways from Foundry's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgj6FYghPh8&amp;ab_channel=BeyondourMoney">Demo-day</a>:</p><ul><li><p><em>Ontology for Collaboration:</em>This Ontology of information, we can think of it as a foundational data component - essentially like a dictionary or an ocean of data, concepts and subject domains of all sorts for an organization. From this ocean, you can build or take what you need for analytics or future modelling. Foundry's ontology capabilities has been improved to allow for a central data source which allows for increased collaboration across an organization or multiple industry use-cases. Additionally from this ocean, the software also enhances advanced search capabilities and no-code configuration to enable easy access to information and reporting capabilities for all types of users.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><em>Infused Advanced AI &amp; Simulations Capabilities: </em>Once you have a deep ontology of data, the next thing is to use this information for decision-making. Foundry is unique in that it has everything you need for Data Science and modelling libraries. Foundry has the advanced AI capabilities of answering difficult simulation questions of &#8220;What If statements&#8221; &#8211; users having the ability to run models easily to understand the outcomes of their decisions especially if these situations are completely brand new or there is a lack of past data (this is where Foundry shines). Also, the software is extremely adaptable as new information changes in real-time. This is one of the reasons why this software is used in high-pressure environments like the US Army. The simulation capabilities is a promising feature for businesses.</p></li><li><p><em>Modularity of Foundry</em>: Modularity in the sense that a system's components and its design are made so flexible so it can be separated into functional independent parts or reconstructed often to match different software needs. You can take a piece of their software and use it as needed. This word was repeated more times than any during Demo day. The focus for Palantir is that foundry can be flexible and adaptable based on the needs of an organization. This makes foundry's software agnostic. At the heart is that the client can use Foundry to take what they need and build analytics based off their preferences (small or large).</p></li><li><p><em>Interoperability leading to scale and future mobile offerings: </em>The last element that Palantir has focused upon is the interoperability with other applications and software from databases to other digital platforms. This is important for the scalability because it is essential that Palantir systems can &#8216;talk&#8217; or 'communicate' easily with any organizations systems. This interoperability will be leading to their mobile offering which will be key for collecting and sharing data in various forms. The interoperability features with a 3rd party data's platform discussed at the Demo day, we now know was the IBM Cloud Pak System *surprise* but there will be many more other examples of how their software can be integrated with other systems in the future.</p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8615ea39-b2e7-481b-91ba-ba9b7ca9c67b_487x392.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8615ea39-b2e7-481b-91ba-ba9b7ca9c67b_487x392.png" width="487" height="392" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8615ea39-b2e7-481b-91ba-ba9b7ca9c67b_487x392.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:392,&quot;width&quot;:487,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8615ea39-b2e7-481b-91ba-ba9b7ca9c67b_487x392.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8615ea39-b2e7-481b-91ba-ba9b7ca9c67b_487x392.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8615ea39-b2e7-481b-91ba-ba9b7ca9c67b_487x392.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8615ea39-b2e7-481b-91ba-ba9b7ca9c67b_487x392.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>(<em>Source: <a href="https://investors.palantir.com/events/event-details/2021/Live-Demo-Day/default.aspx">Palantir Demo day</a></em>)</p><h2><strong>Industry Wide Use Cases</strong></h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdbf754b-a413-4ac1-bb67-e9660d8d1175_640x308.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdbf754b-a413-4ac1-bb67-e9660d8d1175_640x308.png" width="640" height="308" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cdbf754b-a413-4ac1-bb67-e9660d8d1175_640x308.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:308,&quot;width&quot;:640,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdbf754b-a413-4ac1-bb67-e9660d8d1175_640x308.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdbf754b-a413-4ac1-bb67-e9660d8d1175_640x308.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdbf754b-a413-4ac1-bb67-e9660d8d1175_640x308.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdbf754b-a413-4ac1-bb67-e9660d8d1175_640x308.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>(<em>Source: <a href="https://investors.palantir.com/events/event-details/2021/Live-Demo-Day/default.aspx">Palantir Demo day</a></em>)</p><p>The most exciting aspect for the future of Palantir is the wide optionality and extensive use cases for the software across so many industries.&nbsp;

Some sectors already using the software include: Material handling and Transportation; Manufacturing; Automotive and airplane manufacturers; Airlines partnership; Oil &amp; Gas and Renewable sectors etc.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Services sectors:</em> Across these sectors, the similarity I found is that they are improving decision-making by minimizing risks and improving risk management based on data, increasing automation of manual and labour- oriented processes, using AI to better help customize and personalize tailored customer solutions, helping with due diligence, advanced analytics tools for developing of news drugs as seen with their software used extensively by the FDA &amp; NHS England to improve drug developments and tracking of Covid-19. All the existing sectors currently using the software include: Management consulting; Law firms; Insurance; System integrators; Financial institutions and banking; Healthcare and Pharmaceutical industries.</p><p>I have named over 16+ industries that are using Palantir's Foundry software. Since Foundry's launch, they have helped client realize almost $500M in cost reductions, synergies and business outcomes with many more in the future.</p><h2><strong>Competitive Edge That Makes Foundry Unique</strong></h2><p><em>Integration power:</em> The ability to absorb different types of data and the broad data integration capabilities with multiple applications or systems such Windows SQL, iOS, to reduce the manual/human labour to gather such data is huge. This is one of the hardest aspect of analytics and the team has focused on building their capabilities here. The ability to integrate with disparate data sources (both structured and unstructured) to extract, make connections to drive modelling and better decision making.</p><p><em>The modularity and interoperability: </em>Building on the integration piece is the ability of their software to mold to any underlying infrastructure or software regardless of organizational size or IT database. Foundry can be customized to fit new user needs beyond its past capabilities of only fitting to govt systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, Foundry is cloud agnostic regardless of it the company is on the edge or uses either public, private or hybrid cloud platform.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Full-stack analytics software</em>: Palantir's software is mostly vertically integrated from the foundational elements of analytics data-gathering all the way up to the advanced modelling and visualization for the user level.&nbsp;</p><p><em>The intuitiveness and ease of use</em>: The user interface level of the software is incredibly easy to use and applicable for both technical and non-technical users. It has so many drag and drop features, you'll realize this from the Demo. Most of the industry&#8217;s software caters to either groups of users and makes it easily adoptable.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't want to go into a full in-depth analysis again as if you combine the Foundational and the four tenets to this competitive advantages, you will find the key differentiators for Palantir. If you want more information on another aspect of their advanced competitive advantages, read more of&nbsp;<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4398322-palantir-parallels-microsoft-potential-network-effects-underappreciated">Seeking Alpha analysis on the parallels with Microsoft.</a></p><h2><strong>Financials &amp; Execution Of Foundry So far</strong></h2><p>Below, I will highlight some key takeaways from the Commercial part of the business based the <a href="https://s26.q4cdn.com/381064750/files/doc_presentations/2021/Q4-2020-Business-Update.pdf">recent Q4-Earnings report</a> and call.&nbsp;</p><p>As you know already, Palantir&#8217;s 2020 Revenue was $1.093B of which 56% came from Government and 44% from Commercial clients. This revenue mix has improved from previous years by over 10%. Commercial grew by 22% Growth YoY to make up $482M. In general, this sector experienced a slow-down in 2020, as we saw 4% growth YoY in the quarter.&nbsp; hey have signed lots of new commercial clients (over 21+) that were NOT RECOGNIZED YET within the revenue for the full year of 2020 (This is what also made Q4-2020 revenue look weaker than expected).&nbsp; Its important to note that RPO is a key metric left out of the headlines from Q4. RPO are the Remaining performance obligations (RPO), which represents the non-cancelable contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized. Hence, we can expect more in the future. &nbsp;</p><p>The US part of the business is growing the fastest as they saw 107% YoY revenue growth from US Commercial customers. This signals&nbsp;that the international commercial sector for the business is still largely untapped and through IBM's sales team that exist in 180+ countries, expect to hear more.&nbsp;</p><p>Palantir's Customers: They finished the year recognizing a total of 125+ customers. Although, Top 20 concentration risk is decreasing by (6% YoY), those heavy weight still provide a bulk of the revenue for the company. Also, Palantir is increasing the revenue they get from existing customers from $495M in 2019 to $663M in 2020 while the average revenue per customer increased by 41% YoY to around $8M. This is a good signal overall as it means existing customers enjoy the software, are upgrading and they are successfully upselling. This is important because they do not always need to attract new customers to keep up revenue stable in the future. Overtime, I believe the customer concentration risk will reduce. Also note that the contract sizes and deals are getting bigger.&nbsp;</p><p>Contribution margins are important for Palantir - It is a measure of their efficiency in selling and delivering software to customers. For the FY 2020, this number improved massively from 21% CM &#224; 54% CM in 2020. This means they are improving the way they approach customers especially utilizing software like Apollo. There are more automatic set-ups when setting up new clients and improvement in the number of deployments necessary. This is something they focused upon in recent year years and is important for scale.</p><h2>Risks To Consider</h2><p>We have to also to be cautions and consider some key risks:&nbsp;</p><p><em>Palantir's management has a lot of execution to prove</em> with Foundry with regards to product market fit and their ability to acquire new commercial clients. We know that have started building the seeds. Also, the reputation for the reliability of Palantir's software within the US Government and military is enough credibility to attract new enterprise customers.</p><p><em>Brewing Competition</em> within the Advanced Analytics sector is hot, most especially within the Commercial sector. However, I believe that competitors such as (<a href="http://c3.ai">C3.ai)</a>&nbsp;and (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPLK">SPLK</a>) address different niches in analytics. They also do not have a full-stack layer and the advanced analytical integration capabilities of Foundry's.&nbsp;I have also outlined all the reasons I believe makes Palantir unique above that most competitors cannot match.</p><p><em>They have a small margin for error</em> with customers due to the current customer concentration of the Top-20 clients. Moving forward, with the IBM partnership and expansion into the private sector, I see this customer risk reducing overtime and being minimized as they capture new customers.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Refusal to adopt Palantir&#8217;s software and longer sales cycles</em>: Due to the fact that the company has spent most of its years within Government sector. They may lack some experience, market-fit or not enough credibility to make their software appeal to commercial clients (relative to competitors who are strictly providers of analytical tools to private companies who already have a core competency here). They may encounter clients whose systems cannot not 'talk' with Foundry or clients with archaic systems. Palantir has realized this problem which is why on Demo day, they emphasized the interoperability and modularity of the software, it appears they have been working on this issue. However, as I mentioned, with the new launch and updates to Foundry, I see this challenge reducing overtime.</p><h3>Going forward &#8211; Future growth expectations</h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5ff79f2-091f-4e92-b1d0-74637f78b261_323x301.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5ff79f2-091f-4e92-b1d0-74637f78b261_323x301.png" width="323" height="301" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a5ff79f2-091f-4e92-b1d0-74637f78b261_323x301.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:301,&quot;width&quot;:323,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5ff79f2-091f-4e92-b1d0-74637f78b261_323x301.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5ff79f2-091f-4e92-b1d0-74637f78b261_323x301.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5ff79f2-091f-4e92-b1d0-74637f78b261_323x301.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5ff79f2-091f-4e92-b1d0-74637f78b261_323x301.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>(<em>Source: Palantir Demo day</em>)</p><p><em><a href="https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2021/IBM-and-Palantir-Partner-to-Help-Businesses-Easily-Deploy-Powerful-and-Open-AI-Applications-Unlock-Valuable-Data-Across-Hybrid-Cloud-Environments/default.aspx">Palantir and IBM Partnership:</a></em> This partnership will be massive for the future of Foundry. They are partnering to help businesses easily deploy powerful AI applications to unlock business value.&nbsp; Expect more as Foundry 2021 updates merges with a giant IBM Cloud Pak for Data. They will benefit from the scaling of IBM&#8217;s 2,500-person sales force across multiple countries. Also, don&#8217;t forget that Palantir since it was founded in 2003 has not had a sales team until 2018/19. Hence this bump will further drive down the Customer acquisition costs by reducing sales cycles and kick-in Foundry's potential. If you want more on the software's capabilities,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/palantir-cloud-pak-for-data">read about the partnership</a> from IBM.</p><p><em>Opportunity for Commercial expansion with international organizations:</em> This is another exciting part of the future is not only their 100% growth amongst US corporations but, the growth to expect from more international partners using IBM's international presence.</p><p></p><h3><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h3><p>I strongly believe that in 2020, Palantir was primarily focused on <a href="https://www.palantir.com/covid19/?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link">helping Covid clients such as the world's national governments</a> since Covid came as a surprise. They could not focus too much on the commercial side and also consider that many businesses were not spending aggressively until businesses got clarity on the future. This is why later into the year including the IPO, we heard lots of the new agreements and sign-ups in Q4-2020.</p><p>Secondly, there were lots of revenue that <a href="https://s26.q4cdn.com/381064750/files/doc_presentations/2021/Q4-2020-Business-Update.pdf">will be recognized</a> going forward based off many of those partnerships meaning this fourth quarter is a bit deceptive. For management to guide to $4B of revenue until fiscal 2025 signals great confident on the future based behind-the-scenes discussions. Most especially with a growing backlog of $2.8B in deal value, the likelihood of achieving these goals are fully possible considering they could sign such an amount in just one quarter.&nbsp;Moving forward, the strategy for Palantir will be the ability to sell to smaller and medium-sized customers and attract 'smaller' deals with short sales cycles such as the way Snowflake (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SNOW">SNOW</a>) scales.&nbsp;</p><p>Third, the best part of Foundry (and <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4406413-palantir-technologies-pltr-alex-karp-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript">management really emphasized</a>) is that we will see more from the commercial since they are less than &lt;5% penetrated of the top corporations of the world. Don't forget, this is a 'relatively' new side of the business that they only started focusing upon in recent years, hence they are just beginning.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8cb35a3a-f6dd-4261-8e9d-4f460300d6f3_640x389.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8cb35a3a-f6dd-4261-8e9d-4f460300d6f3_640x389.png" width="640" height="389" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8cb35a3a-f6dd-4261-8e9d-4f460300d6f3_640x389.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:389,&quot;width&quot;:640,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8cb35a3a-f6dd-4261-8e9d-4f460300d6f3_640x389.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8cb35a3a-f6dd-4261-8e9d-4f460300d6f3_640x389.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8cb35a3a-f6dd-4261-8e9d-4f460300d6f3_640x389.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8cb35a3a-f6dd-4261-8e9d-4f460300d6f3_640x389.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>(<em>Source: Palantir Investor Relations</em>)</p><p>Finally,&nbsp;I have analyzed and provided all the competitive advantages that distinguishes Foundry from the current market competition within the Advanced Analytics and AI Sector.

They surprised with a decent earnings report on Thursday afternoon, so I decided it was important to share this company with all subscribers and pause my writing on my previous company. I wanted this one because I believe this is the most <em>undervalued </em>and <em>mispriced </em>name on the market based off their future potential. </p><p>This is a special company for me. It was the first company I ever put up on this newsletter from 2020 as I&#8217;ve followed them for very long.  Personal disclosure, It become my biggest portfolio holding as I have never been more bullish (Similar to my high bullish conviction on $APPS, $PLTR, $CRWD, $ETSY). I look forward to being proven wronged. Later this week, my 4000+ page full research report on 2U will be published on <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/author/investi-analyst#regular_articles">Seeking Alpha</a>. In this newsletter, I have &#8216;tried&#8217; my best to shorten the research to show my thesis. </p><p></p><p><strong>High-level Summary: </strong></p><ul><li><p>2U is the industry leader emerging to capture the multi-billion dollar education technology market that is only &lt;4% digitized.  </p></li><li><p>2U's Competitive dynamics are getting stronger with the pandemic while recognizing all the risks are baked into the current price which I evaluate.  </p></li><li><p>2U is the most undervalued and mispriced tech stock meaning you&#8217;re getting a ridiculous value at its current prices.

This is a bonus fact, not a core thesis. An observation that&#8217;s important to note before you begin reading. </p><p></p></li></ul><p><strong>Investment Thesis Summary:</strong></p><p>2U (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TWOU">TWOU</a>) is a leading online education technology company with the competitive dynamics that positions them to dominate the education industry experiencing digital transformation. The company has deep partnerships with the world's leading institutions such as the Top Ivy league schools in the US from Harvard to the University&nbsp;of Cambridge in Europe and many more. 2U has consistently been growing revenues compounding over a 40% growth rate over the last 3-years since their inception with above average gross-margins over 70%.&nbsp;</p><p>The current tailwind of Online Education is here to stay after Covid, hence, I believe that 2U will emerge as one of the biggest beneficiaries of this trend.</p><p>My article seeks to justify this thesis by providing a company overview, competitive positioning, student growth analysis and the multi-trillion dollar market opportunity for them. Afterwards, I evaluate 2U Competitive advantages and industry moat that differentiates them from the competition, I give a full financial analysis with my rationale for a $100 PT valuation, I analyze the risks, competition and lastly, a final summary of what to expect from 2U in 2021 based off their recent earnings call.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fd2b4b6-5493-42d2-b66a-76b4dcf280e8_417x417.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fd2b4b6-5493-42d2-b66a-76b4dcf280e8_417x417.png" width="325" height="325" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4fd2b4b6-5493-42d2-b66a-76b4dcf280e8_417x417.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:417,&quot;width&quot;:417,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:325,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Image result for 2uinc education&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Image result for 2uinc education" title="Image result for 2uinc education" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fd2b4b6-5493-42d2-b66a-76b4dcf280e8_417x417.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fd2b4b6-5493-42d2-b66a-76b4dcf280e8_417x417.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fd2b4b6-5493-42d2-b66a-76b4dcf280e8_417x417.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fd2b4b6-5493-42d2-b66a-76b4dcf280e8_417x417.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h3><strong>COMPANY OVERVIEW:</strong></h3><p>2U (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TWOU">TWOU</a>)&nbsp; is a global leader in the online education technology industry for some of the top Universities.&nbsp; They build, deliver, and support digital and in-person educational offerings with their proprietary 2U-0S&nbsp;SaaS cloud platform. They also provide the courses and infrastructure for short courses and boot-camps.&nbsp; Basically, with 2U&#8217;s platform, students can pursue their education anytime in their career, anywhere, without quitting their jobs or moving. This is shown with the fact that over 84% of <a href="https://s26.q4cdn.com/441000616/files/doc_presentations/2020/Consolidated-Deck_2U-2020-Investor-Day.pdf?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link">2U's clients</a> are full-time employees.</p><h3><strong>Product lines:</strong></h3><p>The business is primarily broken down into two categories:</p><ul><li><p><em>Degree Program</em>: This encompasses all the undergraduate and graduate programs services provided to Universities. The company recently began bundling both together calling it Degree programs ((DP)) as we will refer to later in this analysis.&nbsp;2U creates and manages degree programs for universities by providing the digital infrastructure that universities need to attract, enroll, educate and support students at scale. They partner and assist with marketing the programs, curriculum design and an admission team to help attract and retain qualified students. &nbsp;</p></li><li><p><em>Alternative Credentials Program</em>: This is the second aspect of the business where they provide the technology for professional certificates, boot camps, and short courses through GetSmarter and Trilogy, both subsidiaries acquired by 2U. GetSmarter helped 2U expand their short-courses to reach over 150 countries and give the company greater geographical reach. Trilogy helped expand their offerings to include skills-based training programs for professionals and adult-learners. At the end of 2020, these businesses have fully been integrated into 2U.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h4>Competitive Product Positioning</h4><p>As you can see below, 2U is currently positioned across all aspects of the Digital learning and Education industry through those acquisitions. Example: If you are a student who decides that you do not need a University degree, but want something short-term for picking up new skills or if you are student deciding to get your full degree all the way to the Graduate segment, 2U meets all of these needs. This is one of the best competitive advantages that 2U holds against their competitors as seen below.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36ab68ee-52b3-4272-b030-0b4a69d6c1f9_561x320.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36ab68ee-52b3-4272-b030-0b4a69d6c1f9_561x320.png" width="561" height="320" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/36ab68ee-52b3-4272-b030-0b4a69d6c1f9_561x320.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:320,&quot;width&quot;:561,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36ab68ee-52b3-4272-b030-0b4a69d6c1f9_561x320.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36ab68ee-52b3-4272-b030-0b4a69d6c1f9_561x320.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36ab68ee-52b3-4272-b030-0b4a69d6c1f9_561x320.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36ab68ee-52b3-4272-b030-0b4a69d6c1f9_561x320.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://s26.q4cdn.com/441000616/files/doc_presentations/2020/Consolidated-Deck_2U-2020-Investor-Day.pdf?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link">Source: 2U</a>)</em></p><h4>2U University Partners:</h4><p>One of 2U's solid moat is the breadth and depth of their customer partnerships across some of the most prestigious and well-funded Universities across the world from North America to Europe.

As seen below, we are looking at a $2.5T Education Industry by 2025. Currently,&nbsp;one of the interesting aspects of the industry for 2U is that within this multi-trillion dollar Total Addressable Market, In the US alone, Graduate education is worth around $80B and Undergraduate education is worth around $550B. Currently, only less than 4% is digitized! 2U is only a $4B company today. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F844672cb-a2e9-4164-9c3e-59a86d1bbca0_509x501.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F844672cb-a2e9-4164-9c3e-59a86d1bbca0_509x501.png" width="331" height="325.7976424361493" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/844672cb-a2e9-4164-9c3e-59a86d1bbca0_509x501.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:501,&quot;width&quot;:509,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:331,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F844672cb-a2e9-4164-9c3e-59a86d1bbca0_509x501.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F844672cb-a2e9-4164-9c3e-59a86d1bbca0_509x501.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F844672cb-a2e9-4164-9c3e-59a86d1bbca0_509x501.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F844672cb-a2e9-4164-9c3e-59a86d1bbca0_509x501.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>(Source: 2U)</p><p>According to HolonIQ (This is the world's leading information source on Education technology). They analyzed that in 2020, institutional education spending was just around $227B on digital. They forecast this number to grow to $404B by 2025 -- and it is still barely 5% of overall expenditure and considered by many as quite conservative. While the longer term impact of COVID-19 on education models is yet to play out, over the next few years HolonIQ expects an upswing of spending on digital infrastructure in education and greater spending over the long term in new digital models as shown below.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9cd8a1f9-e95d-4480-8f86-3d3268c708cc_518x302.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9cd8a1f9-e95d-4480-8f86-3d3268c708cc_518x302.png" width="448" height="261.18918918918916" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9cd8a1f9-e95d-4480-8f86-3d3268c708cc_518x302.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:302,&quot;width&quot;:518,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:448,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9cd8a1f9-e95d-4480-8f86-3d3268c708cc_518x302.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9cd8a1f9-e95d-4480-8f86-3d3268c708cc_518x302.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9cd8a1f9-e95d-4480-8f86-3d3268c708cc_518x302.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9cd8a1f9-e95d-4480-8f86-3d3268c708cc_518x302.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>(<a href="https://www.holoniq.com/edtech/10-charts-that-explain-the-global-education-technology-market/">Source: HolonIQ</a>)&nbsp;</p><p>Also, its important to track Venture Capital ((VC)) Investments in the World.

If 2U decides to expand their offerings in Asia or internationally as discussed on the call, this will massively expand their TAM.&nbsp;</p><p>To conclude here, I believe 2U's strategy of positioning their business along all aspects of the education landscape positions them to capture market share in this massive learning and education market.</p><h2><strong>Competitive Advantages &amp; Industry Moat:</strong></h2><p>After evaluating the market opportunity, let us evaluate how 2U is competitively positioned to capture a greater share of this market:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><em>Strength and depth of Industry Relationships and Partnerships</em>: As mentioned earlier, 2U has partnerships with top-tier quality and well-funded (deep pocket) universities. These partnerships are contracts that last over 10-15 years furthering the strength of the relationships and increases the switching costs for these Universities especially if the program is successful. The large network of numerous partnerships increases their network effects, which then makes it easier for 2U to attract new universities and bargain better prices in the future. </p></li><li><p><em>Deep Industry Expertise within Higher Education:</em> 2U was one of the first mover in developing online programs from way back in 2008. The company has deep expertise, knowledge and huge data about students&nbsp;that makes it efficient for them to set-up new programs due to technical know-how. They know what works and what doesn't. Hence, Universities may prefer to partner with 2U rather than have to spend/invest lots of money into developing a whole program from scratch.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><em>Recurring nature of Revenue Education and Degrees:</em> For 2U's business model, the high marketing invested to attract a student 'today' especially in a degree program typically brings revenue that lasts over a 2- 4 year period, hence, there is a guarantee of future cash flow.&nbsp;Also, the structure of their Long-term contracts give 2U some level of revenue stability.</p></li><li><p><em>Barriers to entry:</em> 2U's early lead in the market limits partnership opportunities for competitors due to significant set-up costs and time to create new partnerships. The more partnerships and students attracted by 2U, the stronger 2U's moat increases along with the scale of the business model making it harder for new entrants.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><em>Competitive Positioning</em>: 2U is currently positioned well across the entire online education landscape from short-online courses to University level as discussed. The fact that 2U has strong partnerships with universities enables them to set-up more reputable short-courses that can wean weaker Massive Open Online Competitors without any. </p></li><li><p><em>The future of tuition benefits 2U</em>: It is debatable whether Tuition will keep going up or down into the future. 2U benefits both way. If Tuition goes higher, 2U will benefit from their revenue sharing model of their programs. If online education proves to successfully drive down the cost of tuition, 2U benefits from the fact that universities will want to partner with 2U due to core competency (reasons mentioned above), hence, 2U benefits from scale of students. This is debatable and can be viewed from different angles, but I believe there is an advantage here for 2U long-term.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Financial Analysis:</strong></h2><p>First, let&#8217;s recap by asking how does 2U make money? It is primarily driven by the number of students enrolments. The drivers are an increase in degree programs or offering with university, attracting and retention of those students. The bulk of its costs are associated with marketing and setting up a program.&nbsp;</p><p>Degree Program makes up around 60% of revenue and Alternative Credential ((AC)) Programs make up around 36% (this has grown to represent an increasing share of revenue).</p><h4>Revenue profile:</h4><p>As seen below. Historically, the company&#8217;s 3-year compounded annual revenue growth rate hovers around 37- 40% consistently. For the full-year, 2020 revenue was $774M (35% Growth YoY). For the Quarter 4, 2020, they reported revenue of $215.3 million (32% growth YoY based on Q4). Although, growth is gradually slowing down. The organic growth has been impressive.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf188a54-42b3-435d-b54e-f1da624acbed_640x384.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf188a54-42b3-435d-b54e-f1da624acbed_640x384.png" width="592" height="355.2" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/af188a54-42b3-435d-b54e-f1da624acbed_640x384.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:384,&quot;width&quot;:640,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:592,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf188a54-42b3-435d-b54e-f1da624acbed_640x384.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf188a54-42b3-435d-b54e-f1da624acbed_640x384.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf188a54-42b3-435d-b54e-f1da624acbed_640x384.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf188a54-42b3-435d-b54e-f1da624acbed_640x384.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><em>(Source: 2U)&nbsp;</em></p><h2><strong>Investi Analyst 2021 Valuation:&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>We&nbsp;know that&nbsp;SaaS businesses are valued on a multiple of their revenue - in most cases the projected revenue for the next 12 months ((NTM)).

If we assume shareholder dilution increases by 2% to 76M shares outstanding, we get a stock price of around <strong>$130</strong> Price Target or Forward EV/Sales of around $9.7B from today's market cap of $4B.&nbsp; My Bull-Case is $200 PT if 2U multiples expand to 15x or revenue exceeds $1B which is still cheap compared to peers and not out of this world.</p><h4><strong>Risks &amp; Competition:</strong></h4><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4de1927b-5726-4373-aef6-4bb5d630cc05_989x447.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4de1927b-5726-4373-aef6-4bb5d630cc05_989x447.png" width="507" height="229.14964610717897" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4de1927b-5726-4373-aef6-4bb5d630cc05_989x447.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:447,&quot;width&quot;:989,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:507,&quot;bytes&quot;:209470,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4de1927b-5726-4373-aef6-4bb5d630cc05_989x447.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4de1927b-5726-4373-aef6-4bb5d630cc05_989x447.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4de1927b-5726-4373-aef6-4bb5d630cc05_989x447.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4de1927b-5726-4373-aef6-4bb5d630cc05_989x447.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Below I show the Global Open Online Market for education learning.&nbsp;</p><p><em><a href="https://www.holoniq.com/">Source: HoloniQ</a></em></p><ul><li><p><em>Competition</em>: Yes, there is competition. 2U's direct competitors are Pearson (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSO">PSO</a>), Wiley (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JW.A">JW.A</a>), Bisk and Academic Partnerships. (Mr Durant has <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4401020-2u-weak-competitive-position-driving-losses">extensive details on them</a>). I will note that most of these companies are publishing companies as their foundations before they began pivoting into providing online education platforms. They had to do major acquisitions to enable them transition into this segment. 2U is far above them, both companies experienced challenges in 2020 as evidenced by their negative and low-digit revenue growth in 2020 despite Covid tailwinds meanwhile 2U kept experiencing growth north of 30%. Hence, I believe that 2U holds significant competitive advantages over each of these competitors.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><em>Indirect Competition from YouTube and Massive Open Online Courses competitors as listed above (MOOC</em>): There are people who argue that there is intense competition from platforms such as YouTube, Edx, Coursera or corporations using Docebo (DCBO) (which I covered already here) for enterprise learning. 2U is differentiated from these companies in the sense that the certificates they offer comes accredited by a top University in most cases and 2U does have a breadth of offerings and partners that none of their competitors can match. </p></li><li><p><em>Risk that University decide to set-up programs without 2U</em>: As I mentioned earlier, there is intense financial risk and costs required to set-up new programs by a University. Setting Zoom classes is a temporal solution as new online programs requires much more effort and logistics for its long-term success. The value proposition to universities is that 2U takes on most of those logistical costs for a percent of revenue and less risks for the&nbsp;universities.</p></li><li><p><em>Concerns around TWOU&#8217;s ability to scale and reach profitability: </em>Based off&nbsp;my participation in the earnings call, one of the concerns that circle around is the high-cost of setting up programs. 2U has gradually settled these concerns in 2020 as shown by the improvement shown in my bottom-line analysis. </p></li></ul><h4>Management Team:&nbsp;</h4><p>A brief note here is that 2U is founder-led which is important.&nbsp; Chris Paucek was a founding member of TWOU from the beginning. While he doesn&#8217;t own a significant amount right now, he still owns a decent amount of the company. I have listened on different calls and observed the team is very focused on the future. They want to capitalize on the current Covid tailwinds and they are focused on the big-prize of the massive market opportunity.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bonus Thesis:&nbsp; *Cautionary*</strong></p><p>This is a bonus fact, which is not a core reason to invest into 2U. However, I find it interesting that Ark Investment is one of the top majority shareholders of 2U. It is owned across three of her five - <a href="https://ark-funds.com/wp-content/fundsiteliterature/holdings/ARK_INNOVATION_ETF_ARKK_HOLDINGS.pdf">ARK</a>K ETF portfolios. This is rare. She owns over 18% of the company's S/O, whenever she owns a company in more than three portfolios, and it is in the Top 10% of all their 200+ holdings, it means she has seen something and is extremely bullish similarly to the way she built her position into Tesla in 2018-2019. I thought I would mention this because of her incredible vision as a stock picker.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6d62ce8-e7e0-4b6a-95c4-520ab862225e_375x155.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6d62ce8-e7e0-4b6a-95c4-520ab862225e_375x155.png" width="321" height="132.68" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e6d62ce8-e7e0-4b6a-95c4-520ab862225e_375x155.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:155,&quot;width&quot;:375,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:321,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6d62ce8-e7e0-4b6a-95c4-520ab862225e_375x155.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6d62ce8-e7e0-4b6a-95c4-520ab862225e_375x155.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6d62ce8-e7e0-4b6a-95c4-520ab862225e_375x155.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe6d62ce8-e7e0-4b6a-95c4-520ab862225e_375x155.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>(Source: Refinitiv data)</p><h2>BOTTOM-LINE:&nbsp;</h2><p>Finally, 2U has built a leading position in the online education market with deep partnerships with the world&#8217;s leading institutions, depth of technical know-how and competitive positioning with a balanced product portfolio across all aspects of digital learning and education. Their competitive position creates significant barrier to entry from a cost advantage perspective in the degree programs, depth of industry relationship and expertise that I believe 2U holds over competitors.</p><p>As you can see below that many organizations were not ready for the digital transformation in Education. considering 2U's deep expertise in this industry, the market opportunity is unbelievable rip in the future years ahead. According to HolonIQ research, the education industry as a sector is a digital laggard with less than 4% of overall expenditure allocated to digital, presenting a serious challenge given the scale of what&#8217;s to come.

While HolonIQ forecast this to grow to $404B by 2025, it is still barely 5% of the overall expenditure and considered by many as conservative. While the longer-term impact of COVID-19 on education models is yet to play out, over the next few years research expects an increased spending on digital infrastructure in education and in new education digital models.&nbsp;</p><p>Blended Online education is simply the future.

The company negotiates the rates for application placements with advertisers such as Uber, Spotify etc. If we use Lyft in this example &#8212;&gt; Digital Turbine collects the fees/money from an app developer/advertiser &#8212;-&gt;  then remits roughly about 60% to the service providers (such as AT&amp;T&nbsp;&nbsp;or Verizon. In Canada, Bell or Telus) while Digital Turbine retains the rest. It is a network effect business where every advertiser or service provider Digital Turbine adds, its position in the middle is strengthened. </p><p>The image below shows rough the split amongst the three partners to enable an application appear on a phone - 1/3 goes to each provider, 1/3 to Digital Turbine and 1/3 to the OEM provider.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F094d4fd4-83a2-4884-ba3d-439acccb3c96_1134x625.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F094d4fd4-83a2-4884-ba3d-439acccb3c96_1134x625.png" width="365" height="201.168430335097" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/094d4fd4-83a2-4884-ba3d-439acccb3c96_1134x625.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:625,&quot;width&quot;:1134,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:365,&quot;bytes&quot;:218482,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F094d4fd4-83a2-4884-ba3d-439acccb3c96_1134x625.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F094d4fd4-83a2-4884-ba3d-439acccb3c96_1134x625.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F094d4fd4-83a2-4884-ba3d-439acccb3c96_1134x625.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F094d4fd4-83a2-4884-ba3d-439acccb3c96_1134x625.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Check out this quick 1-minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzn_qmyIOGk&amp;ab_channel=DigitalTurbine">Product overview</a> if you want to understand the product process. </p><h4>Partners:</h4><p>As we have mentioned, Digital Turbine&#8217;s position is further strengthened by its network effects within the value chain.

I won&#8217;t go over each of them as seen above, instead I will focus on the most important ones that contributes over 70% to the bottom-line:  </p><ul><li><p><strong>Dynamic Installs (DT): </strong>Digital Turbine&#8217;s core software platform - DT Ignite, a software that gets built into phones that are made by its partner OEMs (like Samsung) and/or deployed under its partner wireless carriers (like Verizon). Before consumers ever open those phones, Digital Turbine&#8217;s Dynamic Installs software pre-installs apps onto the phones (called Native App Preloads). Once consumers open those phones, DT&#8217;s Set Up Wizard asks consumers if they want to install various different apps. Then, once consumers operate those phones, DT&#8217;s platform leverages the user data to suggest and/or directly install apps related to the consumer&#8217;s interests. It&#8217;s basically a targeted advertising platform, for apps, pre-installed onto phones. </p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Single Tap Install</strong> - This is the company&#8217;s application that enables the user to download an application with a &#8220;just a single-tap&#8221; from any screen on their phone without having to visit the Android PlayStore application. It essentially allows app developers to integrate single tap download functionality on phones.  </p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Mobile Posse Acquisition</strong> - Digital Turbine acquired Mobile Posse. MP is a media product that goes natively on a phone and includes news, weather, sports, and advertisements. This is aspect of the business that is driving future growth. It currently has over 10Million Daily-Active Users with annual recurring revenues growing over 50% YoY. </p></li></ul><p></p><h3>2021 Earnings Review: </h3><p>Digital Turbine&#8217;s growth rates have trended from 34%, to 93% &#8212; acquisitions has boosted the business growth &#8212;&gt; from Q3 2020 - 116% growth  to Q4 2020 - 146% growth rate &#8212; extremely strong over the past year! This is a sign that consumers are spending more of their time on their phones and within applications especially on media events. Secondly,  as mentioned earlier businesses are warming up to the idea of paying money to have their apps programmatically installed on user phones which is also driving growth. </p><ul><li><p>In 2021, the company is forecasted to grow over 110% </p></li><li><p>In 2022, the company&#8217;s growth forecast is over 33% </p></li></ul><p>As investors, we know that higher revenue and earnings growth always leads to higher stock prices. </p><p>I listened to the earning call with the CEO. I provide some takeaways from the earnings call this week including additional reasons why I am bullish on this company&#8217;s prospect moving forward. </p><p>Feel free r<strong>eview my earnings</strong> call review for more details here on the business &#8212;&gt;  <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1357388635763396609.html">Full Details</a> </p><h3><strong>Risks to watch: </strong></h3><ul><li><p>Most of Digital Turbine&#8217;s revenues&nbsp;come from the Dynamic Installs business. Could their be a risk of one of the OEM Partners leaving Digital Turbine soon? This is always something to think about, however the company is increasing their revenue streams. They are moving from being hardware focused to more of a software tech company providing content and tech advertising reducing reliance on the big OEM partners. </p></li><li><p>We will keep monitoring the Gross margins and the overall business margins</p></li><li><p> The risk of people uninstalling applications or not downloading those apps from their phone. However, this risk can be mitigated by consumers who don&#8217;t want to take the time to uninstall the software because of the hassle. Also, consumers might enjoy the data-driven app recommendations, just like many people actually enjoy data-driven Facebook or Google ads, while recognizing some people find it annoying.</p><p></p></li></ul><h3><strong>Bottom Line &amp; The Future: </strong></h3><p>Digital Turbine has transformed itself over the past year to a full stack - digital applications advertising tech company creating a suite of products and services to help advertisers and app developers make, market, and distribute their applications. </p><p>  </p><p><strong>Growth &#8220;Turbines&#8221; - </strong></p><p>Think about the fact that there are about 3.5 billion smartphone users on the planet Earth &#8212; Currently, over 570 million of phone users have Digital Turbine software installed on their phone! (65 million activated within 2020 Q4 despite the pandemic slowdown). In general, they have a 16% penetration considering that Apple handles their own devices. </p><ul><li><p>At 16% penetration, there is no reason to think that this number cannot grow significantly over the next several years. Majority of the world&#8217;s population will eventually have a smartphone, meaning that the number of smartphone users globally will trends towards over 7-billion over time. The more handsets its products are on, the higher the revenue.  Further, digital turbine is currently working on expanding their product and revenue mix through their mobile content business. The company was pulling in over 80% of its revenues from its Dynamic Installs business that programmatically installed apps on user phones - This past quarter, Dynamic Installs comprised less than 50% of revenue.  This other 50% came from the company&#8217;s various new technology and content products, such as SingleTap. </p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Digital Turbine has been increasing their International partners and advertisers overtime. As I indicated in my earnings call details, this is becoming an increasing part of their revenue and it is going to be huge. The emerging economies of the world have the most to grow in-terms of digital devices.  I expect more growth from this sector and the rollout of 5G networks </p></li></ul><p>Targeted advertising where companies can return-on-investment is increasingly important and growing fast.  Mobile application advertising is clearly a high value-add function, and Digital Turbine is the unrivaled leader in app advertising, with a large competitive advantage through powerful network effects. There are almost no direct competitors for this company. This is a company in its early stages with fascinating growth prospects and transformation underway. </p><p></p><p><strong>Investi Analyst Review:-</strong></p><ul><li><p>Digital Turbine Earnings Details &#8212;&gt; <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1357388635763396609.html">Link here</a></p></li><li><p>Additional reasons of the positive case for Digital Turbine &#8212;&gt; <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1357028625275523072.html">Link here </a></p></li></ul><p></p><p>Thank you for reading.

This was a fascinating week in the history of the markets!  2021 has begun with an interesting twist with the stock market trending worldwide with the Gamestop/Reddit drama. Earlier in January, there were fears surrounding the senate runoffs and the inauguration. 2021 is literally the sequel to 2020 - would you agree?</p><p>The whole Gamestop drama is giving the overall markets a pause. Major institutions are selling their stocks to take profits due to high valuations and volatility. However, the current pullback is very healthy. I am connected with some major market observers who track very important indicators that are indicative of a major pullback, so far everything says this is healthy.  It is important to remember that nothing fundamentally has changed with the economy or the fundamentals for companies, in-fact many companies have reported good earning results till date helping to support high valuations. Hence, the volatility in the general markets should not shake you out. </p><p>On the Investi Analyst newsletter, we&#8217;re focused on the long-term, not two or three weeks from now. We want to find high-quality companies solving major societal challenges and who keep showing great execution for future growth. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabcab026-36ae-493a-bf97-0f563069b99b_984x428.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabcab026-36ae-493a-bf97-0f563069b99b_984x428.png" width="396" height="172.2439024390244" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/abcab026-36ae-493a-bf97-0f563069b99b_984x428.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:428,&quot;width&quot;:984,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:396,&quot;bytes&quot;:148326,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabcab026-36ae-493a-bf97-0f563069b99b_984x428.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabcab026-36ae-493a-bf97-0f563069b99b_984x428.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabcab026-36ae-493a-bf97-0f563069b99b_984x428.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabcab026-36ae-493a-bf97-0f563069b99b_984x428.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h3><strong>Monthly Digest Purpose:</strong></h3><p>I plan to do this at the end of every month to keep ourselves accountable and share frequent updates with everyone on our top-30 company picks which we believe could outperform the markets in 2021.</p><p>At the end of every month, we will review the most active companies within the <a href="https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/p/top-market-picks-for-2021">Top Investi Analyst Top 30</a> portfolio that appreciated or declined greater than 10%.

There are many stock catalyst that drove the out-performance this month. First, Biden&#8217;s confirmation as President and his drive for climate friendly policies means potentially more contracts for Plug over the next years. Secondly, plug power raised their revenue guidance for 2021 and 2024. &nbsp;Thirdly, importantly - was that the company signed two major partnerships and received investments from a leading korean company, SK Group and the automobile company, Renault to develop hydrogen fuel cell systems designed to replace electric material in vehicles in Asia and Europe. Briefly, one of the reasons I believe in this company is only because of their &#8220;technology and access to capital&#8221; - They have many areas that need improvement. However, when hydrogen does fully actualize, Plug will be the leader but note that this will not easily play-out overnight.  It will take many years with a rocky price.

If you missed my deep-dive analysis, it is linked above. Investors were preparing for the much-anticipated Demo-day where Palantir would showcase their software for the first time to the world and provide a future roadmap for the company&#8217;s priorities. I plan to share my key takeaways from the event soon. Palantir has also been signing new partnerships aggressively over the last couple of months &#8211; most recently with Rio Tinto, the energy giant Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) and&nbsp;a new $22.5M partnership with the Japanese government. Hence, the multiple contracts signed over the past month has propelled the stock - I really like this company. More news info and details can be<a href="https://investors.palantir.com/home/default.aspx"> found here</a>. </p></li><li><p><strong>Overstock - (OSTK) &#9989; (</strong>62%<strong>):</strong> This is a fairly old company that is experiencing a transformation. Overstock operates a fast growing online shopping commercial site primarily for mostly home furnishings. They also own a tZERO Segment aspect of the business that focuses on a broker-dealer security transaction of Blockchain and bitcoin assets. The major catalyst was that Overstock announced that it would transition oversight of the Medici Ventures&#8217; portfolio (i.e. their blockchain assets) to Pelion Venture Partners &#8211; to handle the oversight and management of these assets during a period of Bitcoin&#8217;s boom. I&#8217;ve liked OSTK as a pure-play because of their triple-digit growth in their retail eCommerce home furnishing segment, new customers added and new leadership. </p></li><li><p><strong>AcuityAds Holdings Inc - </strong>(<strong>AT.TO</strong>) &#9989; (47%): - a Canadian technology company that provides digital media solutions. The company offers targeted digital media solutions enabling advertisers to connect intelligently with audiences across all digital advertising channels on video or mobile campaigns. The company was hit hard by the pandemic because of their target market focused on small businesses in the food/retail industry. However, right after the approval of vaccines - investors have begun to realize its fast-growing business and potential betting on a bright future post-pandemic as more companies shift advertising away from TV&#8217;s to intelligent devices. </p></li><li><p><strong>World Exp Realty Holdings (EXPI)</strong> &#9989; (76%)- eXp World Holdings, Inc. provides cloud-based real estate brokerage services. The company facilitates buyers to search real-time property listings and sellers to list their properties through its website and provides buyers and sellers access to a network of professional, consumer-centric agents and brokers.  They are one of the fastest-growing Global Real Estate Companies now in the world and benefitting from the booming housing market in North America.&nbsp; The major catalyst was the announcement of a stock-split where their stock would be split into half by March to enable increased access to buying more shares. More details can be found <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EXPI">here</a>. </p><p>*** Fun-fact &#8212;&gt; EXPI stock is up over <strong>15,000%</strong>  - yes 15K! since 2016 - that is quite a remarkable return for their early investors! This stock teaches a great lesson of patience and holding on to your winners for exponential compounding returns. </p></li></ol><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9bf8ddc5-8c5d-4f70-a5fc-154471c193e0_804x669.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9bf8ddc5-8c5d-4f70-a5fc-154471c193e0_804x669.png" width="356" height="296.2238805970149" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9bf8ddc5-8c5d-4f70-a5fc-154471c193e0_804x669.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:669,&quot;width&quot;:804,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:356,&quot;bytes&quot;:57095,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9bf8ddc5-8c5d-4f70-a5fc-154471c193e0_804x669.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9bf8ddc5-8c5d-4f70-a5fc-154471c193e0_804x669.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9bf8ddc5-8c5d-4f70-a5fc-154471c193e0_804x669.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9bf8ddc5-8c5d-4f70-a5fc-154471c193e0_804x669.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h3><strong>POOR PERFORMERS &#128201;: </strong></h3><ol><li><p><strong>Docebo Inc (DCBO) </strong>&#128315; (-20%): A top-learning platform for enterprises, analysis <a href="https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/p/docebo-inc-leading-the-organizational">here</a>.&nbsp; They announced preliminary revenue expecting it be between $18.75M (+48% to 52% Y/Y). The biggest stock catalyst was because the CEO sold some shares and they launched a market secondary public offering of 3.65M shares on the U.S. &amp; Canada markets to raise funds for the company. Stock offerings almost move a stock-price down temporarily. I will also add that it needed some consolidation after a 300% return in 2020.  The thesis and business fundamental are still solid &#8211; in-fact they recently announced they maintained their top positioning for 2021 for the best <a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/docebo-maintains-positioning-core-leader-213000202.html">learning platforms on the market.</a> </p></li><li><p><strong>Dye &amp; Durham (DND.TO)</strong>&#128315; (-15%): Dye &amp; Durham Ltd. engages in the development of software solutions for business law and real estate professionals with my<a href="https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/p/dye-and-durham-disruptor-within-the"> earlier analysis</a>.  They completed their acquisition of a company in Australia that is highly aligned with Dye &amp; Durham's existing product lines. Also, the acquisition means home buyers face higher costs after they recently hiked real-estate software prices by 400% - the market thought this maybe overdone. There was no major developments that would really dent the company&#8217;s future prospects. </p></li><li><p><strong>StoneCo Ltd</strong> <strong>(STNE)</strong>&#128315;(-12%): StoneCo engages in the provision of financial technology and e-payment solutions. STNE benefits from the multi-decade shift from cash and checks to electronic payments. The reason they were a top pick was because of the emerging market trends and the fact that they are building the Digital Payments Ecosystem of Brazil. The latest update this month was that they raised some major financing to build a credit solution for small and medium-sized businesses suffering in Brazil.  It marks an important milestone for them as it enables them advance their strategic roadmap to become a full financial platform for small businesses in an underpenetrated payments market in Brazil. There no new major stock catalyst that happened during the month. The tensions in Brazil may also be playing a role. </p></li><li><p><strong>Vroom Inc (VRM)</strong>&#128315; (-9%): Vroom, an ecommerce platform for used vehicles agreed to buy analytics and digital services company CarStory for about $120 million in cash and stock. No developments happening here, however, I am watching for the company&#8217;s next Q4 Earnings report to determine if its growth prospects are still intact for them to be a reliable top-pick. </p></li><li><p><strong>Goodfood Market Corp (FOOD)</strong>&#128315; (-5%): The Chief Finance Officer stepped down and he was replaced with a different finance chief. There was a major shareholder response as the stock declined to a significant level. Generally in the stock market, when the Chief Financial Officer leaves their job position, it is generally looked at as a bad signal. However, there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the company as they are still benefitting from the current trends.</p><p></p></li></ol><h4><strong>Best Reading Resources:</strong></h4><p>Some of the best resources I found this month to share with subscribers. </p><ul><li><p><strong>Ark Invest Big Ideas 2021 Released</strong>: Ark Invest is one of the most successful and top performing investment research firms in the world.

This number has increased &#8212;-&gt; to over <strong>2,025 </strong>customers in 2020 with the most recent ACV around <strong>$32,000</strong>. This represents a 27% growth rate in customers and contract value 48% respectively. Remarkably, they have maintained a consistent Net Dollar Retention Rate &gt;100%+ since 2019. This means they have consistently being able to continue to upsell their existing customers to buy more products. </p><h3><strong>Key Competitive Advantages/Business Strategy:</strong></h3><p>There are four major competitive advantages that I believe distinguishes Docebo to be a winner within this industry:</p><ol><li><p><strong>User generated content: </strong></p></li></ol><ul><li><p> I draw a comparison with YouTube in success -- The search giant&#8217;s success is based on the premise that all visitors come to YouTube to search and find something that matters to them. Some come to watch short clips, long-forms or how-to video. The second part is that users are empowered and feel they can contribute to the platforms success by uploading content and even making an income from it. Thirdly, YouTube has a great AI algorithm that consistently recommends new videos that are suited to your needs.  Docebo&#8217;s platform serves all three purposes, slightly less on the monetization part. </p></li><li><p> Docebo platform is built around the premise of <strong>empowering </strong>the user or enterprise. After all my review, this is consistent. Docebo builds the foundational work &#8212; the owner/enterprise has the freedom to do anything on the platform such as creating their own applications. To this, Docebo empowers the user or enterprise to upload their content rather than just being a &#8220;watch-only&#8221; platform, the learner can even upload videos on topics they know well for others. </p></li></ul><ol start="2"><li><p><strong>Social collaboration elements:</strong> Docebo&#8217;s platform is built around the notion that 70% of learning is in the form of social learning rather than solely an instructor-led learning. Hence, the platform makes it easy to create, upload &amp; share with peers. They make it enticing with rewards and relative ranking amongst peers. They allow the collaboration to extend to external organizations which is unique. </p></li><li><p><strong>The structure of large contracts and recurring revenues:</strong>  The way the company is set-up is that customers sign contracts to be locked in for multiple years which then provides recurring revenue streams to the company annually. This gives Docebo good visibility into future revenues. Together with these long-term contracts, it increases the switching/opportunity costs for an enterprise moving between platforms once Docebo&#8217;s platform is core to the organization for years.</p></li><li><p> <strong>Leading Industry Ratings: </strong></p><ul><li><p>As indicated, Docebo was announced as One of <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/ca/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/fast50-winners.html">Deloitte's 2020 Enterprise Fast 15 for the Technology Fast 50&#8482; and Fast 500&#8482; Winners</a>. The program recognizes Canada&#8217;s fastest-growing technology companies with the highest revenue-growth percentage over the past four years.</p></li><li><p>Fosway research group ranked their LMS System as a Core Leader for Learning systems. This should further enhance their competitive position.

Docebo focuses on making its platform easy to use and the enterprise/user has a lot of power to adjust the software to their preferences.  Docebo is also very focused on using AI and machine learning algorithms to improve the recommendations on the application, so it is easier for users to find content that cater to them as shown below.

How can institutions get ready to fill these AI roles without a great LMS? </p><p>In 2018, the World Economic Forum estimated that more than half of employees would need significant reskilling or upskilling by 2022.&nbsp; More evidence from Mckinsey shows that the benefits of reskilling current staff, rather than letting them go and then finding new people, typically costs less and brings benefits that outweigh the costs. Investing in employees can also foster loyalty, customer satisfaction, and positive brand perception.

Jason Chapnik founded the company. He is currently the Chairman of the Board and CEO of Intercap, this corporation is a majority shareholder of Docebo with a 51% Ownership stake. Meanwhile, the current CEO, Claudio Erba who has been leading the company since 2014 owns around 4% of the company. This gives a solid 55% leadership ownership stake into the company.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Risks/Competition: </strong></h3><ul><li><p>Direct Competition against Blackboard Community and Canvas Learning management infrastructure. These two companies also provide learning management systems, but these providers seem to focus more on the educational industry. Meanwhile Docebo is focused on the enterprise market. It will be interesting to observe if they pivot to the enterprise market, but I doubt it as  Docebo has a solid expertise in this market. </p></li><li><p>In-direct Competition from other learning platforms: Docebo also faces indirect competition with the likes of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) platforms. These are free or cheap courses provided by Udemy, Coursera, 2U Inc etc. The bear case is if employees or corporations decide to use external platforms for their employee learning and development. With the flexibility of Docebo&#8217;s platform, I doubt the biggest enterprise will go and look for pre-built platforms like a Coursera. </p></li><li><p>The current vs future investment into LMS by organizations: As much as the best and innovative organizations prioritize learning as a priority for their corporation. We need to ask the question how much current investment by companies affected badly will be placed on learning systems by more organizations in a pandemic or will the spending be prioritized for a future date. Does it affect Docebo. This will be important to watch, but so far Docebo grew their business and market opportunity last year despite the pandemic.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Growth drivers/future growth: </strong></h3><ol><li><p>Up-selling existing customer base: It will be important to see how much Docebo can continue to increase their upselling and scale amongst their existing customer base. An example will be increasing their business within other lines of business for Amazon, Walmart or Uber. </p></li><li><p>Capitalizing on leading industry ratings and high-profile customers should further allow them to reach and expand their customer base to get more clients. </p></li><li><p>Geographic expansion across Europe and Asia &#8211; Docebo has highlighted plans to continue to expand their business beyond Europe and other aspects of Asia. This will be important to watch especially since they have a strong presence in Italy.   </p></li><li><p>New product launches: Docebo plans to expand their product offerings so as to cover the entire learning management landscape. Two core areas include &#8212; a) Course Builder: an automatic AI that creates online courses from unique web sources b) Learning Analytics: an easy way to use analytics to evaluate learning progress that can advance better decision making for individual learners or as a corporation in general. </p></li><li><p>Strategic alliances/Acquisitions: The company is planning for more opportunistic acquisition or strategic alliances to help them achieve this goal of expanding their offerings, so this is important news to watch over the next months.</p><p>  </p></li></ol><h3><strong>Bottom Line/Summary: </strong></h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52014bb2-3080-4a9d-a180-ffc62edd29d7_756x524.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52014bb2-3080-4a9d-a180-ffc62edd29d7_756x524.png" width="540" height="374.2857142857143" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/52014bb2-3080-4a9d-a180-ffc62edd29d7_756x524.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:524,&quot;width&quot;:756,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:540,&quot;bytes&quot;:381545,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52014bb2-3080-4a9d-a180-ffc62edd29d7_756x524.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52014bb2-3080-4a9d-a180-ffc62edd29d7_756x524.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52014bb2-3080-4a9d-a180-ffc62edd29d7_756x524.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52014bb2-3080-4a9d-a180-ffc62edd29d7_756x524.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p></p><p>Modern workers are feeling the pressure to skill up, with one in three working Americans (32%) saying they feel pressure to learn new tech-related skills to protect their jobs. Nearly half (49%) of workers in multiple countries believe training in using new technology would help them increase their chances of a promotion or raise. We all  know this :) </p><p>As automation, increased digitalization and technologies take over more corporations. There will be an increased need for better learning tools for employees to keep up on the digital economy. Almost all major corporations are racing to ensure their employees can pick-up new skills to keep up pace with technology.</p><p>Docebo has executed successfully by consistently growing their top line business. They have won some of the biggest customers in North America. They also have some of the best industry ratings with regard to their technology offering. Going forward, it will be important to watch if competition affects them overtime or growth slows down. </p><p>Docebo has begun building an important moat within this sector. Currently valued around a small $2-billion market cap, Docebo has all the potential to provide a 5-7x return over the next five years! </p><p>All corporations have important learning and development goals for their employees because it is only human for employees to seek growth in their careers. The virus has reduced travelling for conferences; hence, employees are doing most of their learning on computers. Docebo will continue to be a major beneficiary of this trend and they will be an interesting company to watch over the next year!</p><p></p><p>Thank you for reading. Have a good weekend everyone!

I posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/InvestiAnalyst/status/1349427579862671360">Twitter thread</a> on our <a href="https://twitter.com/InvestiAnalyst">Twitter page</a>  with a general overview of the company.  For those that do not have a Twitter account, this is an opportunity to read more about the company. </p><p>Goodfood Market ranks as one of the fastest growing companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange in Canada, growing at triple digits ( whooping 267%+ Compounded Growth) and is currently benefiting from the trend towards online grocery shopping and less consumer visits to the grocery store. They were added to the S&amp;P/TSX small cap and selected to the TSX 30 as one of the top performing stocks in 2020.  We&#8217;ll get to know more about them. </p><p><strong>INDUSTRY TRENDS &#8211; Online Grocery Shopping:</strong></p><p>I would like to begin by looking at what is happening big picture before we conduct our deep dive. How often or convenient has it been to get to the grocery store since March?  The online grocery industry is among the fastest growing industries in the world. </p><p>The pandemic has made people reluctant to visit stores. Further, because of restrictions and lockdowns (especially since December in Canadian major cities like Montreal and Toronto). For some consumers, the reluctance is as a result of the need to avoid large crowds in shopping malls such as amongst the much older/health sensitive individuals at risk.  This has further boosted eCommerce and online shopping.  The heightened growth has been spurred by a sharp acceleration in penetration driven by a rise in first-time users of online shoppers for groceries. </p><p>In 2015, Only around 15% of Canadians purchased groceries online, a number which rose to 25% in 2017, but reached 55% as of March 2020. As the data below shows, the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for online shopping is now forecasted to grow by 56% CAGR through 2025 as more people embrace getting their groceries delivered. More data can be seen below: </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd0a6031-a61f-417a-97a8-953948366407_863x760.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd0a6031-a61f-417a-97a8-953948366407_863x760.png" width="485" height="427.1147161066049" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fd0a6031-a61f-417a-97a8-953948366407_863x760.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:760,&quot;width&quot;:863,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:485,&quot;bytes&quot;:92041,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd0a6031-a61f-417a-97a8-953948366407_863x760.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd0a6031-a61f-417a-97a8-953948366407_863x760.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd0a6031-a61f-417a-97a8-953948366407_863x760.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd0a6031-a61f-417a-97a8-953948366407_863x760.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Also, pre-pandemic, the worldwide online grocery market was expected to grow by more than US$227 billion over the next five years, more than doubling in size to US$374.9 billion. In Canada, before the pandemic, less than 1% of Canadian&#8217;s shopping for  C$124 billion worth of items took place online. Initially, that penetration was expected to increase at a 21% CAGR to over C$2 billion by 2023, largely driven by changing consumer expectations and technology innovation. However, the current pandemic has shifted growth expectations upwards and timelines forward. Growth initially planned to occur in 5 years is forecasted to occur in less than 3 years. </p><p>The online grocery market in Canada is now estimated to have reached approximately C$6 billion. Grocery incumbents and emerging players alike are quickly building a wide range of product lines and concepts (e.g., &#8220;Grocerant&#8221;) to cater to the increasingly busy lifestyles of Canadians nationwide and those working from home.</p><p>The charts below show the transformation happening and the growth in online grocery shift accelerating specifically to the Canadian market as well as in the United states.

An analyst remarked, that  &#8220;same-day delivery was the next logical step for Goodfood in its pursuit of a larger share of the food-at-home opportunity.&#8221; This new service strengthens the company&#8217;s value proposition as same-day delivery is essential since this is consistent with the quick turnaround consumers expect for grocery shopping and delivery. Also, it leads to repeated orders for more products. </p><p>Faster delivery times are a clear differentiator compared to the competition. The launch is timely given the accelerated penetration of online grocery shopping in Canada since the beginning of the pandemic. This product should support the company&#8217;s next phase of growth. Goodfood is also one of the first companies to offer same-day delivery service in the meal kit industry.  Capgemini industry research shows &#8220;75% of consumers say they would spend and shop more frequently with a retailer that offered timely delivery of online grocery orders.&#8221;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c86eda5-5543-4c3a-8856-575e7895ceee_624x287.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c86eda5-5543-4c3a-8856-575e7895ceee_624x287.png" width="624" height="287" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8c86eda5-5543-4c3a-8856-575e7895ceee_624x287.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:287,&quot;width&quot;:624,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:80085,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c86eda5-5543-4c3a-8856-575e7895ceee_624x287.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c86eda5-5543-4c3a-8856-575e7895ceee_624x287.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c86eda5-5543-4c3a-8856-575e7895ceee_624x287.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c86eda5-5543-4c3a-8856-575e7895ceee_624x287.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p></p><p><strong>BUSINESS STRATEGY &amp; VALUE PROPOSITION:</strong></p><p>When we consider an grocery shopper wanting to pick between ordering online versus going to the store like Walmart, some of the most important factors for shoppers would include the following; (I highlight how Goodfood plans to utilize these factors for their strategy): </p><ol><li><p><strong>Location: </strong>One factor on the consumer&#8217;s mind is the proximity, distance and convenience to arrive at the store. Online shopping eliminates the issue of travel as long as you are sure the grocery will arrive when you need it. On Goodfood&#8217;s path, the company has built 7 major production factories across Western and Eastern Canada with a capacity to serve over 35M Canadians across the big cities and the ability to gross over $1billion in sales. The company aims to become more vertically integrated so as to control more of the supply chain since this is very important in food delivery. </p></li><li><p><strong>Price: </strong>Another key factor is the price of the grocery. Most shoppers care about lower costs as much as possible.  Goodfood offers very competitive prices than their competitors and aims to match stores like Walmart. This has been achieved by offering lower prices on certain items driven by fulfilment and delivery density. </p></li><li><p><strong>Selection: </strong>Increasing the variety of food selection is very important to the consumer, so they don&#8217;t feel like they can&#8217;t find certain key items. Goodfood offers a wide product offering of over 4000 items and 400+ Goodfood branded products. However, this is still an area the company needs to improve upon when compared to the competition. </p></li><li><p><strong>Ease of use of the technology: </strong>The ability for consumers to use the eCommerce store. It is important for consumers to be able to easily use the website to quickly enter their orders.

We have observed that a large portion of food consumption is moving from restaurants to grocery/home meal solutions. Goodfood had been growing over 100% prior to the pandemic, so I&#8217;ll imagine this period will further spur their growth as they help consumers with food delivery.  </p><p>Goodfood believes there are significant opportunities to continue to rapidly grow its subscriber base and basket sizes by investing in highly targeted marketing campaigns, capacity expansion and investments in technology automation. There may be risks associated with the strong competition from some incumbents as well as how well they can improve their margins. I am confident that their investment in production facilities and automation will further help in this direction. </p><p>I look at Goodfood as a young  &#8220;Amazon fresh&#8221; for food delivery building a moat with a strong brand connection for consumers with opportunities for international expansion. The more people have to stay home longer and restrict their movements outside, the higher the convenience and willingness amongst shoppers to embrace new behaviors in online shopping, leading to permanent behavioural changes at home.  Goodfood is innovating within this space and I&#8217;m confident they are in a great position to capitalize on this trend into the future. </p><p></p><p>Have a great weekend!

There are no certainties as 2020 has shown, but we believe that these companies and their stocks are poised for success due to the rapid innovation and industry tailwinds from 2020. </p><p>Many companies reported exceptional performance over the last year. To try to name each one of them would be an exhaustive exercise. Hence, I have selected a niche group of companies based on the following criteria and filters: </p><ol><li><p><strong>Small and medium capitalization companies: </strong>Generally, small market cap companies<strong> </strong>fall into the category of (&lt;$300b &#8211; $2 billion) and mid-cap companies fall into the ($2b - $10 billion) category. I put more focus on the latter category because data shows that as the economy gradually recovers from major shocks, small caps outperform their larger counterparts in post-elections by about 4%. Secondly, identifying small caps in great competitive position with exceptional products early into their story can provide the biggest stock upside returns. For example, can you imagine buying Tesla shares just four years ago at $35? </p></li><li><p><strong>Consistency of revenue/sales growth: </strong> We are after companies where the last twelve-months of revenues and sales growth have accelerated over 30% year-over-year consistently and the future professional analysts growth forecast is high compared to historical. It is important to note that whenever analysts forecast future growth of about 15% for a stock, this is generally considered very good (more discussion about this later).  Specifically, our focus is on companies that will grow regardless of whether there is a pandemic or not.  </p></li><li><p><strong>Leadership team</strong>: Companies whose founders, CEO&#8217;s and management teams are considered visionaries and hold significant shares of the company. This augurs well for external shareholder returns because leaders make long-term decisions in the interest of the investors. </p></li><li><p><strong>Focus on innovation and disruptive technologies</strong>: We are interested in companies that are disrupting new industries that will thrive over the next decade. </p></li><li><p><strong>Official analyst&#8217;s growth forecast:</strong> Professional analysts interviews with the  executive management teams of these companies, reviews of earning calls, participation in analyst and investor meetings presented by the company. &nbsp;Analysts factor in massive amounts of information into their modelling before making future predictions. No one is perfect in the market with predictions, however, the forecast can give us a &#8220;guide&#8221; or &#8220;glimpse&#8221; of what to expect in 2021. </p></li><li><p><strong>Slight emphasis on Canadian brands</strong>: I would be showcasing some of the best stories in Canada since we have a large Canadian subscriber audience. </p></li></ol><p>P/S: The compilation of the names of these companies are based off results from research from reviewing multiple companies and industry reports. I have used stock symbol abbreviations throughout the article, so feel free to google the symbols and you&#8217;ll find the companies immediately. &nbsp;All the links attached for every company directs you to where you can find in-depth analysis on those companies. </p><h3>Big Picture Company Overview: </h3><p>Here is a broad overview of all the companies that will be discussed in this article: </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37999b62-59fa-4b60-883e-14dc5b58efaa_714x375.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37999b62-59fa-4b60-883e-14dc5b58efaa_714x375.png" width="714" height="375" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/37999b62-59fa-4b60-883e-14dc5b58efaa_714x375.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:375,&quot;width&quot;:714,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:41920,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37999b62-59fa-4b60-883e-14dc5b58efaa_714x375.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37999b62-59fa-4b60-883e-14dc5b58efaa_714x375.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37999b62-59fa-4b60-883e-14dc5b58efaa_714x375.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37999b62-59fa-4b60-883e-14dc5b58efaa_714x375.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>I have identified three categories of stocks, the top picks and the justification for selection.  </p><h3><strong>First Category: </strong></h3><h4><strong>Telemedicine:</strong></h4><p>The foremost trend is Telemedicine - After reviewing multiple industry reports, there is consistency that telehealth is here to stay. The figures for telemedicine and virtual health are just striking. I&#8217;ll review a few here. Another data recently from the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/20/american-well-raises-194-million-as-telemedicine-demand-skyrockets.html">CNBC</a>, showed that in 2019, total virtual healthcare visits in the US were 96,000, but in 2020 total virtual visits were over 18,000,000 million, representing almost a 19,000% increase. There is no doubt some of these changes will remain for an exceptionally long time.</p><p>The Federal Communications Commission is spending $200 million to improve connectivity between patients and virtual-healthcare providers, and the US Department of Health and Human Services has increased reimbursements for telemedicine. It has also allowed the provision of virtual care. Sweden&#8217;s <a href="https://www.kry.se/en/about/">KRY International</a>, one of Europe&#8217;s biggest telehealth providers, reported that registrations were up more than 200 percent. France and Korea have both updated regulations to ease access to telemedicine. All based on global extensive studies conducted by McKinsey in their <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/leadership/the-next-normal-arrives-trends-that-will-define-2021-and-beyond">2020 report</a>. With the circulation of the vaccine to the general populace at least months away, patients and healthcare providers both have reasons to expand virtual interactions. A healthcare expert, Fisher believes that telehealth could account for 30 percent of all healthcare visits in the future. Governments have and will continue to invest significantly into healthcare</p><p>My favorite picks are <strong><a href="https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/p/cloudmd-a-digital-health-company">CloudMD</a></strong> &#8220;DOC.TO&#8221; and <strong><a href="https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/p/well-health-technologies-an-underdog">Well Health</a></strong> &#8220;WELL.TO&#8221; , not only because of telemedicine but their digitization efforts across Canadian healthcare. In both of those articles, I provided reasons why I opted for those names. I would like to recognize Teladoc Health (TDOC) as one of the best leaders within this space in North America. However, we are after stocks with significant upside that can give us 10x returns with less competition. I believe these Canadian companies have a good competitive position in Canada including great management teams and solid strategic plans with a history of successful acquisitions ahead</p><h4><strong>eCommerce and Payments</strong>:</h4><p>In nine of 13 major countries surveyed by McKinsey, at least two-thirds of consumers have tried new forms of shopping. And in all 13, 65 percent or more explained they intend to continue to do so. Mckinsey also states that in developing markets - Brazil and India, for example - the pandemic will accelerate digital shopping, albeit from a &#8220;low base&#8221; - this is why I like StoneCo (STNE) and even other high-quality names like Sea Limited (SE) because these countries still have low eCommerce usage.</p><p>e-Commerce was already meaningfully and visibly eating into the sales of brick-and-mortar stores. What the pandemic has done is to accelerate a change in shopping habits that was already well established. Early indications from China based on the McKinsey study, are that new customers and markets - specifically individuals aged 36 and over and residents of smaller cities - have begun to shop online in greater numbers. In Europe, 13 percent of consumers said in early April that they were planning to browse online for the first time. Specifically, the shift to online retail is real, and much of it is here to stay. In the United States, the penetration of e-commerce was forecast in 2019 to reach 24 percent by 2024; by July 2020, it had hit 33 percent of total retail sales. To put it another way, the first half of 2020 saw an increase in e-commerce equivalent to that of the previous ten years&#8221;.</p><p>My favorite name in this sector is <a href="https://www.etsy.com/">ETSY</a>, which is a marketplace for buyers and sellers to buy or sell goods online. ETSY has recorded over 100% growth throughout the pandemic period (which began with the sales of masks). Etsy is an upcoming player in its space with strong brand recognition. Special mention to <a href="https://www.shopify.ca/">Shopify</a> - also the leader in this category, but ETSY could provide significant upside in comparison. The fintech and payments providers will be the major beneficiaries. </p><p><strong>Consumer products: </strong></p><p>Celsius (CELH) is a leading healthy energy drink provider. The company has been growing exponentially. As the economy reopens and consumer spending increase, I can see the company benefiting significantly. In addition, there could be lasting changes to consumer attitudes towards health choices and Celsius has a good chance of becoming the next Monster Energy. Increased health awareness and a corresponding desire to live more healthily could bring lasting change to where, how, and what people eat. I also encourage everyone to look at names within the consumer staples industries - lots of beneficiaries. </p><p><strong>Cybersecurity:</strong></p><p>Another impressive sector that cannot be ignored is Cybersecurity. This is a significant area that will continue to grow irrespective of the pandemic. Towards the end of last year, the US Government <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c13dbb51-907b-4db7-8347-30921ef931c2">experienced</a> one of its biggest hacks in history. This exposed the weaknesses of security in government and corporations, thereby making everyone realize the need for increased spending on preventing these hacks. As more companies move to the cloud due to digital transformations, more urgency and importance will be placed on cybersecurity to protect data. <a href="https://hhhypergrowth.com/a-crowdstrike-deep-dive/">Crowdstrike</a> &#8220;CRWD&#8221; and <a href="https://hhhypergrowth.com/flavors-of-security-zscaler/">ZScaler</a> &#8220;ZS&#8221; are the major leaders in North America, both generating revenues over 85%+ and 52%+ quarter over quarter respectively.

This company provides web infrastructure, security, and performance services for organizations. This is a highly innovative company that keeps launching new products and software for clients. In 2021, I believe they will cater for small and medium-sized businesses as a huge part of their customer base providing all the services required as more businesses move to the cloud. Also, I believe that, as the economy reopens, many will prioritize the needs of Cloudfare. Special mention here also goes to <a href="https://seifelcapital.substack.com/people/14194168-christopher-seifel">DataDog</a> (DDOG) - this is one of the major leaders in cloud transformation that provides data monitoring to companies transitioning to the cloud.</p><p><strong><a href="https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/p/palantir-technologies-americas-most">Palantir </a>(</strong>PLTR) is already well documented within my earlier post. In a nutshell, this is a company that is providing lots of essential services to the government because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The technology has played a key role in contact tracing, drug developments, and not to mention the Data Analytics and Artificial intelligence work they provide for many government agencies in DC. In recent times, the company has been winning multiple new contracts and I believe the biggest growth driver is the moment they expand to the private sector in 2021. </p><p><strong><a href="https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/p/dye-and-durham-disruptor-within-the">Dye and Durham</a></strong> (DND) is a cloud-based company that provides many essential services to legal and real-estate departments as well as helping to digitize these sectors to the cloud. Clientele includes the top-20 law firms and big banks. I believe there is tremendous growth ahead in 2021 as the economy reopens. &nbsp;</p><p><strong><a href="https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/p/lemonade-disrupting-the-insurance">Lemonade </a>(</strong>LMND<strong>)</strong> is an insurance company that I have written extensively about, so I won&#8217;t go into lots of details. I believe that after the shock from the pandemic, more people will realize the need for insurance.

I have attached two of the best resources in the link above. </p><p>&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Digitization of online learning and education: the biggest beneficiaries from this trend are both <a href="https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/p/2u-leading-the-online-education-disruption">2U Inc</a> (TWOU) and <a href="https://www.chegg.com/">Chegg</a> (CHGG). I have previously done some research on 2U as it was one my biggest convictions in 2020. The transition to online learning is not only happening within schools, but it is happening within corporations. The biggest beneficiary in North America this year has been <a href="https://www.docebo.com/">Docebo</a> (DCBO), a Toronto based company which will be the focus of my next deep dive (stay tuned) </p><p>&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharing and gig-economy: the high levels of unemployment has made many individuals to consider selling their skills to generate either full-time or part-time income through freelance gigs. In addition, organizations have found it easier to hire cheaper talents through this platform. The biggest beneficiary is <a href="https://beth.technology/fiverr-explosive-growth-with-a-bright-future/">Fiverr Marketplace </a>(FVRR). Upwork is also remarkably interesting but require better execution to match Fiverr. </p><p>&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Digital payments and Fintech trends: this is a continuation of the eCommerce trends. As the savings rates accelerate- and consumer confidence returns, so will spending, with &#8220;revenge shopping&#8221; sweeping through sectors as pent-up demand is unleashed. That has been the experience of all previous economic downturns. I am very bullish on this industry. I published a recent report on <a href="https://investianalystnewsletter.substack.com/p/nuvei-corporation-disrupting-the">Nuvei Corporation </a>. Also, I believe StoneCo (STNE) Shift4Payments (FOUR) and Lightspeed (LSPD) not featured could have massive upsides in 2021 since their client base will be having recoveries this year.</p><p>&#183;      Rise of cloud and edge-networks: I have discussed extensively about the Cloud. My second pick beyond Cloudfare is <a href="https://seifelcapital.substack.com/p/fastly-inc-nyse-fsly-summary-research">Fastly</a> (FSLY), a leading cloud edge platform.  The company helps organizations to improve website demands as well help keep up with complex end-user requirements by powering fast, secure, and scalable digital experiences.

Other eCommerce names that are doing unique things is Mohawk group holdings (MWK) and Overstock (OSTK)</p><p>&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Online car-purchase and marketplace trends: Less than 10% of respondents feel comfortable carsharing but prefer buying a car.

The caveat is if the vaccines are successful and the new virus strain does not hold the economy back from recovering. Hence, these sectors have a high-risk to reward ratio, <strong>If the economy </strong>recovers well into the second half of 2021. Some picks here include AirBnB (ABNB), Futu Holdings (FUTU), Upstart(UPST), Canadian banks and some selective airlines. </p><p><strong>2021 IPO&#8217;s to watch:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Some IPOs that I am looking forward to exploring and conducting more research on, include the likes of  Affirm, Roblox, UI Path, Robinhood and Coinbase. These are exceptional companies off the surface. </p></li></ul><p>&#8212;</p><h3>Important factors to watch:  </h3><p>There are three key assumptions needed to hold true for the top picks to become big winners in 2021:  </p><p><strong>The US Federal Reserve, interest rates and money supply: </strong>The money flowing into equities has exploded. Interest rates are near zero meaning the attractiveness of stock equities vs bonds has skyrocketed. There&#8217;s simply very little yield i.e. there is nowhere else where individuals can put their money and generate a good return beyond stocks. &nbsp;Money has flown out of Government bonds because they are at historical lows. Simultaneously, the government is printing stimulus money, and that has to go somewhere. If the US Federal Reserve changes their stance on interest rates and yield rates go much higher in the later half of 2021 - technology and cloud SaaS stocks could decline. We know the US Feds have mentioned no rate hikes until 2023, so we&#8217;ll keep watching.  </p><p><strong>Valuations and the relative attractiveness of SaaS /technology stocks: </strong>valuations for technology companies are stretched based on historical values, meaning that prices are above their fair value. Most of the money that was pumped into the stock market in 2020 went into technology stocks. We need to keep watching to see if major institutions begin to remove their money from technology and reallocate them to these beaten-down sectors of travel, energy and financials as the economy recovers especially with high-technology valuations, so we will keep watching. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Digital Transformation expectations:</strong> There is an expectation that digital transformations will accelerate, meaning technology/SaaS businesses will grow faster in the short term, and potentially maintain that growth mid to long term.  2021 will truly show if technology/SaaS were successful on the company&#8217;s earnings results. We need to follow closely all the results from the company&#8217;s - I will do so on our <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/InvestiAnalyst">Twitter page here</a>.</strong></p><h3><strong>Final words: </strong></h3><p>2021 will be an interesting year. Nobody can truly predict or anticipate the future. We can only use past data to help inform future decision-making. I am sure that throughout the year, new companies will emerge while some past big winners will disappoint. There will be big declines and big upward stock movements, be prepared. The most important thing is to focus on your financial and investing goals and stick to it.  </p><p>I look forward to sharing the rest of the investing year with your support and the community over the 2021 investing year.

We begin with a brief outline to serve as a springboard for our discussion:  </p><ul><li><p>Online businesses and digital payments have become essential to keeping many small businesses alive during the pandemic this year. Companies that provide the platform and serve as enablers to facilitate digital payments online have become more vital to help the economy. </p></li><li><p><a href="https://nuvei.com/en-ca/">Nuvei Corporation</a> became the largest technology IPO in Canadian history on the Toronto Stock Exchange in September, bigger than Shopify and Lightspeed. Interestingly in 2020, Shopify which was founded in 2006 became the biggest company in Canada based on Market Capitalization, surpassing the value of Royal Bank of Canada. Does Nuvei have what it takes to become the next Shopify? We will discuss extensively on Nuvei and sprinkle some differences between Lightspeed and Shopify.  </p></li></ul><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88d4785a-e586-4d17-8741-b809b5eff9bc_624x536.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88d4785a-e586-4d17-8741-b809b5eff9bc_624x536.png" width="624" height="536" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/88d4785a-e586-4d17-8741-b809b5eff9bc_624x536.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:536,&quot;width&quot;:624,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:64668,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88d4785a-e586-4d17-8741-b809b5eff9bc_624x536.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88d4785a-e586-4d17-8741-b809b5eff9bc_624x536.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88d4785a-e586-4d17-8741-b809b5eff9bc_624x536.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88d4785a-e586-4d17-8741-b809b5eff9bc_624x536.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p></p><p><strong>INDUSTRY:</strong></p><p>Let&#8217;s begin by briefly looking at what is happening within the Financial Technology and e-Commerce industry. </p><ul><li><p>The future of mobile commerce and e-commerce has been accelerated by Covid as we&#8217;ve heard many times in 2020.

They are part of a select group of payment providers that can serve complex verticals, including regulated online gaming, regulated FX trading and regulated financial services compared t competitors.  </p></li><li><p>International growing markets: Nuvei&#8217;s management team focuses on high-growth target markets within international markets. They acquired a company called Safe Charge for $889M (big deal) because it provides a full-service payment platform for payment growth and it allowed them to further enter into the UK market. Nuvei made another acquisition of Smart-to-pay, to allow them entry into the Dutch market including other international countries.</p></li><li><p>Nuvei&#8217;s key competitive advantage that differentiates it from Lightspeed, and Shopify is the fact that they have built their own proprietary <strong>native commerce platform &#8211; </strong>This is simply all the &#8220;technology&#8221; involved when you swipe your card to make a payment.

This simplified payment methodology for Nuvei&#8217;s merchants reduces dependence on third-party vendors, cuts out costs and allows for better transparency of the process for Nuvei&#8217;s merchants. This single vendor experience is difficult to replicate for those who operate multiple platforms and differentiates them from other payment providers like Shopify or Lightspeed. &nbsp;Further, through their single integration to their multi-currency pricing technology platform, merchants can securely accept payments for services sold online in nearly 150 currencies, can settle locally in over 200 markets and there are over 450 payment alternative methods.

The company benefits from higher sales volume and transactions from its merchants.</p></li><li><p>Nuvei charges fees for processing everything in-between providing payments solutions for gateway technology and, </p></li><li><p>Extra back-end &amp; front-end value-added services such as Business Intelligence and Analytics Dashboard information. </p></li></ol><p>Generally, </p><ul><li><p>Revenues for the last couple of years (2017, 2018, 2019, YTD 2020); $124M, $149M, $245M, $259M, For the last trailing-twelve months were $338M+ with Gross profit of $205M.  </p></li><li><p>Gross margins are at a stunning 83%. (This is due to the fact that they cut-out third-party vendors.) </p></li><li><p>Professional analysts forecast revenue of US$351 million in 2020, US$456-million in 2021, and US$525-million in 2022. The company is profitable on an operating profit basis but making a loss on a Net basis. Analysts are expecting the company to become profitable in 2021 with the average earnings price estimate set at $0.91 EPS on over $151M. </p></li><li><p>Valuation: The company&#8217;s stock is trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 30.5, this is generally high, but relative to Shopify at 60 and Lightspeed at 65, Nuvei is lower. This is also due to the slower growth from Nuvei compared to these companies.  </p></li></ul><p></p><p><strong>MANAGEMENT TEAM/CULTURE:</strong></p><p>The company is led by the company&#8217;s founder and CEO, Philip Fayer. He has a 93% approval rating on Glassdoor based off 59 reviews which is not enough, but generally suggest employees love working there with their leader. All employees received around an estimated $100,000+ of company share round from the company&#8217;s successful IPO which is really impressive.  </p><p>The company has a strong shareholder base. The company&#8217;s founder, chairman and chief executive officer Philip Fayer owns over 34-million multiple voting shares. CDP Investissements Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Caisse de d&#233;p&#244;t et placement du Qu&#233;bec, owns over 21-million shares. The positives are the fact that the founder still leads the company and holds a substantial amount of the company&#8217;s share ownership which hopefully align shareholder interest with the company long-term.</p><p><strong>RISKS: </strong></p><ul><li><p>Negative merchant reviews compared to Lightspeed and Shopify: There have been a number of complaints made against Nuvei by merchants using its platform based on Google and independent <a href="https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/pivotal-payments-review/">customer reviews sites</a>.  It also appears that Nuvei has had branding issues in the past which led to them changing their name to Nuvei from Pivotal Capital Payments.  </p></li><li><p>Extensive cost cutting: Nuvei utilizes extensive indirect and independent sales agents to attract and sell accounts to merchants. This has led to situations where a merchant has difficulty accessing someone within the company leading to complaints, and poor onboarding experiences.</p></li><li><p>Nuvei signs merchants up for long-term contracts with automatic renewal clause. Merchants claim there are other hidden undisclosed fees to encourage quick sign-ups. </p></li><li><p>Intensive competition and growth: My observation is that while Nuvei has grown well over the last two quarters, however, their year-over-year growth rates over the last couple of years is much slower than that of Lightspeed and Shopify. This signals that the intense competition within this industry could be affecting Nuvei, which could be a reason for them aiming at international market expansion. </p></li></ul><p><strong>Industry Competitors: </strong></p><ul><li><p>Other key industry players that compete directly and indirectly include companies like Shopify, Square, Stripe, PayPal and Lightspeed which have grown exponentially. However, more direct competitors are the ecommerce payment channels such as Adyen and PayPal and other payment processors (such as Fiserv, Global Payments, Shift4 Payments and Worldpay).</p></li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Key differences between Nuvei, Lightspeed and Shopify below as at September 2020: </strong></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F042900e1-0277-4a7e-ab03-ff21b0bb1806_624x247.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F042900e1-0277-4a7e-ab03-ff21b0bb1806_624x247.png" width="648" height="256.5" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/042900e1-0277-4a7e-ab03-ff21b0bb1806_624x247.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:247,&quot;width&quot;:624,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:648,&quot;bytes&quot;:69450,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F042900e1-0277-4a7e-ab03-ff21b0bb1806_624x247.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F042900e1-0277-4a7e-ab03-ff21b0bb1806_624x247.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F042900e1-0277-4a7e-ab03-ff21b0bb1806_624x247.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F042900e1-0277-4a7e-ab03-ff21b0bb1806_624x247.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wietr2O0lY&amp;ab_channel=TheFireGrind">Source: FireGrind</a></p><p><strong>Brief key observations:</strong></p><ul><li><p>First and most importantly, the value proposition and branding: Nuvei position themselves as more of a payments technology facilitator that also provides merchant services meanwhile Lightspeed and Shopify are primarily focused on SMB merchants - to enable small businesses have successful online stores.  </p></li><li><p>Customers: Shopify has a significant customer base of smaller business size at over 1Million compared to 77,000 for LSPD and 50,000 for Nuvei.

It is said that it takes 40-66 days to form a habit. The change in customer habits and convenience of easily shopping online in 2020 is a behaviour that will not change anytime soon. </p><p>Nuvei has benefitted this year from the industry tailwinds. Some of the key positives with Nuvei is their proprietary native commerce platform that reduces friction for merchants and reduces cost. They are a global business across the world allowing further growth in countries with low eCommerce penetration. Based on a financial perspective, they are profitable on a operating basis than their peers, boast higher gross margins at 80%+ and management appears to be very efficient about the way they run the business. On the negative side, Nuvei&#8217;s unhappy customer reviews and issues could deter potential merchants and be beneficial for competitors. </p><p>The benefit of investing within this industry is that there is a major tailwind that allows all of these companies to be successful from the transformation in fintech. On a company valuation basis, Nuvei and Lightspeed at less than $10-Billion look attractive compared to Shopify at over $100B Market Cap. We can anticipate that over the next 3-5 years, Nuvei could provide shareholders and investors with a potential 10X return if they are able to execute well within their international markets and attain a quarter of the valuation of Shopify. To answer our initial question, I would say that so far it does not appear that Nuvei has what it takes to become a future Shopify anytime soon.&nbsp; However, considering Nuvei&#8217;s strategy of going after complex vertical international markets within the niche payments ecosystem, I would not bet against them.

It has definitely created a niche for itself amongst its 25,000 customers and has managed to achieve a great level of product-market fit amongst large institutions such as the top law firms and financial institutions. Its competitive advantage is that it will be difficult for these large institutions to easily stop utilizing D&amp;D&#8217;s software because of the knowledge, history, and value it provides to them.  This is proven by the &lt;2% low churn rate. </p><p>D&amp;D also has a strong financial position. The company has sustained a proven track record of growing the business while achieving high operating margins.  This is impressive when compared to its peers within the high growth technology industry. </p><p>The current valuation for Dye and Durham stock-price may be overextended at current prices, but for investors looking out over a 3-5 year horizon, this is a market leading company capable of doubling its stock valuation to become a $5Billion company based off its rapid growth.  Investi Analyst is focused on finding digital disruptors with 10X potentials in modern new industries.

But we seem to share fewer and fewer of the technology sector&#8217;s values and commitments.&#8221; said Alex Karp, CEO of Palantir.  </p><p>Palantir is well-known for its work with the US government.

Their software analyzes vast amount of dataset from disparate locations,  decoding and making sense of trends so organizations can make better decisions. &nbsp;</p><p>Founded in 2003, Palantir started off  building software for the intelligence community in the United States to assist in counterterrorism investigations and operations. The company builds, and successfully integrates large-scale, disparate data in a cohesive and coherent manner to give insight and drive actions.</p><p>Palantir has over 125 customers; across 36 industries and in more than 150 countries. Most of their strategic relationships last for years and the average length is over 6-years. The average revenue per customer is $5.6M. </p><p>Company breakdown - Palantir&#8217;s business is categorized based on two principal software platforms: &nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Palantir Gotham (&#8220;Gotham&#8221;) -</strong> Gotham is built primarily for government clients. The software enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, ranging from signal intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants, and helps U.S. and allied military personnel find what they are looking for. </p></li><li><p><strong>Palantir Foundry (&#8220;Foundry&#8221;)</strong> - Foundry is utilized by commercial organizations to create a central operating system for their data. An organization having problems with integrating data from different parts of the organization, making sense of the data and needs to centralize everything would hire Palantir. Foundry is also used by entire industries like Airlines. There are also solutions for financial compliance, insurance, automotive, manufacturing and sales. </p></li></ul><p><strong> Business Strategy &amp; Competitive Edge:</strong></p><blockquote><ol><li><p>Palantir&#8217;s customers pay to use the software platforms they have built. The company&#8217;s business sales model is broken down into: </p><ul><li><p>Acquire - The acquire phase provides customers with short-term pilot deployments or testing of Palantir's software at little to no cost for the customer.   </p></li><li><p>Expand - Palantir ramps up its investment in the expand stage to understand the issues faced by the customer and its industry.  </p></li><li><p>Scale - Scaling is taking it to the next level and Palantir's platform starts to proliferate within the organization. </p></li></ul></li><li><p>Customer switching costs: It takes Palantir months and months to fully implement their software, so imagine having to cancel this plan. There are significant switching costs after the implementation and integration of the software. </p></li><li><p>Palantir has a moat (which is a term for distinct advantage a company has over its competitors which allows it to protect its market share and profitability). The company operates largely with no major direct competitors, most especially for the US Government and its agencies.  Palantir has been able to establish its platform as the data operating system within government operations over the last 15-years. Their software has a high-level of security embedded together with the ability to allow collaboration in an organization.</p></li></ol></blockquote><p></p><p><strong>INDUSTRY</strong></p><p>Palantir estimates the total addressable market (&#8220;TAM&#8221;) for their Analytics software across the commercial and government sectors around the world to be approximately $119 billion. </p><ul><li><p>The TAM in the commercial sector is $56 billion based on customers around the world - companies with more than $500 million in annual revenue. </p></li><li><p>For governmental institutions in the US and their allies across the world, it is estimated at $63 billion.</p></li></ul><p>Below is a chart that highlights the top priority for spending in 2021 by Chief Information Officers.

This suggest near-term stock weakness but longer term, it will revert higher. </p></li><li><p>Palantir is not yet profitable and has been sustaining losses over the years.  </p></li><li><p>A key metric for Palantir is Contribution margin &#8211; a measure of our efficiency in selling and delivering our software to customers has steadily been growing (Q3 2019, Q4 2019, Q1 2020, Q2 2020) was 15%, 33%, 41%, 55%.</p><p></p></li></ul><p><strong>FUTURE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Commercial expansion with organizations &#8211; this is the exciting part of the future for Palantir as well as what makes it a good investment is the ability to further implement their software within the commercial sector. Over the last couple of years, Palantir has solely implemented this complex software for the US Government. However, one assume the commercial sector will become more interested in applying their analytics software to their organization and even across industries as highlighted by their <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fec32e48-ddab-11e6-9d7c-be108f1c1dce">Airbus-Airline partnership.</a> </p></li><li><p>New sales team: It is interesting to observe that Palantir since it was founded in 2003 has not had a marketing department or sales team. Now that Palantir has created a sales team to aggressively win more contracts, they should grow even further as shown in 2020. </p></li><li><p>Expanding into more agencies and department across the US government is another growth driver. Palantir plans to expand their reach with U.S. allies abroad and to other Western countries across Europe allowing for more growth. </p></li></ul><p><strong>MANAGEMENT TEAM </strong></p><ul><li><p>The company&#8217;s founders, include the famous Peter Thiel (Past co-founder of Paypal with Elon musk and has many successful initiatives). There is no doubt the management team has extremely brilliant and genius individuals. Karp who is CEO speaks and looks like an Albert Einstein and has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syYUhjJUnJ4&amp;t=415s&amp;ab_channel=TheInvestingOpportunity">a strong personality</a> - obtained his law degree from Stanford (where he and Peter Thiel became friends). Alex Karp and Stephen Cohen, founders own 30.2% of the company&#8217;s stock. This gives confidence to potential investors because we know the company leaders will only do what is in the best interest of the company.  </p></li><li><p>Another interesting fact is that the median age on the management team is around 38 years of age which allows for more visionary and bold leadership. Palantir primarily employs teams of engineers, lawyers, and social scientists to ensure the company remains a leader in its field. </p></li></ul><p><strong>RISKS</strong></p><ul><li><p>Customer concentration is small: The Top 20 customers make up around 61% of total revenue in 2020, although this number decreased from 68% of revenues in 2019. It allows a small margin for error with customers. However, with their expansion into the private sector and being so central to the US government, I see this risk as being minimized. </p></li><li><p>Past controversy history: &nbsp;There has been a controversy from different perspectives that Palantir developed software for ICE immigration services and ICM software for deporting immigrants &#8211; this is one of the many points brought against Palantir because it refused to cancel contracts with the US government as a sign of protest against the issue. </p></li><li><p>The valuation is high at 48/sales valuing the company at close to $51 Billion. They company has a high bar which means they need to continue to execute on growth to achieve its current valuation. </p></li><li><p>Corporate Governance: Class F ownership stake in the company which belongs to the founders is over 50% - this gives them high amount of power in the company. It reduces external shareholders voting powers as outside investors don&#8217;t have the power to make any major changes, so shareholders have to trust the company&#8217;s leaders. </p></li></ul><p><strong>BOTTOM LINE: </strong></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde33aebd-94c3-47be-ad76-36fb557c8e5d_582x332.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde33aebd-94c3-47be-ad76-36fb557c8e5d_582x332.png" width="546" height="311.4639175257732" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/de33aebd-94c3-47be-ad76-36fb557c8e5d_582x332.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:332,&quot;width&quot;:582,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:546,&quot;bytes&quot;:356257,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde33aebd-94c3-47be-ad76-36fb557c8e5d_582x332.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde33aebd-94c3-47be-ad76-36fb557c8e5d_582x332.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde33aebd-94c3-47be-ad76-36fb557c8e5d_582x332.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde33aebd-94c3-47be-ad76-36fb557c8e5d_582x332.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p></p><p>As the popular saying goes, data is the new oil. The next generation&#8217;s asset for any organization is the ability to harness the power of data. Palantir tackles a major issue of data being siloed and ineffective for problem solving, so far it has proven that it can deliver.  The company has a major lead in the governmental Analytics industry with a lack of direct competitors (moat) in a total addressable market of over $199 Billion market. </p><p>Palantir has cemented itself as the default operating system for the US Government and created this niche for itself.&nbsp; There maybe concerns about their small customer niche, the high valuation and past controversy. Their technology is proving effective in the commercial sector with major contracts within Healthcare, pharmaceutical,  manufacturing and recently the airline industry. &nbsp;Palantir has proven to become a major digital disruptor in Artificial Intelligence within the public sector and it will be interesting to watch them execute at this level for the commercial sector which should make their future prospect brighter over the next 3-5 years. Palantir coming to the public markets will enable continue to be a major winner for many more years to come. </p><p></p><p><em>What do you think?
