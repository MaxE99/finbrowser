It is lightly edited for more current statistics. The post over-simplifies how a payment gateway works and is intended to get a high level understanding.</em></p><p>Transactions are at the very heart of an economy and Payments power those transactions. India&#8217;s Financial Sector has seen sweeping reforms post 1991, especially in the banking sector. However, the population is still largely under served when it comes to access to basic financial services. With emerging technologies and growth in telecom infrastructure, Financial services and products can be made available to the masses at low costs.</p><p>India&#8217;s economy is largely driven by cash. The retail digital payments industry is <a href="https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/AnnualReportPublications.aspx?Id=1322">estimated to be $5.5tn</a> but only 50% payments are made digitally in Tier 1 &amp; 2 cities, whereas<a href="https://www.fortuneindia.com/enterprise/in-digital-era-india-refuses-to-let-go-of-cash/106176"> this number drops</a> to 30% in Tier 3 cities and 10% in Tier 4 cities. Printing and distribution of <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/digital-rupee-to-save-costs-of-printing-distributing-and-storing-cash/articleshow/89413532.cms">cash costs ~15-17%</a> of the value of currency in circulation. As of Mar, 2021, India had <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/digital-rupee-to-save-costs-of-printing-distributing-and-storing-cash/articleshow/89413532.cms">$385bn (</a><em><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/digital-rupee-to-save-costs-of-printing-distributing-and-storing-cash/articleshow/89413532.cms">INR 28.32tn at USD 1 = INR 73.5</a></em><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/digital-rupee-to-save-costs-of-printing-distributing-and-storing-cash/articleshow/89413532.cms">) cash in circulation</a> - that's a $58bn cost! India&#8217;s digital payments processing infrastructure has been close to dismal in the past. However, adoption of digital payments has seen a huge growth in the past 5 years. Convergence of events such as advances in technology, deeper penetration of telecom networks, access to high speed mobile data have resulted in increased adoption of digital payments.</p><p><strong>What are Payment Gateways:</strong> Payment Gateway is a merchant service that enables payment acceptance/authorisation for merchants by aggregating various payment mechanisms for the end user (merchant&#8217;s customer). Payment gateways typically earn a percentage of the total transaction amount as commission for enabling/processing the payment.</p><p>Payment Gateways will continue to remain relevant in the future for the following reasons:</p><ol><li><p><em>Growing Number of Payment Mechanisms</em>: With the growing number of payment mechanisms, merchants find it difficult to keep track of successful transactions from each mechanism at the end of each day/month. Payment gateways makes it easier for the merchant to accept payments from any mechanism while maintaining a consolidated dashboard of all successful transaction. With growing methods of payment acceptance, merchants will continue to require a payment processor (payment gateway) to accept, process, settle and report all transactions.</p></li><li><p><em>Prevention of Fraud and Security</em><strong>:</strong> In the financial services industry, fraud and security risks are the highest. Payment gateways need to be proactive about its fraud detection technology and security breaches to protect, not just the merchant but also the consumer</p></li><li><p><em>High costs to maintain large scale payments Infrastructure</em>: Costs involved in building a highly available, fully functional, secure payments network for the scale of India&#8217;s population will be huge. Immediately post demonetization, card networks and ATM servers faced massive outages because it couldn&#8217;t handle the high demand. The more decentralized the infrastructure (more payment processors) the lower the costs and better the service.</p></li></ol><p><strong>How do Payments work?</strong>&nbsp;Payment Settlement is a two step process</p><p><strong>Authorisation Process</strong></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff42eb32b-2d34-4897-94f9-ae7e31421749_1099x372.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff42eb32b-2d34-4897-94f9-ae7e31421749_1099x372.png" width="1099" height="372" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f42eb32b-2d34-4897-94f9-ae7e31421749_1099x372.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:372,&quot;width&quot;:1099,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;This image has an empty alt attribute;

The high CAC will be sustained over long periods to gain customer loyalty.</p></li><li><p>High Fraud and Security Risks: Creative customers find it easy to bypass security features. High cases of fraud have been reported in PG&#8217;s of this model.</p></li><li><p>High cost of expanding to different geographies: Expansion beyond home geography means replicate an already high cost customer acquisition strategy.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Business to Business (B2B)</strong>: <em>e.g. PayU, Razorpay, PineLabs etc.</em></p><ul><li><p>Merchant acquisition is a long process: Merchants have to be acquired one at a time to maintain scalability of the technology. Merchants can be divided into three buckets: low yearly turnover (INR 10-50 Cr), Mid yearly turnover (INR 50 to 2,000 Cr), high yearly turnover (INR 2,000 Cr and above).</p></li><li><p>Sticky Client base: Although merchant acquisition takes long, once the merchant has migrated all payment acceptance to the payment gateway, it is difficult for the merchant to migrate to another PG.</p></li><li><p>Pooled Fraud Detection Capability: With a large merchant base with millions of consumers transaction daily, the PG can pool resources and build fraud detection capabilities within the technology stack. This is a huge advantage over B2C fraud detection capability.</p></li><li><p>Low Cost of Geographic Expansion: Cost of expanding to different geographies is low but time consuming. The process will have to be replicated brick by brick. By building a brand of payments, this time lag can also be reduced inorganically.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Business to Bank (B2Bank)</strong>: <em>e.g. BillDesk, Zeta, Juspay etc.</em></p><ul><li><p>Bank acquisition is a long process: Acquiring banks as customers is a long process as they have existing relationships and vendors. Technology needs to be radically unique to be accepted by banks</p></li><li><p>Lowest cost of Merchant Acquisition: Merchant acquisition is done by the banks at their cost with a large acquisition machinery. In effect, the PG gains significant traction with merchants at virtually no cost.</p></li><li><p>Chances of High growth: With the Bank leading the charge for merchant acquisition, the PG is highly dependent on the bank&#8217;s sales force for growth. Revenue on a transaction commission will take a longer time to gain some traction. Most PG models for banks currently have a licensing revenue model.</p></li></ul></li></ol><p><em>Would love to hear your thoughts on the payments industry in India.

The comments said that Indian fintech startups are "just Direct Selling Agents (DSA) and that limits ability to scale with profitability". Easy to sound smart, Macquarie.</p><p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Macquarie is right</strong>... but only partially. Most insurance and lending business models resemble digital DSA's. Macquarie's "hot take" falters in mistaking all of Indian fintech for lending companies. We've had spectacular innovation in payments (Citrus, Paytm, Razorpay, PayU), stock brokerage (Zerodha, UpStox, Dhan), Wealth management (Smallcase, Strata, WintWealth) and more. None of these companies rely on lending as a core part of their operations. They have elements of lending that support the core business model.</p></li><li><p><strong>Innovation always precedes regulation, in India regulation has other priorities</strong>: Regulators unfortunately do not follow Zuckerberg's maxim of "<em>move fast and break things</em>" and rightly so. Here's the dilemma - Indian fintech startups want to innovate but without a license they have to partner with a licensed entity. Licensed entities fear regulatory action because of lack of precedent and hence err on the side of caution, sometimes overly so. This limits innovation. On the other hand, Indian regulators have largely kept away from issuing licenses to fintech startups. But licenses require large pools of capital which further reduces the pool at the top of the funnel.</p></li><li><p><strong>What's wrong with being a DSA?</strong>: Macquarie uses "direct selling agents" for Indian fintech startups as if it's a bad word. What's wrong with having it as part of the business model? If in providing a credit product the fintech startup provides value to it's customers, why is it a bad thing? Banks are not going to do it. Someone has to do it. We've discussed several times in this newsletter and everywhere else that India is a credit starved country. There's nothing wrong with innovating the DSA model, making it more efficient and giving financial access to more users. In fact, in majority cases, fintech startups participate in risk by giving a First Loss Default Guarantee (FLDG), which no DSA does.</p></li></ol><p><strong>2&#65039;&#8419; Indian fintech stocks are not going as planned in public markets</strong></p><p>Paytm's stock price is down 62% from IPO price and 67% down from high of $23.7. Policybazaar (PB Fintech) as well is down, 36% from IPO price and 47% from high of $19.1. Not really a fintech startup, but Fino Payments Bank is down 47% from IPO price valuing at $314mm. Star Health Insurance's stock price is down 30% from IPO price valuing the insurer at $4.83bn.</p><p>Paytm now is valued at $5.1bn (<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/paytm-dives-to-record-low-wealth-destruction-for-ipo-investors-tops-10-billion-7967611.html">IPO m.cap. of $19bn</a>, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/paytms-market-cap-dips-below-its-16-billion-private-valuation-on-listing/articleshow/87781170.cms">private m.cap. of $16bn</a>).

Oh and Mobikwik <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/business/startups/news/mobikwik-ipo-is-not-happening-this-quarter/articleshow/89891819.cms">didn't go ahead with its IPO</a>.</p><p><em><strong>Note</strong>: Stock price details are as on 17th March, 2022. USD 1 = INR 76</em>.<em> This is not stock recommendations or advice.</em></p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Disconnect between private and public markets</strong>: These public market investors don't seem to be vibin' with us, private market investors. Seriously though, it seems there's a lot more excitement in private markets which is driving valuations high. Public market investors are probably comparing these startups to more established financial firms e.g. HDFC Bank, SBI Bank, Bajaj and others and seeing more returns there. This could trickle down though - globally, public market investors are seeing corrections already and this could force private market investors to do the same. There will obviously be the handful of star startups that will command unscientific valuations but the majority will see corrections.</p></li><li><p><strong>Disconnect between performance and market sentiment</strong>: Paytm grew quarterly <a href="https://www.livemint.com/companies/company-results/paytm-q2-results-net-loss-widens-to-rs-472-crore-11637990683939.html">revenues 64%</a> and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/paytm-q3-results-loss-widens-despite-34-growth-in-revenue/articleshow/89355548.cms">34%</a> in Q2 (Jul-Sep, 2021) and Q3 (Oct-Dec, 2021) respectively. Policybazaar grew revenues 16% and 34% quarter-on-quarter in Q2 and Q3 respectively. These companies were still loss making. Similarly with the other public financial companies that went public recently. What gives?</p></li><li><p><strong>Sachin Bansal's has other goals with his IPO</strong>: Odd that Sachin Bansal's going ahead with his IPO despite all this gloom in not just Indian markets but global ones as well. Methinks Sachin has other goals with going public. His licenses (banking, insurance and others) have been declined or stuck for a minute now. The only possible reason to go ahead with an IPO is to gain regulators and public's trust. Going public comes with disclosures, public scrutiny and more and this will potentially help his fintech ambitions with regulators.</p></li></ol><p>Zaheer Merchant from Economic Times <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/why-ipo-bound-fintech-startups-should-have-one-eye-on-their-us-counterparts/articleshow/87719465.cms">wrote this very ominous post</a> in November, 2021.

GoTo's prospectus is in Bahasa only and there's virtually no detailed analysis in English. I relied on some friends to source some for me. Below are some notes.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Fintech is a large business vertical</strong>: For the period 9MCY2021, Fintech &amp; others accounted for 38% of the total Gross Transaction Value (GTV) growing from 32% in CY2018. On-demand Services was 11% and Ecommerce was 52%. This fintech GTV for nine months of 2021, grew 73% YoY to $8.5bn, annualised to $11.5bn. However, Fintech and Others vertical accounts for only 3% of the overall revenue.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fintech has high net margins</strong>: GoTo makes 80% net margins (net revenue/gross revenue) on its fintech business vertical, compared to OnDemand - 32%, Ecommerce - 48%. However, GoTo makes the lowest take rate on its fintech business of 0.5%.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fintech businesses in all verticals</strong>: GoTo has payments businesses, banking, lending, investments, insurance and many others. It claims to be the largest e-money platform and the largest cloud POS platform in Indonesia. I'm assuming the plan is to target and cross sell financial products to its 55mm Annual Transacting Users, 2.5mm driver partners and 14mm merchants (as of 30th Sep, 2021).</p></li><li><p><strong>"Aggressive" valuation</strong>: In GoTo's case as well, all everyone seems to be talking about is the valuation - $29bn seems "<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=goto%20ipo">aggressive</a>".

Traction and scalability of businesses remain important factors for success. But with retail investors occupying a larger part of the table, and critics getting more material to build their arguments on &#8211; the private investors have reacted with tough, traditional business questions to founders.</p><p><em>How do you plan to make money? And once you do, when and how would you breakeven?</em></p><p>The murmurs of this shifting investing focus are more pronounced in South-East Asia given how some of the IPOs have progressed. But, what do these developments mean for the industry?</p><ol><li><p>Primarily, this adds weight to a filter for investors when evaluating companies, which lowers the chances of a startup at the median to get funded.</p></li><li><p>The bag of private capital chasing payments is, however, hardly lighter. This directly implies that the same money would now be chasing fewer companies that would belong to the top-bucket, which should result in more aggressive funding rounds and larger cheque sizes for the few.</p></li><li><p>Moreover, the investor attitude has a domino effect on how companies approach their business strategy. This, I imagine, would make P&amp;L discussions a much higher priority for many a business heads.</p></li><li><p>Lastly, with the P&amp;L in focus, we can also expect a relative deceleration in aggressive customer acquisition, which should perhaps open up discussions on smarter and more innovative forms of creating similar acquisition viral loops.</p></li></ol><p>These implications put across an interesting challenge for the industry, especially given the standard for the last decade.</p><h3><strong>The 2010s: Cashbacks, discounts, and mass-market focus</strong></h3><p>In India, the latter half of the last decade was highly influenced by digital payments. And with UPI, the likes of Paytm, PhonePe, and Google Pay tussled in a continuous battle for customer acquisition over this period.</p><p>Gimmicks of scratch cards and other little games aside, at the most fundamental level - all the B2C payments apps relied on merchant discounts and transaction-based cashbacks for customer acquisition, spending more than a <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/indias-top-payment-apps-spent-close-to-1-billion-to-lure-customers-in-fy19">billion dollars</a> on <em>advertising, marketing, and promotional expenses</em> annually.</p><p>Over time, the products had all gained feature parity and appeared commoditized, which meant that as users multi-homed, i.e. users used multiple competing apps &#8211; not only the acquisition, but even the daily engagement of activated users relied on cashbacks and discounts. Some of this standardization of features was no doubt due to certification requirements, but the lack of strategic focus on differentiation had an equal role to play.</p><p>The commoditization put increased focus on distribution as <em>the </em>only<em> </em>strategy to win. As years went by, the competition switched from acquiring a million to hundreds of millions of users. Consequently, spending on discounts and cashbacks continued to grow in high double digits year-on-year for all those competing.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa30a5214-1966-4a34-847d-d8d17cd27fea_1490x586.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa30a5214-1966-4a34-847d-d8d17cd27fea_1490x586.png" width="1456" height="573" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a30a5214-1966-4a34-847d-d8d17cd27fea_1490x586.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:573,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:308740,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa30a5214-1966-4a34-847d-d8d17cd27fea_1490x586.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa30a5214-1966-4a34-847d-d8d17cd27fea_1490x586.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa30a5214-1966-4a34-847d-d8d17cd27fea_1490x586.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa30a5214-1966-4a34-847d-d8d17cd27fea_1490x586.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Capturing the era of high cash burn for acquisition in payments; Source: <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/indias-top-payment-apps-spent-close-to-1-billion-to-lure-customers-in-fy19">Bloomberg</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Since the investors agreed with the business focus on acquisition, the money continued to pour in despite little to suggest long-term sustainability of the strategy. The cashback and discount-heavy culture also put some of the traditional business principles in the shadow, with the companies going mass-market for acquisition, offering almost uniform rewards across user cohorts.</p><p>Now, with the questions being asked, the strategy seems to be slowly drifting away from the rewards and mass-market culture.</p><h3><strong>Monetising Payments</strong></h3><p>Slowly, payments apps had diversified to insurance, investment, and lending products to monetise their growing user bases. However, the promotional expenses comfortably towered any gains from cross-selling. This has, over the last couple of years, meant that while there is a focus on cross-selling higher-margin products, the expenses had to come down too.</p><p>For Paytm, this has translated to a more than 50% YoY reduction in marketing and promotional expenses. In FY21, the figure stood at INR 532 Cr as compared to INR 1397 Cr the year before.</p><p>This points to an industry-wide trend that draws resemblance with the last few years of the telecom industry in India. History tells us that fighting a price war makes sense if you can outlast others in the market. For Airtel, this was improbable against Reliance, and Airtel chose rightly to shift strategy and focus on a more premium segment, cutting out a big part of its existing user base.</p><p>For payments, it appears to have become a collective understanding to slowly stray away from the cashback wars. Given that almost each of the big four competitors (PhonePe, Paytm, Google Pay, and Amazon) have heavy pockets, the price war would last for many more years.</p><p>For now, the focus is beginning to shift from gross volume to unit economics in payments. If we are to break down the problem, the question then becomes one of maximising take rate for a unit of cost across payments. This is challenging given that few, without the network effects of card networks or processors, have done this well in B2C space. But I briefly suggest a few directions that might make business sense.</p><h4><strong>Loyalty Programs</strong></h4><p>Dedicated loyalty programs can help drive cost-effectiveness by directing the promotional expenses from the masses to a segment of engaged users, who are willing to spend and transact more on the application.</p><p>Given that the big payments platforms today offer services ranging from payments to investments &amp; lending &#8211; the benefits of the loyalty program must be closely tied with the services within the ecosystem to drive higher involvement. This would:</p><ol><li><p>Churn out a set of low quality acquired users as more rewards are directed to those part of the loyalty program</p></li></ol><ol start="2"><li><p>Increase switching costs for frequent users since they will be tied to the loyalty benefits accrued on usage</p></li></ol><ol start="3"><li><p>Allow apps to charge a premium for any value-added services, which could include PFM insights, investment advisory, better lending rates, reward points boost, etc.</p></li></ol><p>There are few better examples in the ecosystem of a well-functioning rewards program than the <a href="https://www.amazon.in/cbcc/marketpage">Amazon Pay ICICI card</a> that has tied <a href="https://www.livemint.com/industry/banking/amazon-pay-icici-bank-credit-card-is-fastest-to-cross-1-million-milestone-11603865789378.html">millions</a> more closely to Amazon.</p><h4><strong>Improve Transaction Economics with Cards</strong></h4><p>Following up on the previous suggestion, cards offer an ideal medium for building a loyalty program. They equally allow a way to earn through relatively higher interchange share, and favorable interest / late fee charges if credit risk is managed well. Moreover, cards have been found to drive better recall with the personalized plastic. So if your card CVP is well-thought out, it&#8217;s a win-win.</p><h4><strong>Manage Risk using Transaction Data</strong></h4><p>I have written <a href="https://uniteconomics.substack.com/p/digital-lending-more-than-a-feature">previously</a> on the potential of transaction data to facilitate digital lending, which offers a high margin play to payments providers. Increasingly, this trend is more apparent in the risk policies of the payments credit products, which are shifting reliance from external bureaus to internal transaction monitoring.</p><p>Transactions offer a host of behavioral data that can be used to assess purchase preferences, channel usage, net-worth, risk averseness, all of which can help inform the repayment behavior of users. &nbsp;Presently, the risk models driven by transaction data are in infancy and will only be able to manage smaller ticket loans. As the models are iterated upon given the market behavior, there is potential for them to serve payments companies profitably by informing the credit behavior better than the static bank statements or oft-outdated credit bureau scores.</p><h3><strong>Final few thoughts</strong></h3><p>The write-up is meant as a short note to highlight the quiet industry movement away from cashbacks towards monetisation, which is no doubt to the benefit of many stakeholders.</p><p>The trend also raises the stakes for founders and puts across a challenge that hardly anyone in B2C has crossed successfully in payments. Going ahead, lending &#8211; as it appears &#8211; will need to be closely tied with the product roadmap, and cards &amp; loyalty programs will have to be in fashion for some of the businesses to make sense.</p><p>If the reading of the trend is right, this will be a decade where some of the giants that are unable to crack for unit economics will have to fall. For those that are able to, a bigger market will be waiting to be captured.</p><p><strong>1-min Anonymous Feedback:</strong> Your feedback helps me improve this newsletter.

Was hoping for some benefit from this "offshore jurisdiction" to aide retail investor participation.</p></li><li><p><strong>More experiments like this</strong>: This NSE IFSC US Stock trading is the first, low hanging product launch. There are many more in the pipeline. It's also great that there is government interest aligned with making GIFT city a success. Otherwise, from the few conversations I've had with private sector folks, they're still wary of launching anything yet because everything is "so experimental and fluid".</p></li></ol><p><strong>3&#65039;&#8419; Southeast Asia Round up</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>AirAsia</strong> <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/airasia-money-indonesia">launched </a>AirAsia Money, a financial marketplace in Indonesia and partnered with several startups for various products. <strong>BigPay</strong>, Capital-A backed Malaysian payment startup, <a href="https://technode.global/2022/03/03/capital-a-venture-firm-bigpay-launches-first-fully-digital-personal-loan-product/">launched </a>a personal loan product.</p></li><li><p><strong>Funding Societies</strong> <a href="https://blog.fundingsocieties.com/2022/02/22/introducing-elevate-virtual-card-to-answer-sme-growing-digital-payment-needs/">launched </a>Elevate, a virtual card for SMB digital payments.</p></li><li><p><strong>DBS Bank </strong><a href="https://fintechnews.sg/59532/payments/dbs-rolls-out-bnpl-payments-for-credit-card-users-with-mastercard-and-pine-labs/">partnered with</a> <strong>Mastercard</strong> and <strong>PineLabs</strong> to roll out BNPL product for users in Singapore. <strong>Jiye Technologies</strong>, a Pakistani argi-tech startup, <a href="https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/91665/pakistans-jiye-technologies-launches-bnpl-service-for-agriculture-sector?utm_medium=rssfinextra&amp;utm_source=finextrafeed">launched</a> BNPL for agri input.</p></li><li><p><strong>CIMB Bank</strong> in Malaysia <a href="https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/39772/cimb-takes-credit-hit-of-67-million-over-payments-glitch?utm_medium=rssfinextra&amp;utm_source=finextrafeed">reported</a> a credit loss of $67mm due to a processing error that led to some customers receiving duplicate credits to their accounts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pakistan's central bank</strong> <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1678030/qr-code-standards-issued-to-speed-up-retail-payments">released </a>QR Code standards to accelerate digital payments.</p></li><li><p><strong>Volopay</strong>, a Singaporean corporate cards and payable management startup, <a href="https://e27.co/volopay-raises-us29m-series-a-apac-mena-expansion-20220301/">raised </a>$29mm. <strong>DeZy</strong>, a Singaporean cash-to-stablecoin startup, <a href="https://e27.co/dezy-raises-us2-2m-in-pre-series-a-funding-round-led-by-leo-capital-20220228/">raised </a>$2.2mm.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>AirAsia's fintech ambitions</strong>: By now I'm assuming you've heard people say <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/advisor/2020/07/15/how-airlines-make-billions-from-monetizing-frequent-flyer-programs/?sh=11d986b14e91">that</a> airline companies are actually rewards and loyalty companies. Well, AirAsia wants to take it up a notch by wanting to become a fintech company. They've already launched BigPay, a neobanking platform with 2mm customers, in Malaysia because of the brand that is AirAsia. Now they seem to be expanding geographically with the launch of AirAsia Money in Indonesia. I've never seen an airline get into fintech but will be following AirAsia's fintech ambitions outside home turf.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pakistan's QR Code Standards</strong>: After launching Raast, Pakistan's instant bank transfer system, in Feb, 2022, State Bank of Pakistan (central bank) this week released QR code standards. They've gone the India route of mandating standards for interoperable, standard QR codes. These measures will probably be looked at as an inflection point for Pakistan's digital economy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pay later is growing in South and Southeast Asia and is getting more contextual</strong>: While the overall market sentiment towards Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) seems to be declining, startups in this part of the world can't seem to get enough of it.

Us startup folks know a Unicorn to be a privately-held company valued at or above one billion dollars. In 2013, Aileen Lee, an angel investor used and popularised the term Unicorn in the context of startups because of the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance)">statistical rarity</a>" of such a valuation. That was just about 9 years back. Today, per CBInsights, there are <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies">over a thousand unicorns</a> globally! Talk about statistical rarity!</p><p>India's first ever unicorn - InMobi, was minted in 2011. Since then, Indian startups have been on a tear. There have been <a href="https://inc42.com/the-indian-unicorn-tracker/">94-96 unicorns minted</a> in India till Feb, 2022.

One would imagine there is more than just one lending unicorn in a credit starved country. In fact, lending startups have raised a ton of funding over the years.

An unhealthy concoction of innovations not working out, implosion of the broader market, investor appetite and the business just being tough to build led to the dearth of lending unicorns.</p><ol><li><p><strong>The promise of alternate data based underwriting didn't deliver</strong>: The rise of smartphone's allowed one to access previously inaccessible data - smartphone data, social data, geo-location data, call logs, messages and much more. All that data, unfortunately, didn't stand a chance to the good ol' credit score. Even today, credit scores account for 60-80% of some fintech lenders' underwriting. This led to "new to credit" borrowers becoming a small portion of the overall borrower base.</p></li><li><p><strong>Slow implosion of the NBFC market since 2018</strong>: The <a href="https://thewire.in/business/ilfs-downfall-banking-india-economy">fall of IL&amp;FS</a> in 2018, the pandemic and the moratorium that was instituted in 2020, the Chinese loan app situation in 2020 and more - all these macro events led to a very unstable environment for fintech lending startups. The startups performing well had to taper their growth. Bulk lenders became wary of the macro situation and asked for more stringent downside risk protection, they limited their book even to startups that had strong book performance and more. Three years of tapering has sort of undone a lot of their growth from the previous years.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lending is a tough business</strong>: As with any marketplace, managing both demand (borrowers) and supply (debt capital providers) can be challenging and they're not easily solvable with tech - especially the collections side. How do you solve for a government mandated moratorium when you have real interest payments to meet? How do you solve for a capital provider not honoring their agreements to lend because they've got the jitters?</p></li><li><p><strong>Global investors don't invest in lending businesses</strong>: Fintech startups in India could not have scaled without the large sums of capital poured in by global investors. Unfortunately, there are home-country limitations on investments these funds can make in global financial companies and there are RBI's limitations as well. There's a reason why "what we think" as lending unicorns in the above list don't think of themselves as lenders but as commerce platforms.</p></li></ol><p>There are many more challenges, and some that I may be forgetting. <a href="https://twitter.com/PositiveGamma/status/1438748169337073667?s=20&amp;t=Bii1e13s7wP31m4-TFrbFQ">Mr. Rajeev Jain, would probably be smirking at this post</a>, if he reads it.</p><p><strong>Basically, we should not build/invest in credit businesses then - got it.</strong> Not so soon. The overall opportunity for lending still exists and it's only growing. The market is not going anywhere. A lending business of the future may not look like a lending business of the past. Think new products e.g. BNPL - it's effectively a lending product but it's contextual and therefore relatively easier for risk management. Another nascent product is wage streaming - earned wage access with direct integrations to HRMS'. Think customer segment focused lending - e.g. CRED, lending to high credit score users or slice, lending to GenZ. Credit products will increasingly start looking non-"credit-y", more contextual and more embedded. As that happens, we're likely to see more lending unicorns.</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/BeingPractical/status/1481859373181845504?s=20&amp;t=Dulw_mitzwJHP4GLZb7f4w&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Lending unicorns are hard to come by in Indian startups.

Millions of users a signing up across financial products of credit cards, neo banking, insurance and more.</p></li><li><p><strong>Users are in search for better banking</strong>: Niyo's 4mm (multi-vertical) users, Fi's 1mm (general) users and Akudo's 1mm (teen) users shows there's demand for better banking products across user segments. Moreover, most of these neo banking startups work with the same bank at the backend, so it's safe to assume a low overlap in user.</p></li><li><p><strong>Users are hungry for credit (cards)</strong>: <strong>OneCard</strong>, a credit card startup known for its metal card, having 250K outstanding cards is good. But 2mm users checking their credit score monthly on OneScore, a free credit score app by OneCard, is impressive. Not only does that app serve as a customer acquisition tool, but it's also providing OneCard with credit data to improve it's own models. Smart move.</p></li></ol><p><strong>2&#65039;&#8419; Contextual finance is taking off</strong></p><p><strong>TripMoney</strong>, MakeMyTrip's fintech vertical, <a href="https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/tripmoney-ties-up-with-sbm-bank-to-launch-global-credit-card-to-allow-int-l-travellers-to-save-more-11645609911086.html">launched </a>a TripMoney Global Card, a credit card. <strong>Leverage</strong>, a study abroad startup, <a href="https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/study-abroad-platform-leverage-announces-foray-into-financial-services-11641788182240.html">launched</a> Leverage Finance, it's fintech arm for international remittances, loans and banking. <strong>Zomato </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/chandrarsrikant/status/1486894359123427333">to set up</a> a wholly owned subsidiary for an NBFC platform. <strong>Pagarbook</strong>, a staff management startup, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/sequoia-backed-pagarbook-diversifies-into-offering-digital-banking-services-for-smes/articleshow/89012863.cms">launched</a> neobanking and credit services.</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>:</p><ol><li><p><strong>The <s>embedded</s> contextual finance thesis is becoming a reality</strong>: As recent as early 2021, most folks couldn't fathom why a non-fintech company would want to embedded finance solutions within the user journey. That's thankfully changing. These large brands i.e. MakeMyTrip, Leverage, Swiggy, Zomato and more, are embedding finance in the right way, IMO, which should result in better conversions for them. Everything is fintech, yes!</p></li><li><p><strong>License ownership will hopefully become commodity in the embedded future</strong>: When financial services is non-core to a brand, license ownership through embedded finance will become a commodity, as it should be. Financial services are transitioning from being about "no other option" to "quality of experience and pricing" for the user.</p></li><li><p><strong>Full stack servicing</strong>: India's regulations might be a hindrance to the "commodity license" play and that might drive some brands (e.g. Zomato) to own licenses as finance starts becoming core to their product journey. I don't see this becoming mainstream though as dealing with regulation and compliance in India is tougher than being a public company.</p></li></ol><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2fb875d1-688d-464e-b9db-7c63019fdd62_1024x576.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2fb875d1-688d-464e-b9db-7c63019fdd62_1024x576.png" width="1024" height="576" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2fb875d1-688d-464e-b9db-7c63019fdd62_1024x576.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:576,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:229524,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Framework for embedded partnerships in an embedded future&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Framework for embedded partnerships in an embedded future" title="Framework for embedded partnerships in an embedded future" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2fb875d1-688d-464e-b9db-7c63019fdd62_1024x576.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2fb875d1-688d-464e-b9db-7c63019fdd62_1024x576.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2fb875d1-688d-464e-b9db-7c63019fdd62_1024x576.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2fb875d1-688d-464e-b9db-7c63019fdd62_1024x576.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><strong>3&#65039;&#8419;Southeast Asia round up</strong></p><p><strong>Nepal</strong> <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/digital-payments/2022/nepal-adopts-indias-upi-payments-system-to-boost-its-digital-economy/">will adopt</a> India's UPI system to digitise payments in the nation. <strong>Mitsubishi UFJ</strong> <a href="https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/39738/mufg-shutters-blockchain-based-payments-network?utm_medium=rssfinextra&amp;utm_source=finextrafeed">shut down</a> it's blockchain-based payments network, GO-NET Japan, citing the "recent hard business environment" for payments. <strong>Modalku</strong>, the Indonesian SMB finance arm of Funding Societies, and <strong>Carro</strong>, a used car startup, <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/breaking-modalku-carro-invest-indonesias-bank-index-sources">invested</a> in Indonesia's Bank Index for a minority shareholding. <strong>ZA Bank</strong> and <strong>Mox Bank</strong> in Hong Kong <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/digital-banking/2022/hong-kongs-virtual-banks-woo-customers-with-cash-prizes-numberless-credit-cards/">have reportedly cornered</a> two thirds of the deposits among eight digital banks in the country. <strong>China's supreme court</strong> <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/24/chinas-supreme-court-rules-crypto-transactions-constitute-illegal-fundraising/">ruled </a>that crypto transactions constitute "illegal fund raising" with punishment of up to 10 years in prison. <strong>Southeast Asian fintech startups</strong> <a href="https://thisweekinfintech.substack.com/p/this-week-in-fintech-asia-26th-feb?utm_source=url">raised</a> $267mm in funding.</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>:</p><ol><li><p><strong>UPI goes international</strong>: NPCI has done a lot of work over the years to get other countries to adopt UPI.

This is a one-off experiment. Read at your own peril.</em></p><p>Do you remember the time when the "God Particle" was confirmed by scientists? It was an exciting event for me - I love nerding out about this stuff. The discovery of the Higgs Boson, colloquially known as the God Particle, was an important discovery for the entire physics community (and really our entire species) as it confirmed the existence of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDKxw4kLEjM">missing piece of the Standard Model</a> in physics. Back in 2015, I stumbled upon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_Fever">Particle Fever</a>, a documentary following the origins, experiments and progress of the Large Hadron Collider (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uV44aH4c68">video on how it works</a>) near Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has been widely heralded as humankind's most ambitious science experiment ever. But the experiment would never have been possible without Mr. Peter Higgs, after whom the particle is named. Mr. Higgs and his teams first theorised the existence of the particle in 1964. Construction of the LHC started in 1998 and the first experiments were conducted in 2008. 48 years after the theory was released and with billions spent on experiment, the particle was confirmed! As this piece of Johns Hopkins magazine puts it, "<em>The shared belief that this supercollider would tell scientists something new about the field of physics loomed large&#8212;though no one really knew what, exactly, that something might be. Revolutionary physics data happen so infrequently and come at such extraordinary costs that breakthroughs are rare.</em>"</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0957aee7-11c8-4931-8a29-3620df4b452b_3000x2006.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0957aee7-11c8-4931-8a29-3620df4b452b_3000x2006.jpeg" width="1456" height="974" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0957aee7-11c8-4931-8a29-3620df4b452b_3000x2006.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:974,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1623126,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Mr. Peter Higgs in front of an image of one of the Large Hadron Colliders.

Theorists and Experimentalists exist in most fields of work. Without theorists, we will never have creative ideas to advance human goals. And without experimentalists, we'll never know if we can realise those ideas. The field of physics, notoriously so, clearly has these two types of people, as illustrated above. The field of construction too has them - just look at famous architect Zaha Hadid (theorist). Zaha brought a unique curves and design to her buildings that engineers (experimentalists) and almost everyone thought it impossible to build. Without George Lucas and his Industrial Light and Magic company, there would be no Star Wars or special effects in movies.</p><p>The big question here is, who are the theorists in tech? You can think of Steve Jobs as a theorist - he did push the envelope for a phone, tablet, laptop and others products. Who else? I don't consider Naval Ravikant or Balaji Srinivasan as theorists, though they can pass off as such. Naval is more a philosopher for personal productivity and Balaji, IMO, is a "knowledge-dropper". Listen to <a href="https://tim.blog/2021/11/15/balaji-srinivasan-2/">this Tim Ferriss interview</a>, you'll know what I'm talking about. We need to do more in the tech sector. We have few real theorists.</p><p>This whole post is essentially a call for theorists. Theorists observe events, find patterns, explain why they happen and extrapolate it to the future. Without theorists we're headless chickens hoping to make sense of the direction of tech. Unfortunately, we're evolving to think less - like a "do it for me" mentality, we want others to "think for me". It's no wonder that twitter threads and LinkedIn posts that breakdown concepts and models get so much traction. We need theorists to point us in a direction for the future. </p><p>Founders today act as both theorists and experimentalists. They conjure up ideas for what our future should look like and then go out to build it. This isn't an ideal state as being a theorist or experimentalist requires different skills sets. It important for founders to identify which one they are and focus on that. IMO, founders should be "theorists" and hire "experimentalists"/builders around them to execute on their ideas. If a founder is an experimentalist/builder, they need to hire a theorist (not an investor board) on the team to help them think big picture. We have a lot of experimentalists, people who'll execute ideas and get things done and their work is important. We need better thinkers, deeper thinkers and better mentors. People will laugh, validation cycles will be long, breakthroughs will be rare - but we need more theorists.</p><p>What do you consider yourself - a theorist or an experimentalist? Who do you consider a great theorist?

Through the IPO, the Indian government hopes to sell 5% of the insurer for $8-10bn. The government has gone through extraordinary lengths over the past couple of years to ensure this IPO is a success: it <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/govt-moves-irdai-to-allow-listing-of-corporation-ahead-of-lic-s-ipo-121070601504_1.html">amended laws</a> to allow a "corporation" to list, it <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/specials/corporate-file/lic-all-dressed-up-for-its-ipo-party/article65037404.ece">deferred "dividend" payouts</a> of $850mm over the past few years to ensure LIC has adequate capital to meet solvency ratio requirements, it got <a href="https://www.livemint.com/market/ipo/sebi-eases-ipo-norms-paves-way-for-lic-s-mega-public-issue-11613576318513.html">SEBI to ease listing norms</a> allowing a company of LIC's size to offer only 5% at IPO instead of the minimum 10%, it <a href="https://www.moneylife.in/article/govt-should-first-appoint-chairman-for-irdai-who-should-consider-lic-ipo-peoples-commission/66395.html">didn't appoint a Chairman</a> of IRDAI (insurance regulator) for the past year (still vacant position), it <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/specials/corporate-file/lic-all-dressed-up-for-its-ipo-party/article65037404.ece">amended the LIC Amendment Act, 2021</a> to allow policyholders a special reservation in the IPO (earlier allowed only for employees), it is <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/lic-seeks-exemption-from-sebi-on-deposit-norm/articleshow/89604515.cms">seeking exemption</a> from SEBI (securities regulator) on deposit norms (typically 1% of issue size), it is <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/finance/banks-told-to-raise-upi-per-transaction-cap-for-lic-ipo-applications-122021701178_1.html">getting banks to increase</a> per-transaction UPI limits and more.</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>: Beautiful feats can be achieved when interests, intent and action are aligned! All of it is coming together wonderfully for this LIC IPO. A lot of these changes are to accommodate for LIC's size, but there's also another reason for this intent: fiscal deficit target. Indian government is targeting a fiscal deficit of 6.8% of GDP for FY22 (ended Mar-22). The $8bn expected IPO proceeds is expected to play a large part of bringing down the fiscal deficit. It was 9.2% in FY21 (ended Mar-21). This is a large reason why the IPO is being rushed to close before end of Mar-22.</p><p>This listing is so important, that the government is going ahead with it despite macro-economic fears (US fed rate hike, Ukraine invasion, Chinese economic troubles etc.) and more. Foreign Portfolio and institutional Investors are also trimming their stakes in other listed Indian insurers to make room for LIC allocation. The IPO is great generally for Indian fintech startups as well - increased awareness on insurance products, record number of demat accounts being opened, investors using digital payment methods and more.</p><p>Aside, wonder which of the equity research houses will be negative on LIC! &#128516;</p><p>2&#65039;&#8419; <strong>RBI&#8217;s deputy governor released a Cryptocurrency Assessment</strong></p><p>RBI's Deputy Governor, T Rabi Sankar, <a href="https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_SpeechesView.aspx?Id=1196">made a statement</a> that <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/cryptocurrencies-threaten-financial-sovereignty-need-to-be-banned-rbi-dy-guv/articleshow/89574807.cms">banning cryptocurrencies</a> is the most advisable choice. The statement was <a href="https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_SpeechesView.aspx?Id=1196">part of his assessment</a> on cryptocurrencies.</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>: The RBI deputy governor made some sound arguments in his assessment, IMO, and the assessment makes for a very good read. He highlighted the four key reasons people give to regulate cryptocurrencies i.e. 1) blockchain is promising and will give India an edge if regulated, 2) most major countries are regulating not banning, 3) many Indians are already invested in crypto and banning it will lead to wealth loss, and 4) banning is unlikely to be effective. He then goes on to counter each of those arguments with examples, analogies and reasons why those arguments don't hold water. It certainly makes for a great <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/the-web3-debate">debate to Packy</a>.</p><p>The deputy governor, IMO, is over-indexing on risks of cryptocurrencies, as he should. But in that process, he is selectively using information and facts to make his point. He cites bitcoin several times initially and even talks of the downsides of bitcoin's energy consumption, but ignores that "proof-of-work" consensus mechanism is not used anymore by modern protocols, including Ethereum which is cited later in the doc. He states that banning private cryptocurrencies is advisable, but ignores the challenges of a Digital Rupee (CBDC). There are more such examples of selective opinions in the document.</p><p>The bigger challenge, IMO, is that of the silence of the crypto community. Most proponents of the crypto community had rebuttals to the tune of "<em>what an uncle, he doesn't understand</em>". There're no counter-arguments by anyone in the crypto community. This "lost in translation" situation of the regulator's language and that of crypto community is stark with neither side making an attempt to learn the other's language yet. Coinswitch is the only one, IMO, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/coinswitch-appoints-r-venkatesh-new-head-of-public-policy/articleshow/89585985.cms">making that attempt now with the appointment</a> of a Head of Public Policy.

The startup has 4+mm registered users, 99% of whom are investing for the first time! 4+mm users within seven months is unheard of.

Gold has deep-rooted, cultural significance for Indians. We may speak different languages, have different cultures and backgrounds, but every single one of us understands the language of gold. Indian homemakers have more gold reserves than the Indian central bank or even the US. I'm <a href="https://blog.novemgold.com/interesting-fact-indian-housewives-hold-11-of-the-worlds-gold/">not</a> <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/market/commodities/shining-bright-indias-household-gold-reserves-touches-25k-tonne-over-40-of-gdp/1583058/">making</a> <a href="https://www.fortuneindia.com/macro/india-in-global-gold-buying-spree-rbi-2nd-largest-buyer-of-yellow-metal/107043">this up</a>. 2) No KYC requirements to invest in gold (up to a certain threshold). This is the most important aspect - without KYC requirements, a user can be converted from downloading an app to investing within 45 seconds! This was Jar's biggest advantage. Jar is the "<a href="https://superhuman.com">Superhuman</a>" for investing and saving.</p><p>With this unique insight, the founders of Jar found their habit forming "wedge" and made sure they doubled down on it.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2d84454-0578-4f3f-b081-e019cdeeff98_1000x591.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2d84454-0578-4f3f-b081-e019cdeeff98_1000x591.jpeg" width="548" height="323.868" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f2d84454-0578-4f3f-b081-e019cdeeff98_1000x591.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:591,&quot;width&quot;:1000,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:548,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Advertising Opinions: Mutual Funds Sahi Hai&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Advertising Opinions: Mutual Funds Sahi Hai" title="Advertising Opinions: Mutual Funds Sahi Hai" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2d84454-0578-4f3f-b081-e019cdeeff98_1000x591.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2d84454-0578-4f3f-b081-e019cdeeff98_1000x591.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2d84454-0578-4f3f-b081-e019cdeeff98_1000x591.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2d84454-0578-4f3f-b081-e019cdeeff98_1000x591.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Screenshot of ads from Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Most Indian wealth startups target more evolved investors. Even today they have ads that feature middle aged men with the message "<em>mutual funds sahi hai</em>" (mutual funds are good). There&#8217;s nothing wrong with that campaign but it leaves out younger investors. There was a huge blue ocean to target the aspirational, first-time-investor Gen Z who's thirst for instant gratification could not be quenched by any existing financial app. Jar filled that void - it gave users an easy way to invest instantly in a familiar asset, without the cognitive load. No more thinking of which fund or stock, what AuM, expense ratios, fund manager, fundamentals - none of that. Just plain ol' gold.</p><p>I'll never forget that in one of our early conversations with Nishchay and Misbah, co founders of Jar, I asked them what they considered as risks to their business (such a typical VC!). Without any hesitation, Nishchay replied - "<em>not being able to execute fast enough</em>". At the time I thought - "<em>that's stupid, that's not answer, they're clearly not thinking deep enough about this problem</em>". After all these months, it dawned on me - I am the stupid one. Out execution <em>is</em> their biggest moat. In the time that I've gotten to know them, I've seen that this team is unlike any other - Misbah and Nishchay are execution beasts. They're humble enough to take time and listen to all the gyaan their investors (including I) give them, but they always have an ear on the ground - listening, more importantly, to what their users and data have to say. Other startups can and will copy everything else about Jar, but not this team's drive to always out execute.</p><p><strong>Well, but Jar grew in a bull market</strong>: Yes, absolutely. Every single wealth product saw massive growth in users in 2021. In fact, in the <a href="https://fintechinside.substack.com/p/fintech-inside-30-25th-jul-2021-work">30th Edition of Fintech Inside in July, 2021</a>, I wrote about how the 2021 bull market has done more for investor awareness than the mutual fund industry's ad campaign. As of Jun, 2021, unique Indians investing in mutual funds doubled to 24mm between 2017 to 2021. Moreover, total unique mutual fund investors added in the quarter ended Jun, 2021 was 1.2mm whereas those added in all of FY21 (Apr-20 to Mar-21) was 2mm!</p><p>Ever since the robo-advisory boom and bust in 2016, the wealth management industry has been about expanding the market - not deepening it. This is clear from the 24mm unique investors. Indians earning more than INR 25,000 ($333) a month are in the <a href="https://fintechinside.substack.com/p/fintech-inside-31-1st-aug-2021-middle">top 1% of India</a>. There's not a lot of wealth. SIP's were created to lower that investment barrier, with current minimum investment of INR 100 ($1.3). Compare that to Jar - 4mm users, investing amounts as low as INR 1. Jar is truly expanding this market.</p><p>Given the above, my running thesis is - if and when there is a market correction, users might withdraw their investment from every other asset class (scare of losses), except gold. And Jar will continue to grow, even in that bear market. I do not have data to support my thesis so don't take my word for it.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94e12828-db0c-4573-bfbc-a3fe0d386e31_1920x1080.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94e12828-db0c-4573-bfbc-a3fe0d386e31_1920x1080.jpeg" width="474" height="266.625" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/94e12828-db0c-4573-bfbc-a3fe0d386e31_1920x1080.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:474,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94e12828-db0c-4573-bfbc-a3fe0d386e31_1920x1080.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94e12828-db0c-4573-bfbc-a3fe0d386e31_1920x1080.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94e12828-db0c-4573-bfbc-a3fe0d386e31_1920x1080.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94e12828-db0c-4573-bfbc-a3fe0d386e31_1920x1080.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Courtesy: Jar&#8217;s blog</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>What is the future for Jar?</strong> In the <a href="https://fintechinside.substack.com/p/fintech-inside-22-27th-feb-2021-cred">CRED deep dive</a> edition, I mentioned how CRED found its wedge in credit card bill payments, in the process gained users trust and is now offering a whole suite of lifestyle products.

A big reason for that is credit cards can only be issued by a bank. Everyone that wants to issue a credit card has to have a partner bank and issue a "co-branded" card. Slice*, OneCard, Uni and every other fintech startup and non-bank entities, that issue credit cards has one or more bank partners as "issuing bank". Federal Bank and SBM Bank are mostly likely the "issuing bank" partner to these startups. SBI Card is the only exception in the industry where the credit card is issued by a non-bank, except it comes with the brand and blessing of SBI Bank, India's largest public bank.</p><p>Given the above constraints, the news that RBI is considering allowing non-bank financial companies to issue cards is massive. There's been some chatter for some time that RBI is considering a new credit card regulation, but that hasn't happened yet. But if this is true, it will open up the credit card market in India like we've never seen before. It will also foster further innovation in the market - the way <a href="https://www.uni.cards/">Uni has with its Pay 1/3rd card</a>, or Slice* with it's <a href="https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/slice-launches-card-with-credit-limit-starting-at-rs-2000-11631090442727.html">INR 2,000 ($27) credit limit card</a>. It may even open up new use cases that the industry globally hasn't seen before.</p><p>Before we get ahead of ourselves though, IMO, RBI will not open up this credit card market market - at least to the larger ecosystem. It might allow just 2-3 very large NBFC's, with low risk tolerance. Remember the digital instant loan micro-bubble of 2019/2020 that kinda burst? RBI is still to trust fintech startups and NBFC's in that sector. It slowed down issuing NBFC licenses altogether since 2020, not sure if they've started that again. Moreover, the RBI would certainly want to avoid <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/4-arrested-in-icici-loan-death-case/story-mAMIPkmkbDsXl7BP9zH8oN.html">2007's credit card collection agency harassment</a> situation. So, I guess, till then, Indian fintech startups will have no choice but to partner with banks. Thankfully startups like Card91* and Hyperface are building that infrastructure to make it easy for anyone to issue cards.</p><p><strong>2&#65039;&#8419; Razorpay's global ambitions</strong></p><p><strong>Razorpay </strong><a href="https://blog.razorpay.in/razorpay-acquires-leading-malaysian-fintech-startup-curlec/">acquired </a><strong>Curlec</strong>, a Malaysian recurring payments startup, for $19mm. This is Razorpay's first acquisition internationally but more importantly this is Razorpay's first step to expanding globally - starting with Southeast Asia. In Razorpay's words - "<em>At Razorpay, we believe that with our experience of operating in a market as diverse as India, we&#8217;re ready to solve these problems globally.</em>"</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>: Impressive move, Razorpay. Zac and Steve, co-founders of Curlec, are exceptional. Curlec is a recurring payments platform in Malaysia. As far as I know, Curlec has partnered and integrated with large Malaysian banks - tough task in any country. This acquisition therefore gives Razorpay a head start in SEA and a bunch of heavy lifting solved for.</p><p>What's more interesting is Razorpay's choice of Malaysia for expansion. IMO, this is the smartest move - Malaysia's payments market is not as competitive as other's in the region, Indonesia is fairly competitive and would not have allowed Razorpay an easy entry there, Malaysia is also a big e-commerce market - $21bn in 2021 (per Razorpay), it's a market with higher GDP/capita and many more. It will allow Razorpay to build a brand and then expand to other markets in the region.</p><p>Razorpay also joins Open (SMB banking), Zeta (banking infrastructure) and Pine Labs (payments) in Southeast Asia. Anmol (tweet below) thinks Razorpay will beat Stripe in SEA. I agree with him for all other markets in SEA except Indonesia.</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/anmolm_/status/1491255753268928514?s=20&amp;t=ydsikBfwn3-CQPnOazB6sw&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Hot take- Razorpay is going to beat out Stripe to the SEA market over the next few years &quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;anmolm_&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Anm&#9678;l (&#128736;, &#127470;&#127475;)&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Wed Feb 09 03:40:52 +0000 2022&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Excited to announce @Razorpay's first international acquisition of Malaysian fintech startup @curlec_pay and welcoming @stevekucia, @zacliew &amp;amp; the entire team to Razorpay family.\n\nhttps://t.co/jmRLFToHzP&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;harshilmathur&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Harshil Mathur&quot;},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:1,&quot;like_count&quot;:117,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null}"><a href="https://twitter.com/anmolm_/status/1491255753268928514?s=20&amp;t=ydsikBfwn3-CQPnOazB6sw" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-user-avatar" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/twitter_name/w_36/anmolm_.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @anmolm_"><span class="tweet-author-name">Anm&#9678;l (&#128736;, &#127470;&#127475;) </span><span class="tweet-author">@anmolm_</span></div>Hot take- Razorpay is going to beat out Stripe to the SEA market over the next few years <div class="quoted-tweet"><p><span class="quote-tweet-name">Harshil Mathur </span><span class="quote-tweet-username">@harshilmathur</span></p>Excited to announce @Razorpay's first international acquisition of Malaysian fintech startup @curlec_pay and welcoming @stevekucia, @zacliew &amp;amp; the entire team to Razorpay family.

There was a lot of news and updates this past week. Head on over to <a href="https://thisweekinfintech.substack.com/p/this-week-in-fintech-asia-12th-feb">This Week in Fintech Asia</a>, another newsletter I author, to catch up on the latest.</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>: In <a href="https://fintechinside.substack.com/p/fiftythree">last week's edition</a> I complained that fintech startup news was dying down. Guess I spoke too soon! In India, startups across wealth, crypto, SMB finance, consumer finance and insurance announced raising funds. Obviously Polygon's fund raise announcement was huge! Polygon is not technically in fintech but thought it's important to highlight because Polygon is the world's largest Ethereum scaling company. It boasts of 7,000+ decentralised apps (dApps), including DeFi projects of Aave, Curve, Sushiswap and more, used by 1+mm users. This news is also important as it helps India make its mark in the world's crypto stage. Globally there are only 18+K crypto developers and hopefully Indian developers will lead its growth.</p><p>Startups that raised funding include: SMB finance - Mintifi, U GRO Capital and Karbon Card, Wealth - Wealthy*, GoalTeller and Dvara SmartGold, Insurance - Nova Benefits, Crypto - Polygon, Mudrex and Colexion, and in Consumer Finance - Nira and LegalPay. Not to forget, acquisitions by Razorpay and Pine Labs.</p><p>Southeast Asian startups were not too far behind. Very large amounts were raised by startups in countries that aren't known to have depth - maybe this is that inflection point needed. Philippine neo bank Tonik raised $131mm from Japan's Mizuho Bank. PDAX, a Philippine digital asset exchange raised $50mm. The more interesting thing to note is the fintech infrastructure being built. Two startups - Brick in Indonesia and IIMMPACT in Malaysia raised $8mm and $2mm respectively. Fintech infra is still nascent in SEA and it's great to see startups building here.</p><div><hr></div><blockquote><h2>&#127759; International</h2></blockquote><p><strong>Looking for the news digest? </strong>Read all the week&#8217;s fintech news and updates in India and SEA over at <a href="http://asia.thisweekinfintech.com">This Week in Fintech - India and SEA Edition</a>.</p><div><hr></div><blockquote><h2>&#127991;&#65039; Other Notable Nuggets</h2></blockquote><ol><li><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/06/technology/helium-cryptocurrency-uses.html?smid=tw-share">Maybe There&#8217;s a Use for Crypto After All</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/press-releases/2022/frbb-and-mit-open-cbdc-phase-one.aspx">The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and Massachusetts Institute of Technology release technological research on a central bank digital currency</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://tigerfeathers.substack.com/p/crypto-in-india">Crypto in India</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://marginaleconomist.com/india-blog-2/">Full Steam Ahead!

Crypto funds under management have increased multifold from just under $5 bn in 2017 to $60 bn in 2022. Hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds, and pension funds have all been accumulating cryptocurrencies. Behemoths like Black Rock, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Soros Fund Management, BNY Mellon, and many others have been active transacting in the crypto sector, especially over the last two years.</p><p>However, the general perception around crypto investment is based on limited awareness. Although one can easily buy and sell crypto assets today, there is no regularization and supervision that can protect traders from frequent price manipulation and fraud.</p><p>Institutional investors and professional investors account for less than 5% of traders in this space but account for more than 85% of market trading activity. High price volatility can keep a wary retail investor away. However, there are opportunities to invest through stable coins, for example USDC, Tether, and more, that are free from price fluctuations and can be leveraged to earn steady returns. Stable coins play a significant role across the ecosystem of the centralized finance "CeFi" and the decentralized finance or "DeFi" space; stable coins grew over 385% in 2021, increasing their circulation from $30 bn to over $140 bn by the year-end.</p><p>What if you are bullish on cryptocurrencies in the long term and want exposure after the rise of Bitcoin but unsure about the intricacies involved and how to go about investing? Is there a way of investing in crypto assets, earn an yield with low risks without actually trading in cryptocurrencies?</p><p>Fortunately, yes there are ways!</p><h4><strong>Ways to Invest Indirectly in Cryptocurrencies</strong></h4><p><strong>Earning passive income from crypto investment: </strong>Passive exposure to crypto investment is one of the best ways to earn steady returns from cryptocurrencies without falling prey to the risks associated with direct investment. Although limited, some crypto investment apps offer investors a product to earn steady returns or passive income by investing their money in stable coins like Tether (USDT), or USD Coin (USDC). There are a few startups coming up these days that help you ride the upside of crypto passively, without having to go through the complexity. Pioneered by BlockFi in the US, a bunch of projects for example Celsius, Nexi, Vauld, Flint, Pillow etc. have launched with their own value props. Flint, for example, converts the pooled funds into stable cryptocurrencies and lends it out to carefully chosen institutional borrowers, and also diversifies into DeFi protocols to generate returns on idle cash.</p><p><strong>Investing in companies holding cryptocurrencies: </strong>There are many listed companies that hold a substantial chunk of crypto assets. It signifies that these companies are very bullish on cryptocurrencies' future. For example, Tesla-founder Elon Musk revealed in February 2021 that the company had bought Bitcoin, showcasing that firms were willing to try and onboard cryptocurrencies onto their balance sheets. As of mid-Dec 2021, Tesla held around $1.31 bn in digital assets, which is almost 2.5% of the company's total assets. You can use this as a buffer and invest in buying stocks of these companies.</p><p>The catch, however, is that you will be earning from the stock valuation of these companies and not directly from the crypto assets they are holding. For example, you will earn capital gains as Tesla's stock price rises even when there is nothing favorable from the digital asset the company is holding. Furthermore, if the price of the cryptocurrency rises, this will increase the valuation of Tesla's stock, ultimately turning out to be a profit on your investment. Others that are traded on US stock exchanges include Microstrategy, which holds over 125,000 BTC, Square holding 8,027 BTC, Meitu holding 940 BTC, and many more.</p><p>Here is an overview of the stocks' performance of the top crypto-holding companies:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa19f92c-6c81-4ffa-8643-106849bcbb9e_945x318.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa19f92c-6c81-4ffa-8643-106849bcbb9e_945x318.png" width="474" height="159.5047619047619" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fa19f92c-6c81-4ffa-8643-106849bcbb9e_945x318.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:318,&quot;width&quot;:945,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:474,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is image-1.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is image-1.png" title="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is image-1.png" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa19f92c-6c81-4ffa-8643-106849bcbb9e_945x318.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa19f92c-6c81-4ffa-8643-106849bcbb9e_945x318.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa19f92c-6c81-4ffa-8643-106849bcbb9e_945x318.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa19f92c-6c81-4ffa-8643-106849bcbb9e_945x318.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Many of these companies that have a large amount of cryptocurrency holding at their disposal are not even directly involved in the crypto industry, at least not how they started. For example, Tesla is primarily an EV maker, and MicroStrategy Inc. deals mainly in business intelligence software.</p><p><strong>Publicly Traded ETFs: </strong>The demand for crypto ETFs is increasing day by day. As of now, we have several blockchain and crypto-based ETFs to invest in and many are on their way. Such ETFs, based on blockchain, i.e. Crypto Futures, or even Crypto Assets, are still correlated to crypto market risks. For example, we have ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which is a bitcoin-linked ETF scheme and gives investors the opportunity and exposure to Bitcoin returns in an easy and convenient way.</p><p>You can also invest in blockchain ETFs if you want to keep direct market risks at bay. Blockchain ETFs are funds that invest in companies investing/working in blockchain technologies.

GPUs are one of the essential components of cryptocurrency mining. Miners use high-performing or specialized GPUs to complete blockchain transactions and mint digital currencies.

Investing according to your risk appetite is very important while putting money in the crypto market. It is generally advised to start with smaller amounts and see which investment instrument or method is allowing you to grow your money.

Enjoy, instead, the only topic that made waves.</em>)</p><p><strong>1&#65039;&#8419; Virtual Digital Assets are not legal in India, but also not illegal</strong></p><p>India's finance minister at her Budget for 2022 speech, <a href="https://inc42.com/features/explained-everything-you-need-to-know-about-indias-30-crypto-tax-budget-2022/">announced a proposal</a> to introduce: 1) a 30% tax on income from Virtual Digital Assets (VDA), 2) a 1% TDS on transfer of these assets in the hands of the buyer, and 3) Introduction of a "Digital Rupee" via the Indian central bank. The proposal is expected to come into effect from 1st April, 2022. VDA includes cryptocurrencies and NFT's.</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>:</p><p><strong>On legality</strong>: This is a bittersweet moment for Indian crypto community. On one hand - this is the only time the government has acknowledged cryptocurrencies formally. There has been talk of a crypto law for some time now, but nothing's happened so far. I'd rely on this event for a direction only. On the other hand - the government merely acknowledging something, less so by taxing it, does not make it legal. So technically, cryptocurrencies are not legal in India.</p><p><strong>On taxation</strong>: The Indian government, by putting a 30% tax rate on income from sale of Virtual Digital Assets (VDA), has put trading in these digital assets at par with lotteries, horse race betting and more. IMO, that's not a good sign. Aside from the tax rate being prohibitively high, being likened to a "game of skill" will further put VDA's in a regulatory grey area. In any exchange, "traders" are typically few in number but easily account for 70-85% of transaction volumes. The tax rate, without any deductions or set offs, will dissuade traders from trading in India. This might actually be a deterrent for traders and therefore be problematic for the growth of these exchanges. If you really want to be optimistic about this crypto tax, you could probably stretch your imagination to think that, directionally, the government supports Exchanges and could potentially allow stock exchanges/brokers to support digital assets as well. Imagine buying Ethereum on Zerodha. In the <a href="https://fintechinside.substack.com/p/thirtynine">39th Edition of Fintech Inside</a>, I proposed that digital asset exchanges should be structured as the yet to be launched &#8220;Gold Spot Exchange&#8221; (GSE) in India. </p><p>Under the garb of wanting to track transactions, the government is further imposing a 1% TDS on all "transfers" in the hands of the seller on the total amount of the "transfer". As <a href="https://twitter.com/ThatNaimish/status/1488789108080078849">this twitter thread</a> posits, this TDS is easier to navigate if the buyer and seller are resident Indians, what if the buyer is non-Indian? Moreover, given all of this happens on the blockchain and users are typically anonymous, how will one identify nationality? I suppose implementing this crypto tax is going to be a nightmare for everyone involved.</p><p>When the crypto tax news broke out, <a href="https://twitter.com/os7borne/status/1488408789560840194?s=20&amp;t=oqMJGVFg09xPj4vqkjTOEA">I tweeted</a> if this if it is indeed going to legitimise crypto in India or is this just a way for the government to take their pound of flesh from this booming sector. Why ban something when you can earn taxes from it, I guess.</p><p><strong>On the digital rupee</strong>: The Budget speech mentioned that the Indian central bank is expected to start pilot testing a digital rupee as early as this quarter. It didn't have any further details about the digital rupee. Technically, there was nothing new. This same announcement was made by the Indian central bank (RBI) in July, 2021, although informally via a speech by the deputy governor. Even back then, the RBI just discussed it's various considerations at a very high level without offering any details. In the <a href="https://fintechinside.substack.com/p/fintech-inside-30-25th-jul-2021-work">Fintech Inside edition #30 as on July, 2021</a>, I covered the key considerations of this digital rupee:</p><p>"<em>This Digital Rupee will also be tested across retail and wholesale applications "with no disruptions". RBI says the main considerations for the roll out will be: 1. ledger technology - distributed or centralised, 2. validation mechanism - token based or account based, 3. distribution architecture - distributed by banks or RBI and, 4. degree of anonymity.</em>"</p><div><hr></div><blockquote><h2>&#127759; International</h2></blockquote><p><strong>LooksRare</strong>, an NFT marketplace, <a href="https://decrypt.co/91510/looksrare-has-reportedly-generated-8b-ethereum-nft-wash-trading">reportedly</a> saw $8.3bn of wash trading out of $9.5bn in total trading volume on the platform. <strong>VISA </strong><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/28/visa-says-crypto-linked-card-usage-hit-2point5-billion-in-its-first-quarter.html">claimed</a> that customers made $2.5bn in payments with its crypto-linked cards in its last quarter. <strong>Apple</strong> is <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/tech-news/apple-to-rival-square-by-turning-iphones-into-payment-terminals">working on a service</a> that will let businesses or users accept payments directly via the iPhone.</p><p><strong>Looking for the news digest? </strong>Read all the week&#8217;s fintech news and updates in India and SEA over at <a href="http://asia.thisweekinfintech.com">This Week in Fintech - India and SEA Edition</a>.</p><div><hr></div><blockquote><h2>&#127991;&#65039; Other Notable Nuggets</h2></blockquote><ol><li><p><a href="https://medium.com/@game_theorizing/of-smoke-and-mirrors-part-1-117c1f92e186">Of Smoke and Mirrors, Part 1</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.decentralised.co/on-tokenised-marketplaces/">On Tokenised Marketplaces</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/ifdp/files/ifdp1334.pdf">Stablecoins: Growth Potential and Impact on Banking</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.orfonline.org/research/a-proposed-architecture-for-a-central-bank-digital-currency-for-india/">A Proposed Architecture for a Central Bank Digital Currency for India</a></p></li></ol><div><hr></div><p>&#127925; <strong>Song on loop</strong></p><p>Discovered this fun song by Joe Jonas (<em>never thought I would recommend a Jonas song</em>) which is a soundtrack for the movie Rumble.

You'll find a nice surprise at the end of this post. This is not a sponsored post and neither am I nor EMVC an investor in Pillow.</em></p><p>Fintech has been a fast growing sector for as long as I can remember. I've been investing in fintech startups for a long time now and I still feel that fintech startups have barely scratched the surface of the larger financial services industry. Then came along this 18-year old founder in the crypto space, who was talking to me about DeFi and towards the end of the conversation called me a TradFi guy. TradFi, for almost everyone reading this, is Traditional Finance. Yes, TradFi includes those of us building in Fintech as well. I've never felt so outdated, while being in a sector I thought was at the bleeding edge.</p><p>Hi, fellow dinosaurs, join me in this quest of learning more about DeFi. There are a lot of pieces to cover about DeFi but for this Edition, I will only be covering DeFi investing, or ways in DeFi to generate a return on your investment.</p><p><strong>Disclaimers:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Fintech Inside is only meant for entertainment purposes and any content here should not be construed as education or investing advice. Please do your own research before investing in what you read in a newsletter.</p></li><li><p>This is a very high level, non-exhaustive, 101-style post. If you know your DeFi, this post is probably not for you. But I urge you to poke holes in it and let me know what I got wrong.</p></li><li><p>Yes, there's been a lot of editions about crypto recently. Will be covering a lot of it in the weeks to come. This is a complex, nuanced topic which I'm learning about, myself and hopefully helping you make sense of as well.</p></li></ol><p><strong>What is DeFi?</strong> DeFi is short for <strong>De</strong>centralised <strong>Fi</strong>nance. It's a financial sector reimagined, designed and built on blockchain technology. IMO, Blockchain technology is a system where there is no concentration of trust, trust (consensus mechanisms) is converted to a mathematical and computational construct. Our current TradFi systems place a lot of trust in institutions - central banks, banks, financial firms and more. DeFi aims to not have any of those centralised dependencies. DeFi is that promise of building new financial systems, inspired by the existing ones, but without the inefficiencies, exclusion, opacity and centralisation.</p><p><strong>How big is DeFi?</strong> DeFi is still a drop in the financial ocean. But&#8230; </p><ol><li><p>There are ~200-300mm crypto users globally. Of these, only <a href="https://mirror.xyz/mgiampapa.eth/T0qIfmrCnz9HefXHSpcGg-cIqy52mAXkhzpsNVLSSR4">~4mm unique addresses</a> have ever used a DeFi protocol. That's a sub-2% penetration.</p></li><li><p>As of end Jan-2022, a total <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-25/defi-shakeout-seen-as-liquidations-lead-to-crypto-user-exodus">150 DeFi apps held</a> $107bn in user funds, $30bn down from the start of 2022. In the past week, nearly $300mm was liquidated from these apps.</p></li></ol><p>These numbers tell you that DeFi is still in its early stages but there's a lot of traction with real billions of dollars being managed by these startups and projects.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45a52384-af81-4edc-ba02-665f5fa0e715_2892x3525.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45a52384-af81-4edc-ba02-665f5fa0e715_2892x3525.jpeg" width="266" height="324.27884615384613" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/45a52384-af81-4edc-ba02-665f5fa0e715_2892x3525.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1775,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:266,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Money vs dinosaur | ArtBUP - an international platform for Fine Art  Paintings&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Money vs dinosaur | ArtBUP - an international platform for Fine Art  Paintings" title="Money vs dinosaur | ArtBUP - an international platform for Fine Art  Paintings" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45a52384-af81-4edc-ba02-665f5fa0e715_2892x3525.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45a52384-af81-4edc-ba02-665f5fa0e715_2892x3525.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45a52384-af81-4edc-ba02-665f5fa0e715_2892x3525.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45a52384-af81-4edc-ba02-665f5fa0e715_2892x3525.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p><strong>Get to the good part already, how do I make money in DeFi?</strong> Hold your dinosaur paws! First, let's understand the ways to invest. There are several products you can invest in DeFi and start making a return. These products go from simple to very complex very quickly. They have the same concepts of TradFi e.g. P2P lending, mutual funds, derivatives, options, futures and more but the fudamental blocks of building the products are drastically different. For the purpose of this post, I'm not going to cover how these products function under the hood because honestly, I don't understand it yet.</p><p>The few DeFi product types where you can earn a return are:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Crypto Portfolios</strong>: This is a mutual fund/smallcase style basket investing. You can create your own basket and invest or you can invest in existing thematic baskets. These platforms automatically analyse your strategy and build your portfolios and trades on your behalf. Mudrex, an Indian startup, enables this style of investing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lending to Institutional Borrowers</strong>: As an individual investor, you can lend to an institution or another individual even with smaller sums. Startups that facilitate this, typically pool funds from many investors and lend to individuals against crypto collaterals or companies like Coinbase that use the funds for their trading businesses. There are many startups/protocols/projects that facilitate this. These loans are short term ones with attractive interest rates. You can access this avenue through platforms like Aave, Compound, Markets.xyz and more.</p></li><li><p><strong>Staking</strong>: As you've read above, blockchains replace centralised trust based structures. There are several methods in blockchain to replace this trust - <a href="https://medium.com/eximius-ventures/chapter-2-consensus-mechanisms-37928e869f4">here's a simple explainer on all those methods</a> (consensus mechanisms) by venture fund <a href="https://twitter.com/eximiusvc/">Eximius</a>. Staking is one such method where block validator locks in their coins to gain the right to validate transactions. As a reward, the validator gains coins. Staking also thus provides a return. Ethereum, in its second version, popularised this method and is a popular smart contract, layer one protocol. This topic can get complex real quick and there's a lot of detail I didn't mention. There are too many platforms that facilitate investing and getting a return by staking.</p></li><li><p><strong>Derivatives</strong>: DeFi derivatives are *highly* technical. To be honest, I don't understand a lot of it. I'm not going to pretend I understand it. You can instead read about <a href="https://jumpcrypto.com/state-of-crypto-derivatives-market/">DeFi derivatives from this *excellent* report</a> or this <a href="https://mirror.xyz/0x0C23E0dE114d28112f52203cb9583B9826b05dDe/8W5T5qFJerprS92FCF9858HFU-juoqoLJFwdEaH2re4">*excellent* rambling</a>. Platforms like <a href="https://opyn.co">squeeth</a>, <a href="https://zeta.markets/">zeta</a>, <a href="https://invariant.app/">invariant</a>, and <a href="https://01.xyz">01protocol</a> can help you get invested in DeFi derivatives.</p></li><li><p><strong>Money manager</strong>s: This is the exciting type. These money manager platforms are those that make investing in DeFi easy for us TradFi dinosaurs. You don't need metamask wallets, you don't need to analyse crypto coin performance, you don't need to understand derivatives or any of that hairy crypto stuff. These platforms "manage" your money for you, without any lock ins and give you a relatively secure return. These platforms pool user funds and automatically invest it in various protocols to your stabilise returns. <a href="https://www.pillow.fund/">Pillow</a> and <a href="https://www.flint.money">Flint</a> are two Indian startups building such products.</p></li></ol><p>If you plan to deploy your funds in DeFi, just remember, it comes with its own challenges. First, you need to have money to make money. <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/">Gas fees</a> on Ethereum are prohibitively high, which means you need to invest larger amounts for the returns to make any sense. Secondly, a lot of the DeFi hype grew in a year where even a fool could have made money. One market correction, and who's to say how much DeFi will be impacted. In just the past week, Bitcoin <a href="https://www.livemint.com/market/cryptocurrency/cryptocurrency-prices-today-plunged-check-bitcoin-ether-dogecoin-solana-cardano-latest-rates-11643257533685.html">plummeted 50%</a> from its November peak. Lastly, don't think we can expect regulations for these products anytime soon.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/davegutteridge/"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b96a8c0-7e29-4370-b3f1-bd1786113ad4_640x877.jpeg" width="326" height="446.721875" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2b96a8c0-7e29-4370-b3f1-bd1786113ad4_640x877.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:877,&quot;width&quot;:640,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:326,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;r/btc - As requested, a picture of a dinosaur holding Bitcoin, while mammals are poised to adapt for the future&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/davegutteridge/&quot;}" class="sizing-normal" alt="r/btc - As requested, a picture of a dinosaur holding Bitcoin, while mammals are poised to adapt for the future" title="r/btc - As requested, a picture of a dinosaur holding Bitcoin, while mammals are poised to adapt for the future" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b96a8c0-7e29-4370-b3f1-bd1786113ad4_640x877.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b96a8c0-7e29-4370-b3f1-bd1786113ad4_640x877.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b96a8c0-7e29-4370-b3f1-bd1786113ad4_640x877.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b96a8c0-7e29-4370-b3f1-bd1786113ad4_640x877.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">u/davegutteridge</figcaption></figure></div><p>There's a long way to go for DeFi to become just Fi. We're only just starting to see some directional use cases that have become large enough. As a generation, will we leapfrog fintech and directly implement DeFi? I guess, there's still some time to be able to say that with conviction. However we cannot ignore the opportunity in front of us.

Vyapar is the only startup which has firmly stuck with charging SMB's a subscription fee for the SaaS product as opposed to everyone else who gives it away for free. Today, it claims to have 100K+ paying SMB's - whoever said that Indian SMB's don't pay! The IndiaMart investment and partnership could have helped but I wouldn't give IndiaMart too much credit for this.</p><p>The stock broking business has long been touted as Zerodha's game to win and rightly so. Zerodha changed the game and gave us that "delta 4" experience in stock investing. Few thought that any business could challenge Zerodha's dominance, no one thought that there's any more innovation possible in the sector - not even Nithin Kamath. Then came Pravin Jadhav who conceptualised the stock brokerage business at PaytmMoney and then went on to start Raise which launched its stock broking product Dhan. With 100K+ registered users, Dhan is far from toppling Zerodha (7+mm registered users), but it has created a mark for itself among traders with its blazing fast app, several new industry-first features and much more. Dhan seems to be focused on traders and not the masses, which is also great as we know that majority of the revenue for brokerages come from trading. Excited to see how this plays out.</p><p>Special mention of the DeFi investment startups - Pillow and Flint, that announced their fund raises. Both function in slightly different ways at the backend, but give returns of 13-18% on invested capital. Do try them out!</p><p><strong>2&#65039;&#8419; South East Asian regulators getting busy</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>OJK</strong>, Indonesia's financial services authority, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/indonesia-regulator-says-financial-firms-banned-facilitating-crypto-sales-2022-01-25/">has banned</a> financial firms from facilitating cryptocurrency sales.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bank Indonesia</strong>, Indonesia's central bank, <a href="https://fintechnews.sg/58772/indonesia/bank-indonesia-launches-its-first-real-time-payments-infrastructure-with-aci-worldwide/">launched</a> its first real time payments infrastructure BI-FAST.</p></li><li><p><strong>Thailand's regulator</strong> is <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/thai-eyes-crypto-regulation-payment">planning to introduce</a> regulations for crypto payments.</p></li><li><p><strong>BSP</strong>, the Philippine central bank, <a href="https://opengovasia.com/the-philippines-central-bank-expects-digital-transactions-to-continue-rapid-growth/">reported</a> 53% adult Philippinos owned e-Money accounts in 2021, compared to 29% in 2019 and expects 70% adults to have bank accounts by 2023.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: Regulators the world over seem to be struggling to regulate cryptocurrencies. They're not alone though, not many people understand the benefits and challenges of this new industry. As per Reuters, $~60bn of crypto assets were traded in Indonesia in 2021 up from $4bn in 2020. From my very brief reading of the situation, it's a little confusing - the OJK has banned financial firms from facilitating crypto trade, but crypto asset trade is allowed in Indonesia on the commodities exchange and trading is supervised by the trade ministry and the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency. This ministry is currently working on a separate digital asset bourse called the Digital Futures Exchange, expected to be launched this quarter. All this while, Indonesia's top religious council <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisakim/2021/11/11/cryptocurrency-is-unlawful-for-muslims-indonesias-top-religious-council-says/?sh=646d11d43966">said that</a> crypto payments and trade is unlawful for Muslims. Indonesia seems to be as confused as us in India. <em>(if I've got some aspect of Indonesia's crypto regulation wrong, please <a href="mailto:connect@osborne.vc">write to me</a>)</em></p><p>Indonesia's long awaited real time payments platform - BI FAST was launched this week. Indonesian payments platforms have been studying the impact of this platform on their businesses for some time. They've been taking a leaf from India's payments ecosystem reaction to UPI's launch to prepare their own businesses from becoming obsolete. Except, BI FAST is not built like UPI. BI FAST is built on ACI Worldwide's payment backend allowing it UPI-like capability. Currently 20 banks are live on BI FAST. All this while Thailand announced that it will introduce regulations for crypto-based payments. Thailand will be the only (that I can think of) Asian country to say that it's cool with crypto-based payments. Thailand's progressive view of cryptocurrencies is a fascinating topic that is seldom written about. I'm unable to put my finger on why the financial industry of this little country is obsessed with digital assets. If you have access to any report on the topic, I'd love to read it.</p><p><em>The week was not as eventful as the weekend (<a href="https://twitter.com/AditiS90/status/1487409915799162882?s=20&amp;t=6Gnj7CjBdRqG3IKG_cOJ6A">Ashneer Grover saga continues</a>) so there're only two top news for the week.</em></p><p>&#127873; <strong>BONUS: About El Salvador, the IMF and Incentives</strong></p><p>In September, 2021, El Salvador became the first country to recognise Bitcoin as legal tender. This meant that Bitcoin could officially be used to pay for goods and services across the country. The tiny Latin American country with a population of ~7mm suddenly became centre of attention in the global cryptocurrency debate. The President then announced that the country will issue a billion dollar bitcoin-backed bond to raise funds for the country and trade in bitcoin. This drew a lot of attention especially from central banks worldwide.</p><p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF), seemed to have had a serious problem with this. After making some comments that the volatility of bitcoin will adversely impact the stability of the country, the IMF seems fed up and is now resorting to arm twisting. IMF in its <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2022/01/25/pr2213-el-salvador-imf-executive-board-concludes-2021-article-iv-consultation">recent statement</a>, said it "<em>urged the authorities to narrow the scope of the Bitcoin law by removing Bitcoin's legal tender status</em>..." "...<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-25/imf-board-urges-el-salvador-to-ditch-bitcoin-as-legal-tender">stressing that it would be difficult to get a loan from the institution.</a>". El Salvador has a pending loan disbursal of $1.3bn from the IMF.</p><p>Very curious to see how the President of El Salvador reacts to this notification and if the IMF will get its way.</p><p>If you're interested, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/podcasts/the-breakdown-with-nlw/el-salvadors-battle-with-the-imf-is-bigger-than-bitcoin/">here's an interesting take</a> (<em>15mins, audio</em>) by CoinDesk about the entire situation where it says that Bitcoin's influence on El Salvador in the media is overstated and Bitcoin reserves are only 2% of the total reserves of the country and hence the IMF is being unreasonable.</p><div><hr></div><blockquote><h2>&#127759; International</h2></blockquote><p>The <strong>IMF's board</strong> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-25/imf-board-urges-el-salvador-to-ditch-bitcoin-as-legal-tender">has urged</a> El Salvador to strip Bitcoin off legal currency status.

You might have noticed it by the increasing number of brands announcing they were entering the <a href="https://tigerfeathers.substack.com/p/welcome-to-the-metaverse">Metaverse</a>. Or by the increasing number of your friends who became overnight authorities on Solana, Matic and Dogecoin. Maybe it was the seemingly ridiculous sums of money being spent on virtual real estate. Maybe it was the hordes of NFT influencers invading your Instagram feed or the incessant advertisements from crypto exchanges that interrupted your cricket viewing.</p><p>Maybe it was the monkey pics.</p><p>Yeah, it was probably the monkey pics.</p><p>The &#8216;upgrade&#8217; I&#8217;m referring to, of course, is Web3. It was undoubtedly the biggest, frothiest (and possibly the most contentious) tech story to emerge in 2021. That&#8217;s because the tech itself wasn&#8217;t really new. But the packaging certainly was. Web3 is in many ways a branding makeover for all the philosophical underpinnings and technical promise of blockchains and crypto assets. It is shorthand for the next iteration of the Internet, one which offers the potential (and not the guarantee) of a more egalitarian future for Internet users. If you haven&#8217;t been keeping score, the &#8216;3&#8217; in Web3 signifies the third major chapter of the Internet story, one that aims to improve upon the achievements in the first two while correcting for the missteps we&#8217;ve made along the way.</p><h3><strong>.com</strong></h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8851ab76-10d2-48ea-b953-8983062b5300_1486x836.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8851ab76-10d2-48ea-b953-8983062b5300_1486x836.jpeg" width="1456" height="819" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8851ab76-10d2-48ea-b953-8983062b5300_1486x836.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Remember when Amazon only sold books? - Los Angeles TimesScreenshot of Amazon.com in 1990's (web1)&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Remember when Amazon only sold books? - Los Angeles TimesScreenshot of Amazon.com in 1990's (web1)" title="Remember when Amazon only sold books? - Los Angeles TimesScreenshot of Amazon.com in 1990's (web1)" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8851ab76-10d2-48ea-b953-8983062b5300_1486x836.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8851ab76-10d2-48ea-b953-8983062b5300_1486x836.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8851ab76-10d2-48ea-b953-8983062b5300_1486x836.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8851ab76-10d2-48ea-b953-8983062b5300_1486x836.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Screenshot of Amazon.com in 1990's (web1)</figcaption></figure></div><p>For the uninitiated, Web1 was the first epoch of the Internet that unfolded over most of the 1990s. It was characterised by the invention and proliferation of common standards and protocols that helped lay the interoperable foundations of the global information system we know as the World Wide Web today. These protocols were collectively governed by independent non-profit organisations made up of early Internet pioneers, which kept the nascent Web free from corporate capture or monopolisation. This era of the Internet wasn&#8217;t optimised for the average Internet user. You had to be somewhat technically literate to manoeuvre your way around this terrain because it consisted largely of crude building blocks as opposed to the slick user-friendly applications we&#8217;re accustomed to today. This meant that early web pages were made up of static media, leading to one-way relationships where average Internet users were limited to reading or consuming content instead of contributing it themselves.</p><p>This changed with Web2, or what would come to be known as the &#8216;Social&#8217; web. This era is responsible for the coronation of tech giants like Apple, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon and Google who would erect empires on the previously unconquered land of the Web, eventually replacing the open decentralised protocols with their own fortified walled gardens. The Internet was suddenly filled with dynamic web pages that invited users to like, tag, comment and share their thoughts with the world. The Web2 superpowers helped to expand the utility of the Internet beyond the domain of geeks, and in turn were rewarded with mammoth valuations and an outsized influence on our society. Their ascent was supercharged by the arrival of the smartphone, meaning that for the first time ever we carried the Internet around with us wherever we went.</p><p>The success of Big Tech was ultimately down to one thing &#8211; these companies are really, really good at what they do. It is no surprise then, that in the last 15 years Internet companies have become a fixture in our daily lives. They&#8217;ve given us the ability to shop online, to date online, to share ideas online, to find work online, to make and meet friends online. This chapter of the Web helped to evaporate geographical barriers between people and helped to digitise our social and economic lives. And in exchange for (often free) access to these sophisticated digital services, we volunteered the control of our personal data and online identities to a handful of omnipotent tech executives. We submitted to the algorithms.</p><p>These platforms trained us to surrender more and more of ourselves to unlock access to supposedly better services. For example, the more of your real-world identity you upload to Facebook, the more it will fill your newsfeed with products and content it thinks you might like. The more you shop on Amazon, the better your &#8216;recommended items&#8217; list will be. The more you interact with political content on Twitter, the deeper you will be ushered into an ideological echo chamber. We have grown accustomed to trading privacy for convenience when it comes to our online activities. This means we are now at the mercy of algorithms that use every trick in the book to keep us engaged and occupied in order to harvest our data to serve the interests of advertisers.</p><p>And that&#8217;s where things have gotten weird.</p><p>Legendary entrepreneur and VC Marc Andreessen frequently laments what he calls &#8216;The Internet&#8217;s Original Sin&#8217;. As the founder of Netscape, where he built the first commercially successful web browser (called Mosaic) in 1994, Andreessen often talks about how the lack of a native payments protocol for the Internet is what&#8217;s led us to the advertising-plagued mess we find ourselves in today. In the early days of Mosaic, the Netscape team wanted to integrate a provision for payments directly into the browser. The idea was that if you could incorporate a native payment functionality into the browsing experience, you could conceive of a more sustainable (and diverse) model for commerce on the Internet, one where users could directly pay for the information, content, goods and services that they liked.</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;This is the way the real world works &#8211; you know something is valuable because someone is willing to pay for it.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, the internet was still a strange commodity at the time. The money men didn&#8217;t know what to make of it. The banks, the credit card companies and other payment processors were all reluctant to jump headfirst into this brave new world (i.e. to work with Netscape), which suffocated the early potential for commerce on the Internet. Amazon had also been experimenting with its own native payment solution but it wasn&#8217;t till PayPal came along in 1999 that users could really transact online without the stress of having to share their credit card details with strangers on the Internet.</p><p>The failure to convince the banks to get on board meant that the Internet always contained a placeholder for a native payments protocol (it is also why we&#8217;ve had to navigate through a mess of clunky incompatible banking portals, card numbers and payment gateways to make an online payment for so many years until modern fintech solutions finally came along). Worse, it meant that advertising would become the default business model for Internet companies because it was the only monetisation route that didn&#8217;t require users to volunteer any sensitive financial data over the Web. It resulted in a whole host of downstream problems (&#8220;80%&#8221; of which could have been avoided) like user data mining, algorithmic manipulation, privacy violation, third-party ad networks, and a general misalignment of incentives between online platforms and their users.</p><p>For all the amazing ways the Social Web has transformed our lives in the last decade, it has left us reeling from the mess of advertising-dependent business models. Today Big Tech holds all the cards. Users have no control or ownership over their online identities i.e. Facebook, Youtube and Twitter could arbitrarily delete your account or boot you off their platforms if they determine you&#8217;ve violated some rule that you didn&#8217;t even know existed. Businesses on these platforms are at the mercy of algorithms that dictate how much user traffic is directed towards them, and how much revenue they can subsequently make. Users and entrepreneurs have very little say when it comes to the governance of the platforms that they invest so much time, money and effort in. The hallmark of the social web is user generated content, which has earned the tech companies untold riches with no compensation for the actual users that drive traffic on these social feeds. The need to draw eyeballs has made it paramount for tech companies to manipulate users and consolidate user data within individual silos, making it hard (or impossible) for users to seamless port their data, their history, their identities and their assets between platforms. The ills of Web2 boil down to an inability of users to view, edit and contribute to the databases that are centrally managed by corporate behemoths.</p><p>That&#8217;s where Web3 comes in.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7c19217-4486-49a9-96f7-d8d77e0ae3cd_740x324.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7c19217-4486-49a9-96f7-d8d77e0ae3cd_740x324.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a7c19217-4486-49a9-96f7-d8d77e0ae3cd_740x324.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:null,&quot;width&quot;:null,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7c19217-4486-49a9-96f7-d8d77e0ae3cd_740x324.png&quot;}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7c19217-4486-49a9-96f7-d8d77e0ae3cd_740x324.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7c19217-4486-49a9-96f7-d8d77e0ae3cd_740x324.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7c19217-4486-49a9-96f7-d8d77e0ae3cd_740x324.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7c19217-4486-49a9-96f7-d8d77e0ae3cd_740x324.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h3><strong>.BTC</strong></h3><p>As we&#8217;ve learned, many of the problems associated with Web2 are really collateral damage resulting from the lack of a native solution for transferring money over the Internet. This is no longer a problem waiting to be solved. In October 2008, in the wake of the financial crisis, a person (or group) by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto would lay the <a href="https://tigerfeathers.substack.com/p/the-most-innovative-technology-of">blueprint</a> for a native monetary system for the Internet, one that would allow people to send and receive money online without going through any central intermediary. This system, of course, was Bitcoin. Three months later Satoshi would release the open source code for the Bitcoin software which anyone in the world could inspect and download. Users that downloaded the software could join a network of computers all running the Bitcoin code, creating a peer-to-peer system for transferring money online that relied on the use of its own native currency - bitcoin. By creating a decentralised system (without intermediaries) specifically for the digital world, the process of sending money over the internet could theoretically resemble the process of sending an email &#8211; instant and virtually free. Just bits of data moving through cyberspace.</p><p>There were several reasons why this was such an important breakthrough. First, Satoshi essentially figured out a way for parties that didn&#8217;t know or trust each other to come to a consensus about the state of a database. The legacy financial system is based on the supremacy of financial middlemen like commercial banks, payment networks, clearing houses etc who each maintain central systems of record (i.e. central ledgers) to keep track of customer balances and transactions. These institutions traditionally fulfil the role of trusted intermediaries, helping transacting entities overcome counter-party risk and ensuring that the terms of any transaction are duly fulfilled. They earn a healthy fee for performing this service. In comparison, Satoshi proposed the use of a system of distributed ledgers, where each node on the network would maintain a record of transactions and account balances instead of some central authority. The genius of Satoshi&#8217;s design was in the enshrining of cryptography and game theory as the central pillars of the system. This meant that each participant on the network was incentivised to act in the best interest of the system i.e. each node was incentivised to maintain an accurate synchronous copy of the ledger. The information itself was secured by cryptography (the art of encoding and decoding information), making it easy to verify whether two disparate ledger copies were the same.</p><p>Thus, nodes on the network essentially perform the role of decentralised auditors (&#8216;miners&#8217;), helping to maintain the integrity of the ledger without the need for any governing entity. In exchange, they are rewarded in the form of the network&#8217;s native digital currency &#8211; bitcoin &#8211; which is issued on a pre-defined schedule. The currency itself has a fixed supply of 21 million which means that as more people use the network i.e. as the demand for the currency increases, the artificial scarcity (fixed supply) is designed to foster a positive price appreciation. This in turn incentivises more participants to join the network and to continue to maintain the accuracy of the ledger which in turn maintains the viability of the bitcoin as legitimate medium of exchange, unit of account and store of value. Magic.</p><p>Bitcoin unearthed a number of important technological developments and seminal ideas that would go on to form the backbone of the next Internet era (Web3):</p><ul><li><p>The concept of <strong>cryptocurrencies</strong> (or crypto assets or crypto tokens), units of software that can carry value over the Internet, which are created via code instead of being issued by central banks</p></li><li><p>Using a <strong>peer-to-peer</strong> <strong>system of distributed ledgers</strong> secured by cryptography as a decentralised accounting system for digital assets. This system is called a blockchain (because transactions are recorded in batches or &#8216;blocks&#8217;). A blockchain is essentially a way for parties that don&#8217;t trust each other to agree on the contents of a database or the state of a network or just a set of facts. The integrity and accuracy of the ledger is maintained by the consensus of network participants.</p></li><li><p>Bitcoin introduced the idea of <strong>provable digital scarcity</strong>. The Internet had reduced the marginal cost of replicating and sharing content down to zero. This makes it difficult to verify the authenticity of any single file or unit of media (eg: you could make infinite copies of a meme to share with your friends over email without anyone knowing which was the original file). However, because of bitcoin&#8217;s 21 million hard cap (that is enshrined in the bitcoin code) and the use of a blockchain to track the provenance and history of every token in the bitcoin network, you could now create natively digital assets that could hold value on the Internet because you had a way to validate its scarcity.</p></li><li><p>A blockchain effectively allows you to verify the authenticity and scarcity of a digital file. If provable digital scarcity can enable digital assets to hold and appreciate in value, then there is now merit in <strong>digital ownership</strong>. Bitcoin uses cryptographic techniques to secure identities and transactions on the network. Your identity on the network is pseudonymously represented (i.e. a unique of letters and numbers) and yours alone to manage, thanks to a cryptographically generated public key (i.e. your Bitcoin username) and private key (i.e. your Bitcoin password). No organisation can seize your assets or censor your transactions unless they have your private key. This means that you finally have a way to exercise autonomy and control over your identity on the internet outside of the reaches of any social media company or online administrator. Your keys, your coins, your identity.</p></li><li><p>The concept of <strong>decentralised governance</strong>. Anyone on the Internet can download the Bitcoin software. You don&#8217;t need anyone&#8217;s permission to join the Bitcoin network. There are over 100 million wallets currently on the Bitcoin network, out of which an overwhelming number of people have no idea who else is on the network. And yet they are able to coordinate harmoniously despite the absence of personal familiarity because they can supplant their trust in people with a trust in code i.e. each participant agrees to abide by the rules of the game. Bitcoin is the first example of <strong>trust-less, permission-less finance</strong> &#8211; anyone in the world with an internet connection can use the bitcoin network to send and receive money, safe in the knowledge that everyone else in the network is financially incentivised to behave in the best interests of the system.</p></li><li><p>And finally, the concept of <strong>programmable money </strong>- the idea that you could prescribe the rules of a monetary system and embed those into its source code (eg: Bitcoin&#8217;s 21 million limit, the reward schedule, the process of making transactions etc). This code executes on the satisfaction of pre-defined conditions without the need for lawyers or accountants or any other type of intermediary. These self-executing &#8216;contracts&#8217; embedded in code are known as <strong><a href="https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/idea.html">smart contracts</a></strong>. They are a way to create decentralised applications where the &#8216;rules of the game&#8217; are programmed into the network, which means that the system will keep working as intended as long as the prescribed terms of the contract are met.</p></li></ul><p>Depending on who you ask, Web3 is either an abstraction, an application, a contortion or an outright manipulation of the concepts described above. In the years since 2009, Bitcoin has attracted the attention of technologists, idealists, opportunists and ideologues from around the world who believe in the merits of a financial system that exists outside of state control, one which anyone with an Internet connection is free to join and participate, one that restores monetary sovereignty back to individuals instead of institutions. &#8216;Decentralisation&#8217; has emerged as a seductive proposition and a persuasive rallying cry for builders and users, a cause that is relatively easy to support but harder to faithfully implement (not for want of trying).</p><p>Therein lies Bitcoin&#8217;s most important contribution of all &#8211; it has given us ideas worth fighting for. This genie does not return to the lamp.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67e4d32c-9907-48cd-9d16-34077748cb54_1920x808.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67e4d32c-9907-48cd-9d16-34077748cb54_1920x808.png" width="662" height="278.7129120879121" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/67e4d32c-9907-48cd-9d16-34077748cb54_1920x808.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:613,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:662,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Home | ethereum.org&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Home | ethereum.org" title="Home | ethereum.org" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67e4d32c-9907-48cd-9d16-34077748cb54_1920x808.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67e4d32c-9907-48cd-9d16-34077748cb54_1920x808.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67e4d32c-9907-48cd-9d16-34077748cb54_1920x808.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67e4d32c-9907-48cd-9d16-34077748cb54_1920x808.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h3><strong>.eth</strong></h3><p>The ideas put forth by Satoshi have since been experimented on and expanded further. Entrepreneurs and engineers have attempted to apply the same concepts to use cases besides &#8216;money&#8217;, in the process launching an entire &#8216;crypto&#8217; industry that now boasts an undeniable intellectual and financial gravity.</p><p>In the last decade we&#8217;ve seen:</p><ul><li><p>the creation of general-purpose blockchain platforms like Ethereum (and others) that allow anyone to spin up their own <strong>decentralised applications</strong> with their own native tokens. These tokens are versatile instruments that can represent ownership, governance rights, property rights, future revenue and anything else that developers can dream up, potentially replacing websites as the atomic units of the Internet.</p></li><li><p>the proliferation of &#8216;<strong>token offerings</strong>&#8217; as a way to raise money for crypto projects where anyone in the world with an internet connection has the right to invest in the next big tech idea. Particularly significant is the ability for Internet users to have equity in the platforms they use and support from an early stage, instead of typically waiting to pick up scraps in a future IPO (as was the case for Web2)</p></li><li><p>the popularisation of a new token standard to represent unique digital assets known as <strong>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)</strong>. In comparison with bitcoin and other monetary systems where each unit of a currency is interchangeable with any other, an NFT is a way to prove the authenticity, ownership and provenance of unique digital goods. An NFT is a blockchain-based record of ownership for any kind of digital file (an image, video, meme, game item, document etc) that contributed to a &nbsp;<a href="https://li.substack.com/p/the-web3-renaissance-a-golden-age">renaissance of digital creativity</a> over the course of 2021.</p></li><li><p>the flourishing of an entire ecosystem for <strong>Decentralised Finance (DeFi)</strong>, where each of the components of the traditional financial system are being replicated for the internet via smart contracts built on blockchain-based platforms. This means, again, that anyone with an internet connection can trustless-ly and permissionless-ly borrow or lend their money to strangers on the Internet without any documentation or discrimination, safe in the knowledge that the smart contract will guarantee that the terms of any proposed agreement will be duly met as specified, and users are incentivised to be on their best behaviour.</p></li><li><p>the arrival of <strong>Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs)</strong> as a new way of coordinating people and resources over the Internet. Particularly in the last year, we&#8217;ve seen people all over the world come together (bound by contracts written in code, not paper) to pool and manage resources towards a specific goal like tackling <a href="https://www.klimadao.finance/">climate change</a>, <a href="https://www.flamingodao.xyz/">supporting creators</a>, or <a href="https://www.constitutiondao.com/">buying the Constitution of the United States</a>. There is merit in suggesting that DAOs could be a logical evolution of the joint stock company for the Internet.</p></li></ul><p>When people today say &#8216;Web3&#8217; they typically mean the ecosystem that encompasses the components mentioned above. Web3 broadly refers to the idea of a reimagined Internet, one that continues to provide the sophisticated services offered in Web2 while returning to the decentralised, interoperable foundations of Web1 through the use of blockchain-based technologies and crypto protocols. It is a vision of the Internet where the balance of power is restored to individual users who have complete privacy, ownership and control over their digital identities and their digital property (i.e. NFTs and other crypto assets) via the sole control of their private keys. It is &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201625590779909?s=20">an internet owned by the builders and users, orchestrated with tokens</a>&#8221;.</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Web3 is the world in which the code is open source instead of closed source, the users own their data instead of being the data, and the users and the contributors govern the network and own the network instead of a small number of shareholders owning the network&#8221; <br></em><strong>&#8211; Naval Ravikant</strong></p></blockquote><p>However the irony is, that for a technology based on the distributed consensus of strangers on the Internet, no one can actually agree on the definition of Web3. The public discourse has become stained by the tribalism from both proponents and opponents of crypto who argue on the linguistic boundaries of Web3 as well as its technological promises. Strangely enough, this is one of the quirks of having Web2 social platforms where we can debate the merits and shortcomings of Web3 all day. It is being constantly defined and redefined, litigated and castigated, all in real time.</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473139010197508098?s=20&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;You don&#8217;t own &#8220;web3.&#8221;\n\nThe VCs and their LPs do.

The VCs and their LPs do. It will never escape their incentives. It&#8217;s ultimately a centralized entity with a different label.

To him there is no Web3, only Bitcoin.</p><p>Cryptographers like Moxie Marlinspike (Former CEO &#8211; Signal) have offered <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">thoughtful critiques</a> on the technical underpinnings of Web3, pointing out that there are elements of Web3 infrastructure that still have centralised components, and others that insufficiently incorporate cryptography into their security practices.</p><p>While &#8216;Web3&#8217; as a convenient label has helped to soften the narrative blow that typically accompanies any discourse around &#8216;crypto&#8217;, there are still many issues that need to be addressed specifically around the scaling and accessibility of these technologies beyond crypto-literate and crypto-wealthy audiences before they can deliver on their lofty ambitions and justify often gaudy market valuations. This, unfortunately, will always be the nature of the game. As a 24/7 liquid trading market with constant price discovery, crypto can often a resemble a global casino where people are gambling on instruments that have no actual use. It is easy for outside observers to compare the token value of a project and the actual impact of that project and come away with the opinion that something stinks. That is understandable. That&#8217;s why there are still regulatory questions to be answered across the globe. But I&#8217;m hopeful that the strides made over the last 12 months have helped to validate the work and commitment of Web3 proponents who believe in a fundamentally better future for creators and consumers on the Internet.</p><h3><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong></h3><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Information that we assume to be public, we publish. Information that we assume to be agreed, we place on a consensus-ledger. Information that we assume to be private, we keep secret and never reveal.&#8221;<br></em><strong>- <a href="http://gavwood.com/dappsweb3.html">Gavin Wood</a></strong></p></blockquote><p>I first went down the bitcoin rabbit hole in 2015, and came out sufficiently radicalised. I&#8217;ve since tempered my own opinions on the necessity for absolute decentralisation to achieve all of crypto&#8217;s grand objectives. We don&#8217;t need to overthrow every central figurehead or intermediary to unlock a better future for the internet (or internet users). Not every feature of Web2 is bad, nor every outcome of Web3 noble. Not every technological problem requires a blockchain solution. Not all advertising models are evil. Not every facet of humanity needs to be financialised and tradable. Not every aspect of centralisation is toxic, nor every outcome of decentralisation desirable. I do believe, however, that we need to even the stakes. We need to safeguard the ultimate sovereignty of the individual, restoring control over personal data and identity back to people, and giving global citizens equal access (and not the obligation) to use open digital and financial infrastructure that <em>could</em> enrich their lives.</p><p>If you find yourself in the privileged segment of the world that has access to all the benefits of a functional economic and social system (and government), some of these objectives probably don&#8217;t move the needle for you. But the virtues of decentralisation often reveal themselves only in times of need.</p><p>You don&#8217;t need inflation-resistant money unless you live in a country where monetary mismanagement has resulted in a hyperinflationary currency that isn&#8217;t worth the paper its printed on.</p><p>You won&#8217;t understand the benefits of owning your online identity and assets till Facebook blocks your account for making a supposedly controversial political statement.</p><p>You won&#8217;t see the need to have a say in the governance of platforms you use, till they suddenly change the rules of the algorithm that determine how much money you make every month.</p><p>You might not see how the ability to create and market scarce digital goods will transform the fortunes of global artists who&#8217;ve typically had to rely on the benevolence and endorsement of traditional gatekeepers to get their work in front of an audience of potential patrons.</p><p>You won&#8217;t see the necessity for decentralised finance to protect and grow your wealth, till interest rates in your country fall to a point where you&#8217;re actually losing money by holding your savings in a bank.</p><p>You don&#8217;t understand why seizure-resistant and censorship-resistant money are important, till your bank account has been frozen by a national government gone rogue.</p><p>Decentralisation can often sound like a vapid rallying cry, but it is an indispensable <em>option</em> that everyone on the Internet deserves to have. Web3 is not about removing centralised platforms from the Internet, it is about reducing their absolute control over our digital lives. Its not about cutting VCs and bankers out of the system, its about letting everyone else in. Interoperable crypto protocols and cryptographically secured private keys mean that we can now own our identities and take them with us across the Internet, with complete control over who can access our data. Web3 is about reducing rent seeking and switching costs, shifting the balance of power from corporations and platforms to individual users. Web3 is the ownership layer of the internet disguised as the value layer.</p><p>Based on where you&#8217;re sitting, we&#8217;re either at the start of a new Internet era or right in the middle of it. There is plenty of work to be done on security, scaling, UX and consumer education to ensure that all citizens of the Internet have fair access to this new frontier. With great power will come great accountability. Web3 might mean different things to different people. But its worth remembering that we are moving from the age of the institution to the <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/power-to-the-person">age of the individual</a>. Crypto is enabling the autonomy and sovereignty of the individual at a global level by empowering the users and builders of the Internet to have a say in where it goes next. It is on us to ensure that we build in the right direction.</p><p><em><strong>About the Author:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/RahulSanghi1">Rahul Sanghi</a>&nbsp;most recently served as Fintech Lead for Visa in India &amp; South Asia.

Fintech startups raised $9+bn in funding over 360+ deals. For context that's a third of total funding raised by startups in India compared to a fourth in 2020. Fintech investments in 2021 was 3.2x that of 2020.</p><p>This mega funding year also minted several unicorns - 12 fintech unicorns and over 40 total unicorns in just 2021. Compare that to 26 total unicorns minted in the past decade! The 12 fintech unicorns are: <strong>CRED</strong> (credit cards rewards and marketplace), <strong>BharatPe</strong> (SMB payments and credit), <strong>Digit Insurance</strong> (insurance), <strong>Slice</strong> (consumer credit), <strong>Mobikwik </strong>(payments), <strong>Groww</strong> (stock trading and investing), <strong>Chargebee</strong> (recurring payments SaaS), <strong>Zeta</strong> (banking infrastructure), <strong>OfBusiness</strong> (SMB credit), <strong>CoinDCX</strong> (crypto exchange), <strong>CoinSwitch Kuber</strong> (crypto exchange), <strong>Acko</strong> (insurance).</p><p>BYJU's was not the only one acquiring startups. 2021 was a record year for fintech acquisitions! Starting with the mega acquisition - PayU India acquired BillDesk for $4.7bn. This acquisition was among India's largest and the largest acquisition in the fintech sector. Then there was CRED that acquired Happay for $180mm. By my count, there would be at least 40-50 acquisitions in India this year. History was made when BharatPe, a three-year old payments startup, was given approval to launch a bank! This is rare for Indian banking and more so for Indian fintech.</p><p>Most importantly, we saw the first ever IPO's for fintech startups. Paytm and Policybazaar listed on the Indian stock exchanges and that's huge. Their performance post listing has not been the best, but those companies listing is a leap forward for Indian fintech sector. Before this, IPO's were not even thought of as an exit route for investors. It has always been that clause that "needed to be there" in the investment documents. Now, there's precedent and IPO's can be considered a legit exit route.</p><p>In my opinion though, the fintech sector's biggest win this year is the grand migration to fintech startups. This includes people from other industries crossing over to fintech and professionals from traditional financial firms "taking the risk" and joining fintech startups. This exodus gives me so much hope for the fintech sector.</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/onlymadhoo/status/1453927180509925381?s=20&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;5 bankers in the past few weeks I&#8217;ve spoken to have quit the bank to join some Fintech &#129300;&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;onlymadhoo&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Madhusudanan&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Fri Oct 29 03:30:27 +0000 2021&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:2,&quot;like_count&quot;:67,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null}"><a href="https://twitter.com/onlymadhoo/status/1453927180509925381?s=20" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-user-avatar" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/twitter_name/w_36/onlymadhoo.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @onlymadhoo"><span class="tweet-author-name">Madhusudanan </span><span class="tweet-author">@onlymadhoo</span></div>5 bankers in the past few weeks I&#8217;ve spoken to have quit the bank to join some Fintech &#129300;</a><a href="https://twitter.com/onlymadhoo/status/1453927180509925381?s=20" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-footer"><p class="tweet-date">October 29th 2021</p><span class="retweets"><span class="rt-count">2</span> Retweets</span><span class="likes"><span class="like-count">67</span> Likes</span></div></a></div><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/rexsalisbury/status/1275112661504516097?s=20&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Why am I excited about fintech?

However, based on trends from the past year, I believe we can expect to see more of the following in 2022:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Super app-ification</strong>: Paytm and PhonePe have already begun their transformation to Fintech Super Apps. I believe we will see more of that happening in 2022. Startups that have anywhere over 100K users will start offering related financial products to become the one-stop super market for all their user's financial needs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Licenses will be more valuable</strong>: Fintech startups that raise/raised a lot of capital will reduce their dependence on a third party and build their own financial products by owning the license themselves. This license, IMO, will come through acquisitions - which is why capital will be important. Startups/businesses that already have that license will be prime targets.</p></li><li><p><strong>Contextual financial product launches</strong>: Financial products are going to be increasingly embedded within the user flow of a non-fintech app. Imagine MakeMyTrip offering to help you plan for a trip abroad and set up a savings feature to save INR 10,000 a month for that trip. Or even an amazon motor insurance purchase along with that bike helmet purchase. This trend will be enabled thanks to the folks like M2P, building fintech infrastructure.</p></li><li><p><strong>Innovation in wealth</strong>: Provided the current bull run sustains in 2022, we will continue to see a lot of product innovation in the wealth sector. The sector saw it's first set of innovations in 2021 with the likes of WintWealth and Grip Invest launching fixed income products. There was also educational products like Trinkrr and Marketfeed. We're likely to see more products being launched. Crypto products will fuel a large part of this innovation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Creators will become central to more business models</strong>: The covid-fueled creator economy is here to stay and 2022 might just be that breakout year. A lot of fintech business models are creator driven without us thinking of them as creator economy businesses - e.g. Smallcase and others. Either these businesses will start catering to creators as end users or will create platforms for creators to build on top of.</p></li></ol><p>Can things really get better than this? I definitely think so. This 2nd fintech wave has only just begun and is going to outlast the previous one.

NFT's were all the craze lately - did you get on that hype train? Or are you still scratching your head about all those terms? I'm mostly talking about myself here - I'm the one scratching my head. I didn't understand a lot about how this brave new world of web3 works and why it's fundamentally different from how we live our lives today. In fact, in Mar, 2021, <a href="https://fintechinside.substack.com/p/fintech-inside-24-13th-mar-2021-cryptos">I wrote that the crypto industry faces a problem</a> of too much jargon being thrown around and expecting everyone to "just get it" without doing any 101.</p><p>I've spent the last few months going deep into web3 and DeFi, trying to understand it from a first principles basis. This post is the start of an explainer series intended to improve my understanding of web3 ("learning in public") and in the process help more folks "get it" along with me. For this post, I chose to write about DAO's as DAO's encapsulate a large chunk of web3 concepts.</p><p>Buckle up!</p><p>Web3 is the latest evolution of the internet (web1: read only, web2: read, write) enabling direct ownership (web3: read, write, own). Direct ownership of assets, content, entities and more. Blockchain technology is enabling this evolution to web3 with finance/financial concepts embedded as a core tenet, by design. This aspect of web3 is like nothing we've ever seen before and is what's making us scratch our heads. It sort of reminds me of the early internet (1980's) - some people, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gipL_CEw-fk">including David Letterman</a>, just didn't "get it" and that's fine for the majority of people. Not us though, the ones building and investing in the internet and finance. We may not get it either, but we cannot look away from it or be willfully ignorant about it.</p><p><strong>The internet is witnessing its Amul moment!</strong> To understand that statement, lets first understand what is Amul.</p><p><strong>What is Amul?</strong> Amul is an Indian dairy products brand that's owned by its milk farmers. Not one entity or shareholder but 16.6mm milk farmers! It was <a href="https://amul.com/m/about-us">founded in 1946</a> as a co-operative society of milk farmers who were fed up of the unfair and manipulative trade practices of trade cartels and middlemen. The co-operative society model initially launched in a few villages and soon rolled out across Gujarat and the rest of India because of its success. This structure allowed milk farmers to take control back in their hands and own the entire supply chain ensuring they didn't lose out on income rightfully owed to them.</p><p><strong>How does Amul operate?</strong> Amul's milk farmers at the village level govern the brands operations. Milk farmers organise themselves to form Village Co-op Societies where all milk is collected and processed. Multiple Village Co-op Societies organise to form District Unions that processes the milk to various dairy products. These District Unions then organise to form State Federations who further distribute the dairy products to customer retail points. At each level in this three-tier organisation, leaders from among the milk farmers are elected to safeguard the milk farmers interests.</p><p>The Amul brand managed by Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd. (GCMMF) as the apex marketing body of these federations. Reports suggest that GCMMF keep 20% of all income and the rest is distributed downstream till the end milk farmer.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e296dd9-ba55-40b2-9eb7-34d55e4eb876_1920x1080.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e296dd9-ba55-40b2-9eb7-34d55e4eb876_1920x1080.png" width="1100" height="619" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6e296dd9-ba55-40b2-9eb7-34d55e4eb876_1920x1080.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:619,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:137181,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Amul is a true democratic organisation, owned by its 16.6mm milk farmers. &quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Amul is a true democratic organisation, owned by its 16.6mm milk farmers.

DAO's are internet-native organizations collectively owned and managed by their members. In the Indian context, think of a DAO as a Private Limited (Pvt. Ltd.) company, a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) or such other entity structures. And just like those structures have a Charter Document or in India an Articles of Association (AoA) and Memorandum of Association (MoA) that govern how a LLP/Pvt Ltd. function, a DAO has a Smart Contract that's essentially chunks of code that automatically execute whenever a set of criteria are met. Smart contracts govern the DAO and all administrative actions are executed by this smart contract. Smart contracts are initially defined by the founders of the DAO.</p><p>Saying you're excited about a DAO is like saying one's excited about a Private Limited company - it makes no sense. But as with any entity, DAO's need a purpose or product or service. That's what makes it interesting. This purpose or product or service is what brings interest from members. Members own the DAO by either buying tokens of a DAO or they're "airdropped" these tokens based on participation. Think of tokens as equity shares. Members with tokens can make new governance proposals and vote on how the DAO is governed.

The founding principles are:</p><ol><li><p><strong>No central governing entity</strong>: DAO's are intended to be completely flat entities. Founders only provide direction, but the members truly propose, vote and govern the organisation. DAO's can further be organised into departments for specific functions. e.g. <a href="https://www.bankless.community/">Bankless</a>, a community for web3 and crypto, <a href="https://www.notion.so/What-are-Guilds-and-How-do-I-Join-480beb1cdd35401d97b6d93ef6cf46ec">has Guilds</a> (departments) for marketing, writing and others. These members, guilds and the DAO has full ownership over its own roadmap and evolution.</p></li><li><p><strong>Self-regulating/democratic governance</strong>: Anyone anywhere in the world can join a DAO. This form of an entity makes it truly borderless. Moreover, anyone can make new governance proposals and watch it become part of the fabric of that DAO. DAO's then by design become self-regulating entities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Addresses the principal-agent dilemma</strong>: DAO's are autonomous entities that rely on smart contracts for governance. All actions of the DAO are executed by this smart contract and only members can propose and amend the same. This, in a big way, addresses the Principal-Agent dilemma of traditional entity structures where the authorised representative (Agent) could potentially act contrary to the best interests of a person or group (Principal). Automation via smart contracts helps address this.</p></li><li><p><strong>Community</strong>: Community is a big part of the functioning of a DAO, at least today. We've seen examples of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2021/12/01/crypto-tokens-people-constitution-dao-ether-redeem-refund/">ConstitutionDAO</a> which raised $47mm from 4,000+ members to make a bid for a copy of the US constitution. Even the folks that bought Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT's, although not a DAO, identify other buyers as part of a community. There are some 2,000+ DAO's today and you can check out their membership here on <a href="https://deepdao.io/#/deepdao/dashboard">DeepDAO </a>or <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/">Snapshot</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Transparent and radically public</strong>: Everything a DAO does is available on the public blockchain for anyone to audit or verify. Any member can check the DAO's activity before deciding to participate or purchase tokens. Traditional organizations require trust in the people behind it &#8212; especially on behalf of investors &#8212; with DAOs, only the code needs to be trusted. Trusting that code is easier to do as it&#8217;s publicly available and can be extensively tested before launch.</p></li></ol><p><strong>How would an Amul DAO work?</strong> Amul DAO is essentially bringing Amul's operations to the internet-age. Milk farmers own $AMUL governance tokens to define the roadmap of the brand and govern the administrative aspects of the brand. Owners of $AMUL tokens can participate in income sharing which will be defined by the smart contract. The Amul DAO smart contract will have rules for revenue sharing, price increases/decreases, fund raises (new token distributions), new members, new product introductions, input purchases, vendor selection and many more.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18de13dd-c574-470b-9026-ffba7d29a243_1920x1080.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18de13dd-c574-470b-9026-ffba7d29a243_1920x1080.png" width="1100" height="619" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/18de13dd-c574-470b-9026-ffba7d29a243_1920x1080.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:619,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:409282,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;What an Amul DAO would look like&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="What an Amul DAO would look like" title="What an Amul DAO would look like" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18de13dd-c574-470b-9026-ffba7d29a243_1920x1080.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18de13dd-c574-470b-9026-ffba7d29a243_1920x1080.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18de13dd-c574-470b-9026-ffba7d29a243_1920x1080.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18de13dd-c574-470b-9026-ffba7d29a243_1920x1080.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">What an Amul DAO would look like</figcaption></figure></div><p>At some point, Amul stores could accept payments via a prepaid wallet with $AMUL tokens. Specialised tokens, $cAMUL ($AMUL customer tokens) could be issued to loyal customers to participate in unique ways e.g. define the launch of a new flavour for a flavoured milk. Those tokens could be made tradable too. There's a lot that can be done from a tokenomics perspective with a brand like Amul.</p><p>Amul DAO could even raise money by minting NFT's for each of it's "Topical ads". Customers could purchase some of these very valuable works of art that have become a part of the fabric of Amul and India. I'd definitely buy those NFT's! NFT, Non-Fungible Token, is a digit asset that a) represents ownership, b) is unique and only one of it exists and c) cannot be traded (like currency) but can be bought and sold.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52ee0bcc-a924-4d6a-ad99-1cd773431da2_1920x1080.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52ee0bcc-a924-4d6a-ad99-1cd773431da2_1920x1080.png" width="1100" height="619" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/52ee0bcc-a924-4d6a-ad99-1cd773431da2_1920x1080.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:619,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3076477,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Amul doesn't actually have NFT's, but how cool would it be if they did?&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Amul doesn't actually have NFT's, but how cool would it be if they did?" title="Amul doesn't actually have NFT's, but how cool would it be if they did?" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52ee0bcc-a924-4d6a-ad99-1cd773431da2_1920x1080.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52ee0bcc-a924-4d6a-ad99-1cd773431da2_1920x1080.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52ee0bcc-a924-4d6a-ad99-1cd773431da2_1920x1080.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52ee0bcc-a924-4d6a-ad99-1cd773431da2_1920x1080.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Amul doesn't actually have NFT's, but how cool would it be if they did?</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>What are the downsides?</strong> DAO's are still a very early concept. The entire crypto community is constantly iterating to achieve their version of an optimum DAO. But there are obvious downsides that need to be addressed in the process.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Doesn't work for offline settings</strong>: DAO's are internet-native organisations. For smart contracts to function autonomously, there needs to be end-to-end data capture and tracking. In the Amul DAO example, the smart contract will need to know how much milk was deposited by each member farmer to ensure accurate income sharing. The smart contract will also need to get access to data on product quality.</p></li><li><p><strong>Communication and Collaboration breakdown</strong>: Members or token holders can vote on how the DAO functions. But us humans are still figuring out how to communicate and collaborate better. DAO's probably work in a small setting, but how things break as DAO's scale, is unclear. Near Puducherry, India, <a href="https://auroville.org/">Auroville</a>, an experimental, international, democratic community free of government, money and religion, with its own <a href="https://legislative.gov.in/sites/default/files/A1988-54.pdf">treaty with the Government of India</a>, sometimes takes years to decide whether they want to build a road within their land or if they should allow a petrol pump to set up shop.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dispute resolution</strong>: Tech is designed by humans but a DAO is governed by its smart contract. What happens if things go wrong? Who do you file a complaint against? Who do you arrest? the smart contract? It's still unclear. There is no regulation governing DAO's, so how do you resolve disputes? Again, in Amul DAO, if a customer gets spoiled milk, who should they complain to? Courts don't recognise DAO's or its smart contracts - will they hold up in a court of law? Will the founders then put the blame on the community or the smart contract? Aragon, a DAO infrastructure company, has its own dispute resolution framework - <a href="https://aragon.org/aragon-court">Aragon Court</a> and its in very early stages.</p></li><li><p><strong>Some people still need managers</strong>: As a species we're still learning how to organise ourselves. Everyone wants to be part of a community to get a sense of belonging. And as part of that organisation, there will always be leaders and followers. We've seen during covid and work from home set ups, not everyone could cope with working from home and in independence. Most people just need people to tell them what to do and follow up with them. DAO's today largely have people that are self-driven. What about those who aren't self-driven?</p></li><li><p><strong>Security Challenges</strong>: DAO's live in code and where there's code there's a hacker. Blockchain technology by itself might be impenetrable but there are other aspects that can be hacked. TheDAO, the first ever DAO launched in Apr, 2016, was hacked - days after a vulnerability was reported in the DAO's smart contract and the vulnerability was scheduled to be fixed. The hacker made away with $60mm in ETH. <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4awxep/hackers-steal-dollar140-million-from-users-of-crypto-gaming-company">These systems</a> will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814849/badgerdao-defi-120-million-hack-bitcoin-ethereum">always be a target</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Code breaks in unexpected ways</strong>: DAO's are reliant on smart contracts to be autonomous. But the reality is that code breaks in unexpected ways. There's always a risk of "unknown unknowns". Yes, blockchain is public and <a href="https://future.a16z.com/how-composability-unlocks-crypto-and-everything-else/">composability is a big feature</a> which will help to improve on past work but that doesn't solve for code behaving in unexpected ways for different use cases. We've seen how <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/sep/21/twitter-apologises-for-racist-image-cropping-algorithm">Twitter's image-cropping algorithm</a> became problematic when it cropped out non-white people from images.</p></li></ol><p><strong>What will the future of DAO's look like?</strong> It's tough to say. I do believe that DAO's will co-exist with LLP's or Pvt. Ltd. companies. DAO's will be used to address specific situations or types of missions. Problems will exist, it's not like LLP's are perfect entity structures, and we'll need more dreamers to iterate and improve on what we know as DAO's today. Even for a DAO, I think it will need a hybrid governance structure of Code + Humans - i.e. maybe the administrative work by the smart contract and others through humans. The biggest issue that DAO's will need to address is dispute resolution. Dispute resolution is an incredibly complex issue that has no straight answer, there's limited precedent as well and law always looks for precedent.</p><p>DAO's present a big opportunity, the opportunity itself is still an unknown unknown. We're <a href="https://blog.aragon.org/15-ways-the-world-is-being-transformed-by-daos/">only starting to see some direction of the different use cases</a> DAO's are being use for and we'll continue to see more evolution. Many years ago, Marc Andreessen, famous VC, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">said that</a> "Software is eating the world". Ten years later, software has taken a big first bite, but the pie is still very large. If anything, software is eating the world.... but slowly. Similarly, I don't think DAO's and web3 will change our lives dramatically in the short term, but when it does, and it will, the impact will be much larger than anything we've seen so far.</p><p>Additional Reading:</p><ol><li><p><a href="https://www.thetokendispatch.com/a-definitive-guide-to-daos/">A definitive guide to DAOs</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://future.a16z.com/dao-canon/">DAO's, A Canon</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://aragon.org/dao">Level Up Your Knowledge of DAOs</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-for-beginners/what-is-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-and-how-does-a-dao-work">What is a decentralized autonomous organization, and how does a DAO work?</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary">CoinMarketCap's Alexandria</a> (Investopedia for crypto)</p></li></ol><p><em>What did you think of today's edition?

specific financial product, dramatically improving the customer experience compared to a bank. It was always about how banks are inefficient, opaque and slow.</p><p>These fintech startups actually delivered on that promise of vertical focused product with better experience. We've seen the likes of Paytm, Citrus, PayU, mSwipe in payments, ZestMoney, CaptialFloat in consumer lending, LendingKart, NeoGrowth in SMB lending, Fisdom, Wealthy, ScripBox in wealth product distribution, Policybazaar, CoverFox in insurance and many more such startups. These startups moved the needle for financial services in India and their innovations are now base expectations from a fintech product.</p><p>Users soon started feeling the pain of having multiple accounts just to manage their money. There was also a ton of competition among startups - all targeting the same user. Banks wanted to deal with few fintechs for each vertical thereby limiting the overall partnerships that could be established.</p><p>"<strong>You either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain.</strong>"</p><p>Startups that made it past the unbundling days are now the ones leading the Grand Rebundling in Fintech. We're seeing Paytm, PhonePe, BharatPe and more re-bundling financial services to become the financial center for their large user bases. These startups want to give their users a reason to keep coming back. What better reason than being the only app for all one's financial needs. This is where these fintech startups start looking very much like the banks they set out to disrupt.</p><p>Larger fintech startups have now worn Thanos' gauntlet and are in search of their various infinity stones (fintech products). Soon, with one snap of their fingers (integrations and licenses), they'll decimate smaller fintech startups. I joke.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ce602bf-0fa4-49b7-9a47-7bec4df14d78_1024x561.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ce602bf-0fa4-49b7-9a47-7bec4df14d78_1024x561.png" width="1024" height="561" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3ce602bf-0fa4-49b7-9a47-7bec4df14d78_1024x561.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:561,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Large fintech startups resembling the banks they set out to disrupt.&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Large fintech startups resembling the banks they set out to disrupt." title="Large fintech startups resembling the banks they set out to disrupt." srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ce602bf-0fa4-49b7-9a47-7bec4df14d78_1024x561.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ce602bf-0fa4-49b7-9a47-7bec4df14d78_1024x561.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ce602bf-0fa4-49b7-9a47-7bec4df14d78_1024x561.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ce602bf-0fa4-49b7-9a47-7bec4df14d78_1024x561.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Large fintech startups resembling the banks they set out to disrupt.</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>What's driving this rebundling</strong>? The short answer - Income sources. Given the very low Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) in India, fintech startups are finding it tough to meaningfully scale revenues and profitability. Indian regulators have slowly and steadily capped margins a platform can earn through commissions. To make things worse, there are several entities waiting for their piece of the commissions pie, reducing commissions to a few basis points per entity. Broadly, payments commissions are between zero to 1%, lending commissions are 2-3%, insurance varies between 5-20%, wealth is all trail income and so on. The more use cases the platform offers a customer, higher the potential ARPU.</p><p><strong>How does this impact fintech in India?</strong> Fintech startups with large user bases will continue to consolidate fintech products. They will also become full stack providers by owning the various licenses to operate, thereby reducing their dependency on banks. Early stage fintech startups will partner with these large fintech startups as opposed to banks. This shift might crumble banks' value proposition - leaving them with <a href="https://fintechinside.substack.com/p/thirtysix">no differentiator i.e. Trust, License, Distribution</a>, compared to larger fintech startups. I wonder how fintech infrastructure startups will play a role in this rebundling.</p><p>Globally, everyone's still grappling with decentralised finance and blockchain technology. We're unsure of that's technology's potential, but it needs just one application to open the flood gates for everyone to "get it". If and when that happens, "incumbent fintech startups" will be disrupted by another wave of unbundling.</p><p>In about 2-4 years, we'll hear early-stage startups saying they want to disrupt "incumbent fintech businesses". Imagine hearing a startup disrupting Paytm or PhonePe. It's a real possibility that's already starting to take root. Experimentation is a risk at these large companies where new product introductions has to add value to a decent chunk of their user base. They'll end up behaving like banks - partnering with early stage fintech startups to reduce their own cost of customer acquisition.</p><p>If you're a fintech founder, be prepared to be asked more frequently by VC investors - "What if Paytm launches this product?" or "How will you compete with BharatPe?".</p><p><em>What did you think of today's edition?

Earlier in Aug, 2021 <strong>CRED </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/indian-fintech-cred-launches-peer-to-peer-lending-feature-mint/?tpcc=ECTW2020">launched </a>CRED Mint and <strong>BharatPe </strong>launched 12% Club, both are P2P investing and borrowing product.</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>: P2P lending is sexy again. There were a bunch of P2P lending startups that launched in 2015 but very few were able to raise funds largely because of lack of regulations. Then, in 2017, RBI introduced prudent regulations for the sector and still the sector wasn't able to attract VC attention. Startups that managed to pull through the past four years are now seeing significant traction.</p><p>LenDenClub, BharatPe's P2P platform provider for 12% Club, raising $10mm is big. LenDenClub claims to have 2.5mm borrowers and 1mm investors, facilitating loan disbursals of more than $160mm in six months of Apr to Sept-21. It's 3.95% NPA is reportedly among the lowest in the industry.</p><p>In <a href="https://fintechinside.substack.com/p/fintech-inside-34-22nd-aug-2021-agents">Aug, 2021 Edition of Fintech Inside</a>, I mentioned that this growth in P2P lending seems to be coming largely from investor interest where they're being guaranteed 9-12% returns. This investor interest in coming in a year of record liquidity and returns across virtually every asset. Both, Liquiloans and LenDenClub, platform providers to CRED and BharatPe, are getting investor interest. Liquiloans is reportedly <a href="https://twitter.com/artijourno/status/1468235248542658561?s=20">raising funds at a valuation of $200mm.</a> It'll be interesting to see how this plays out.</p><p><strong>2&#65039;&#8419; Indian regulators were busy this week</strong></p><p><strong>RBI (central bank)</strong>: <a href="https://www.livemint.com/industry/banking/rbi-to-launch-a-upi-based-payment-product-for-feature-phone-users-11638942502592.html">Will launch</a> a UPI-like product for feature phones. <a href="https://www.livemint.com/industry/banking/rbi-to-launch-a-upi-based-payment-product-for-feature-phone-users-11638942502592.html">Will enable</a> small value transactions through an &#8220;On-device" wallet in UPI app to conserve banks&#8217; system resources without any impact to users. <a href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/finance/rbi-proposes-discussion-paper-on-digital-payment-charges-fintech-cos-paytm-may-see-impact-11745922.htm">Plans to float</a> a discussion paper on digital payment charges "<em>to ensure they are both affordable to users, and economically remunerative to providers</em>". <a href="https://twitter.com/PratikBhakta_89/status/1468454935134031872">Increased the limit</a> for UPI IPO subscriptions from $2,666 (INR 200K) to $6,666 (INR 500K).</p><p><strong>SEBI (securities regulator)</strong>: <a href="https://www.sebi.gov.in/reports-and-statistics/reports/dec-2021/consultation-paper-on-algorithmic-trading-by-retail-investors_54515.html">Released</a> a consultation paper seeking comments on regulating trading algorithms by retail investors.</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>: RBI, IMO, has always been pro active and encouraged innovation but only if that innovation aligns with its goal of financial inclusion. This financial inclusion is obviously not its stated objective but revealed objective. RBI's fintech regulatory sandbox was geared toward inclusion, it's various Discussion Papers discusses inclusion at length. Now this announcement of UPI-like product on feature phones, especially since <a href="https://www.npci.org.in/what-we-do/99/product-overview">NPCI's USSD product never took off</a>. If you're writing to RBI for whatever proposal, definitely include inclusion. :)</p><p>The announcement of "on-device wallet" for payments is an incredibly unique solution for the constrained system resources problem but maybe not the best suited solution. UPI data shows that of the 140mm UPI transactions per day (in Oct, 2021), 50% transactions were less than $2.7 (INR 200) in value. That's a lot of system hits for such low value transactions that'll only get worse as UPI grows in popularity. This is a problem that's dying for a <a href="https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-polygon-matic-and-why-it-matters-for-ethereum">Polygon, off-chain computing and scaling </a>solution. Crypto folks, are you reading this?</p><p>SEBI, on the other hand, seems to be bringing spools of red tape to the digital age with this consultation paper. In its consultation paper, SEBI wants to bring regulations for retail algorithmic trading. Some recommendations made are that every algorithmic strategy will have to be approved by the regulator and each strategy will have to have a unique ID so as to identify who algorithm is firing the order. There are many more but a lot of onus will be on the stock broker and they'll have to equip their systems to manage this.</p><p>Some brokers <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/stock-markets/sebi-mulls-norms-to-regulate-algo-trading-by-retail-investors/article37917505.ece">claim that 50% of trades</a> are algorithmic, Zerodha claims algorithmic trades are only 0.5% of total trades. I don't have a very informed view on this consultation paper, so here's <a href="https://community.dhan.co/t/view-on-sebi-s-consultation-paper-on-algorithmic-trading-by-retail-investors/401">Pravin Jadhav's (Founder, Raise Holding) view</a> and here's a <a href="https://zerodha.com/z-connect/queries/general-queries/the-rise-of-algo-trading-platforms-everything-you-need-to-know">short view</a> by Nithin Kamath (Founder, Zerodha). If you have a view on this, I urge you to write to SEBI that's inviting comments via email (sushmau@sebi.gov.in) latest by January 15, 2022.</p><p>3&#65039;&#8419;<strong> SEA Fintech Round up</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Japan&#8217;s Financial Services Agency</strong> (FSA) <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2021/japan-to-propose-limiting-stablecoin-issuance/">will propose</a> legislation in 2022 to make it so only banks and wire transfer companies can issue stablecoins.</p></li><li><p><strong>Revolut</strong>'s Capital Market Services (CMS) license <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/fintech-unicorn-revolut-cms-license-mas">was approved</a> by Singapore's central bank (MAS).</p></li><li><p><strong>Kredivo</strong>, an Indonesian BNPL startup, <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/payment-methods/2021/bnpl-platform-kredivo-unveils-new-payment-card/">launched</a> a payment card product.</p></li><li><p><strong>Brankas</strong>, a South East Asian fintech infrastructure startup, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brankas-embarks-poc-develop-open-000000901.html">was awarded</a> a Proof of Concept grant by MAS for experimentation, development, and dissemination of nascent innovative technologies in the financial services sector.</p></li><li><p><strong>WeLab</strong>, a Hong Kong based digital banking startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/hong-kong-welab-indonesian-digital-bank/">raised </a>$240mm and <a href="https://e27.co/welab-acquires-bank-jasa-jakarta-to-launch-digital-bank-in-indonesia-20211207/">acquired</a> <strong>Bank Jasa Jakarta</strong> (BJJ), a 50-year old, Indonesian commercial bank.</p></li><li><p>Seven <strong>SEA Fintech</strong> startups <a href="https://twifasia.substack.com/p/this-week-in-fintech-asia-11th-dec">raised a total of $524mm</a> and three raised an undisclosed amount.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>: Tether, a USD-denominated stable coin, was in the middle of a storm when US regulators launched an enquiry into the coin's reserves. It was later disclosed that Tether is not 1:1 backed by the US Dollar, in fact <a href="https://beincrypto.com/tether-mints-three-billion-usdt-past-two-weeks/">less than 3%</a> of Tether's circulating USDT supply of $76bn is backed by US Dollar reserves. In the wake of this, Japan's approach of regulating stablecoins to be issued only by banks or wire transfer companies seems warranted.</p><p>With its CMS license, Revolut expects to launch stock trading by first half of 2022. Kredivo, an Indonesian BNPL startup, launched a payment card - basically coming full circle back to credit cards. The Brankas PoC grant is most fascinating - it will work directly with MAS to launch an open source core banking system (CBS). Innovating a core banking system in 2021 hopefully bring our banks to 2021 as well. The big question though is what approach this project will take - retrofit existing CBS of banks or build a new one from the ground up. Each approach will have its own challenges. Excited to see how this project takes shape.</p><p>SEA Fintech startups have been on a tear lately with regard to funding. The pace of funding (at least the one's that announced) in Indian fintech startups seems to have slowed post Diwali, but not in SEA. Digital banking startups raised $310mm of the $524mm this week. Welab from Hong Kong used its fund raise to acquire a 50-year old Indonesian bank.

In one word - regulations. You might be wondering, "<em>Osborne, everyone knows that, but what regulation do they want?</em>". That was my question as well and there's no straight answer to that, unfortunately. None of our Indian crypto startups have anything public (that I could find) on what sort of regulations they want. There's no public information on what have been their submissions or recommendations to the government. As per a MoneyControl interview of Mr. Jayant Sinha, Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Finance, it seems even the government is <a href="https://youtu.be/PX1rVoV3udg?t=3439">waiting to hear back from crypto founders</a> as to what are their recommendations.</p><p>This is not to say that founders in crypto are not doing anything to engage with the government on this front. In fact, crypto companies have formed an industry body - <a href="https://www.bacc.co.in/">Blockchain and Crypto Assets Council (BACC)</a> as a part of <a href="https://www.iamai.in/">IAMAI</a>, to liaise with the government. There reportedly was a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/cryptocurrency/news/leading-crypto-players-in-india-likely-to-meet-with-indian-government-next-week-to-give-inputs/articleshow/87642591.cms">government consultation</a> with founders and stakeholders of various exchanges in mid-Nov, 2021. Here's an <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/parliamentary-panel-meeting-cryptocurrencies-bitcoin-rbi-1877974-2021-11-18">interesting coverage</a> of the presentation made by BACC covering the "Challenges and Opportunities". I'm assuming/hoping the Crypto Bill we're expecting, will include recommendations from those consultations.</p><p>Unlike crypto bros who say "<em>everything is transparently available on the blockchain, best technology ever!</em>", crypto founders seem to be covert about what they want as regulations. Maybe there's a strategy that I don't see here - please write to me as I really want to understand. In March, 2021, I <a href="https://fintechinside.substack.com/p/fintech-inside-24-13th-mar-2021-cryptos">wrote about the crypto industry's problem with making crypto accessible</a> and the problem seems to be playing out in spades right now.</p><p>The closest we come to understanding what the crypto industry wants from regulators is in a document made public in March, 2021 by BACC titled <strong><a href="https://0b3faf4e-a8a8-46c5-8241-4f2153134ee5.filesusr.com/ugd/1fc159_d6eb6ef4e7eb4793a9b8f5464dfe60a1.pdf">The Case for Regulating the Use of Cryptocurrency in India</a></strong>. The document makes a compelling case for regulations but stops short of talking about what regulations it proposes. <a href="https://www.ijlt.in/_files/ugd/066049_35b621836d1744af9c168b065c267974.pdf">Same with this document</a> by Nishith Desai and Associates, an Indian law firm, that goes deep into the legal aspects of the need to regulate crypto-assets.</p><p>The one document I could find, that studied the global regulatory landscape, contextualised it for India and made recommendations on what regulations should be made for India, is <strong><a href="https://www.orfonline.org/research/regulating-crypto-assets-in-india/">Regulating Crypto Assets in India</a></strong> by Observer Research Foundation (ORF). In its proposal, ORF says "<em>Like all financial assets, crypto assets pose certain policy risks that must be addressed through a coherent framework that balances the public interest with the need to encourage innovation.</em>"</p><p>ORF's report proposes the following regulations (abridged version below):</p><ol><li><p>Defining a crypto-asset as "... <em>asset that is created and conveyed using any distributed ledger technology and is not legal tender</em>..."</p></li><li><p>Adopting a co-regulatory approach where SEBI, RBI, Ministry of Finance and crypto founders, collaborate to regulate the sector.</p></li><li><p>Making crypto asset custody services and exchange interoperable.</p></li><li><p>Introducing investor protection norms that are similar to SEBI&#8217;s disclosure-based frameworks.</p></li><li><p>Notifing crypto asset service providers as &#8220;Reporting Entities&#8221; under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002.</p></li><li><p>Introducing a safe harbour such as the one provided under Section 79 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 for all crypto asset service providers</p></li><li><p>Taxing income from crypto assets as capital gains.</p></li><li><p>Regulating crypto asset ads through a framework similar to money market mutual funds</p></li><li><p>Having exchanges and other crypto asset service providers comply with reporting requirement under foreign exchange regulations</p></li><li><p>Establish minimum security standards</p></li><li><p>Introducing tax incentives for entities that give relevant and verified information on any other crypto asset service provider acting in contravention of the law.</p></li><li><p>Prohibiting the listing of crypto assets that have no public address</p></li></ol><p>Now, I don't agree with all the recommendations made here, but it gives a starting point. At least someone did their homework. I urge you to <a href="https://www.orfonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ORF_Monograph_Crypto-Assets_Final-30Nov.pdf">read the full report</a> as it provides a detailed study on the technology, need to regulate and compares global regulations in depth. If you want another perspective on recommendations to regulate crypto in India, <a href="https://www.indiatech.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IndiaTech.org_Crypto_Policy_Proposal_2021.pdf">here's IndiaTech.org's report</a>. It's not as detailed makes some good proposals.</p><p>Mr. Jayant Sinha in the interview mentioned above, aside from showing some serious knowledge about the crypto landscape, claims that there are 15mm crypto accounts holding $6bn in crypto. So there's a lot riding on this bill that's expected to be passed. Mr. Mukesh Ambani also issued an all encompassing statement in support of blockchain tech.</p><p>One faction of this industry is against regulation saying it will hinder innovation, especially on the broader web3 front. While another faction wants regulation saying it will build consumer trust. NDTV, a news media company, <a href="https://twitter.com/ndtv/status/1466393616130220034?s=20">claimed to have details</a> of the draft bill where it says that the government will not ban but regulate crypto as assets and will appoint SEBI (securities regulator) to regulate the industry. It's still left to be seen what the actual bill will look like.</p><p>While we think about regulating crypto over the next couple of weeks, it might be worth remembering that the internet is 30-40 years old and governments are still struggling to regulate it. India is still to pass its data privacy bill! The coming couple of weeks will really set the tone for the future of crypto in India - wagmi.</p><p><em>What did you think of today's post?

RuPay accounts for 63% of all debit cards issued in India. VISA's dominance in the global card network sector has been threatened for years now as more countries launch their own networks - China has UnionPay, Russia has Mir, Europe is building <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/07/10/europe-digital-payments-network-epi-sepa-mastercard-visa/">European Payments Initiative</a>. Here's a <a href="https://finshots.in/archive/why-does-visa-dislike-rupay/">good podcast by Finshots</a> if you want deeper information.</p><p>The Star Health Insurance IPO flop was surprising to me. The business is one of the better standalone health insurers in India. Analysts claim it's valuation was too high and that almost 60% of the IPO proceeds were an offer for sale which made investors wary. CoinDCX said it will launch an IPO if regulations permits as a way to gain investor trust in crypto as an asset class. That's a bold move and will be interesting to see how it plays out.</p><p><strong>Slice</strong>, a Gen Z credit card startup, turned unicorn this week. The startup has been growing significantly and is now the third largest credit card issuer in the country. WhatsApp's payment offering on UPI has been growing slowly (~20+mm users) because of restrictions from the payments body NPCI. It's slowly launching its SMB offering as well and earlier this week launched cab hailing services within the app. WhatsApp's WeChat transformation is slow but deliberate.</p><p><strong>2&#65039;&#8419; Fintech startups acquiring other fintech startups</strong></p><p><strong>CRED </strong><a href="https://entrackr.com/2021/12/exclusive-cred-to-acquire-expense-management-firm-happay/">acquired </a><strong>Happay</strong>, an expense management startup, for $180mm in cash and stock. <strong>Indiamart </strong><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/indiamart-intermesh-acquires-stake-in-m1xchange-for-rs-32-crore/articleshow/87987621.cms">acquired</a> a 7.7% stake in <strong>M1Exchange</strong>, a trade receivables financing startup. <strong>Cashfree </strong><a href="https://www.businesstoday.in/industry/banks/story/sbi-backed-cashfree-acquires-majority-stake-in-uae-based-payments-firm-telr-313864-2021-11-30">acquired </a>a majority stake in <strong>Telr</strong>, a UAE based payments firm.</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>: Amazing to see so many exits for the startup ecosystem in the same year - first with IPO's and now thorugh acquisitions. Even 5 years back exits were just something you'd see as Exit clauses in shareholding agreements. More of this.</p><p>CRED's acquisition of Happay is counter-intuitive but makes so much sense though. Happay has access to a ~1mm employees with annual spends of $1bn. But more importantly, Happay's entire payments stack built to manage corporate payments is potentially valuable to CRED. Cashfree's acquisition of Telr seems to be an acquisition of market access. M2P Fintech is growing fast the Middle East and now Cashfree will enter the market with some existing presence.</p><div><hr></div><blockquote><p><strong>Looking for the news digest? </strong>Read all the week&#8217;s fintech news and updates in India and SEA over at <a href="http://asia.thisweekinfintech.com">This Week in Fintech - India and SEA Edition</a>.

I was amazed at the numbers when I compared various public Indian financial companies. Today's post details out that finding and hope to lower expectations of most people from fintech startups.</p><p>There was also the Niti Aayog discussion paper on digital banking regulation. Unknown to most of us in India, Ajaib (Zerodha of Indonesia) acquired a 24% stake in a local bank, but Ajaib isn't the one to acquire a stake in a bank. There's details on that.

Incredible, right?</p><p>Note: for this exercise, I've stuck to public financial companies and companies that have a some concentration to one business vertical.

They have the distribution capability of their umbrella entity built in. In fact, you'll find very few financial companies (even outside these 12 companies) that make it large without the brand of a big bank. Fintech startups don't have this distribution luxury and are often shut out of partnerships with these financial firms.</p></li><li><p>These financial companies are operating traditional financial products with limited innovation. Fintech startups are innovating product, distribution, underwriting capabilities, pricing strategies and many more. There's no way to draw direct, apples-to-apples, comparisons with fintech startups and traditional businesses.</p></li></ol><p>All this brings me to my "<strong>One Big Thought</strong>": <strong>Fintech startups don't need tens of millions of customers. </strong>Fintech startups could build very successful, profitable businesses with a couple million customers at max. It's a huge disservice to think/expect fintech startups to have hundreds or even tens of millions of customers just because they're building in/for India. These startups probably just need to go deep (not wide) and continue to offer value to these customers.</p><p><em>What do you think about this analysis - have a different point of view?

"<em>This Discussion paper makes a case, and offers a template and roadmap for a digital bank licensing and regulatory framework in India</em>". The paper talks about under-penetration of financial services in the country and how digital banking can address some of those issues.</p><p>It also suggests that digital banks cannot be offered a regulatory arbitrage and should be regulated, from a prudential norms and liquidity perspective, as universal banks but without the requirement for physical branches.</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>: This is a big step in the right direction. While Niti Aayog is just a think tank, it does a lot of the "thinking" for the government. Even though Niti Aayog is addressing digital banking in the context of financial inclusion, it's important as this is a signal the RBI and the powers that be are definitely thinking of a digital banking regime. So far it's just been rumours. We're still 2-3 years (IMO) away from actual digital banking regulations though.</p><p>The discussion paper however seems to focus a lot on the SMB sector. In fact the discussion paper is proposing this digital banking regime to address a massive credit gap to the sector. The report claims that there are 64mm unincorporated SMB's in India, of which 99% are micro businesses and they create 110mm jobs. A large fraction of this sector continues to operate outside the ambit of formal finance.</p><p>The discussion paper goes on to propose a 2-stage approach to roll out the regulation: Stage 1 - Digital Banking Sandbox, Stage 2 - Establishing the regulation and issuing Digital Universal Bank Licenses. First, applicants will operate under the sandbox regime, with metrics (CAC, credit disbursal and performance, operations and more) closely measured so that the RBI can learn and improve its regulation. Based on the RBI's learnings from the sandbox, it will establish the final Digital Universal Banking regulation. The paper, loosely recommends the same regulatory requirements as a Small Finance Bank.</p><p>As a subscriber of this newsletter, you'd know I've <a href="https://fintechinside.substack.com/p/thirtysix">addressed</a> <a href="https://fintechinside.substack.com/p/fintech-inside-29-18th-jul-2021-neo">digital banking</a> <a href="https://fintechinside.substack.com/p/fintech-inside-29-18th-jul-2021-neo">regulations</a> <a href="https://fintechinside.substack.com/p/thirtyfive">several times</a> <a href="https://fintechinside.substack.com/p/fintech-inside-13-5th-dec-2020">over the past year</a>.

It seems Niti Aayog was reading the newsletter as well (I joke!).</p><p><strong>2&#65039;&#8419; Indonesian startups continue to acquire minority stakes in local banks</strong></p><p><strong>Ajaib</strong>, an Indonesian stock investment startup, <a href="https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/ajaib-buys-bank-bumi-arta-270708/">acquired 24% shareholding</a> in Bank Bumi Arta, a local Indonesian bank, for $52mm.</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>: Firstly, about Ajaib: founded in 2019, Ajaib is among the largest stock brokerages in Indonesia, accounting for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ardianwibisono/2021/10/04/online-stock-brokerage-ajaib-becomes-indonesias--fastest-unicorn/">1mm of the 2.7mm stock accounts</a>. Think of Ajaib as the Zerodha of Indonesia. &lt;1% of the total population participates in the stock markets. It's raised a total of ~$180mm and was Indonesia's fastest unicorn at its last funding round in Oct, 2021. The most fascinating part: the founder is<a href="https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30/2020/asia/finance-vc/#46d48cd56c71"> 26 years old and co-founder 28</a>!</p><p>Ajaib is not the first startup to acquire stake in an Indonesian bank. <strong>GoTo</strong>, Gojek and Tokopedia merged entity, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/gojek-backed-bank-jago-aims-leverage-tech-giants-data-2021-07-06/">acquired</a> <strong>Bank Jago</strong>. <strong>Kredivo</strong> <a href="https://www.idnfinancials.com/news/39194/kredivo-owner-acquires-bank-bisnis-internasional">acquired 24% stake</a> in <strong>Bank Bisnis Internasional</strong>. <strong>SEA Group's ecommerce arm Shopee</strong> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/sea-bke/update-1-indonesian-banking-regulator-says-sea-groups-shopee-acquires-bank-bke-idUSL1N2KO0DZ">acquired</a> <strong>Bank BKE</strong>. Maybe I'm missing a few more. I don't think this will be the end - there will be more startups acquiring stakes in Indonesian Banks.</p><p>In fact, you'd remember <a href="https://fintechinside.substack.com/p/thirtyfive">I mentioned in Edition #35,</a> that OJK, Indonesia's central bank, seems to prefer acquisitions as opposed to new licenses. "<em>It's [minimum capital requirements] a huge barrier to entry for any new digital banking startup. But it seems the Indonesian regulator, OJK, here doesn't want new entities to launch from the ground up. It seems to want consolidation and conversion to digital banking possibly via acquisition by tech companies, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/indonesia-banks/indonesia-revamps-banking-rules-to-spur-digital-transformations-idUSL4N2PR16W">as per its statement</a>.</em>"</p><p><strong>3&#65039;&#8419; UPI is free but not to SBI Bank</strong></p><p><strong>SBI Bank</strong> is <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-yet-to-refund-rs-164cr-charged-as-upi-fees-before-2020-to-jan-dhan-a/cs/articleshow/87837278.cms">yet to refund $22.2mm charged</a> to Jan Dhan accounts as UPI processing fees. The Bank collected $~34mm in fees for UPI transactions made between April 2017 and December 2019. SBI made part payment of $12mm so far.</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>: IIT Bombay released a report some years back regarding these charges levied by SBI Bank on UPI transactions made by Basic Savings Bank Deposit Account (Jan Dhan) account holders. SBI Bank charged between INR 6-19 per UPI transaction beyond four a month! It's been two years since this report came to light and SBI is yet to refund this amount. Those account holders, typically rural people, probably don't even know they are due this amount from their bank.</p><p>I usually refrain from making extreme statements, but this is basically day time robbery. UPI is free - no charges are to be levied on the user and still the largest public bank in India charged those account holders exorbitant fees. SBI Bank is, of course, not the only bank guilty of levying charges at their will. In fact, had it not been for the IIT Bombay report, this robbery wouldn't have come to light.</p><p>Of all the dark patterns that our banks employ in their processes, the one the really gets me is that banks don't notify customers when a financial fee has been charged to their account. Annual fees, account fees, notification fees, GST etc - no SMS, no whatsapp text, no notification. Even though banks charge users for SMS notifications as well. <em>/end rant</em></p><div><hr></div><blockquote><p><strong>Looking for the news digest? </strong>Read all the week&#8217;s fintech news and updates in India and SEA over at <a href="http://asia.thisweekinfintech.com">This Week in Fintech - India and SEA Edition</a>.

She's passionate about impact and gender lens initiatives</em>. <em>All views are personal.</em></p><p>One afternoon, while reading an article about women in leadership roles in the investment sector, I was struck by a peculiar thought &#8211; &#8220;<em>Why is it that women are not trusted to make sound decisions at leadership positions (e.g., fund managers, founders) but considered well-equipped to make similar decisions at their household level?</em>&#8221;. Through this post, I pen down some initial thoughts that came to my mind as I continue to unravel this space.</p><p>A majority of Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) in emerging markets target women from underserved communities &#8211; providing them with credit and even training, at times. Research strongly points to the fact that providing financial resources to women not only improves the household&#8217;s economic status but also improves other interlinked outcomes. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306919217303688#b0175">Studies find that</a> &#8220;<em>women invest as much as 10 times more of their earnings than men do in their family&#8217;s well-being, in areas including child health, education and nutrition.</em>&#8221;</p><p>Investors consider these data points when deciding to invest in high-potential NBFCs that place women at the heart of their models i.e. as a key client to achieve their mandated goal of improving financial inclusion. On the other hand, when it comes to hiring women at leadership positions in investment teams or investing in women founders, investors apply a different lens &#8211; more often than not, tending towards supporting male fund managers or founders. A 2021 <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/crenshaw-amac-remarks-070721">U.S. SEC Diversity and Inclusion report</a> found that &#8220;<em>less than 1% of the $70 trillion of global financial assets is managed by minority-or women-owned firms.</em>&#8221;</p><p>This dissonance confuses me. I struggle to understand the nuances at play here. How is it that underserved women, often with limited exposure or education (not by choice though), can be trusted to make sound financial decisions for their family but highly educated women at potential leadership positions cannot be trusted to make the right financial decisions. If we take a relative view of the issue at hand, the proportion of funds managed by women at a household level relative to their total financial resources is almost equivalent to the proportion of funds managed by women fund managers or founders as compared to their total financial resources.</p><p>Is it that women, regardless of their professional achievements, are perceived ill-equipped to make sound decisions? Recent research seems to suggest that this hesitation to support women in leadership roles, be it as fund managers or founders, is unsubstantiated by data. It has been demonstrated that supporting women leaders not only creates a strong social impact (which in itself should be enough!) but also makes sound financial and business sense for investors. A <a href="https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/topics_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/gender+at+ifc/resources/gender-balance-in-emerging-markets">2019 International Finance Corporation (IFC) study</a> found &#8220;<em>gender-diverse fund managers deliver an incremental 10% to 20% in returns compared to non-gender-diverse peers&#8221; and &#8220;only ~12% of decision makers at VC firms are women, and most firms still don&#8217;t have a single female partner.</em>&#8221;</p><p>Could underlying cultural and intergenerational conditioning and patriarchal attitudes be at play here? As evidenced by a Harvard Business Review (HBR) report found that &#8220;<em>women-led startups received just 2.3% of VC funding in 2020.</em>&#8221;</p><p>Are women not trusted at leadership positions due to a limited number of women with adequate investment experience? The 2019 IFC report found that &#8220;<em>a mere 11% of senior investment professionals in emerging markets&#8217; private equity and venture capital are women.</em>&#8221;</p><p>Is it possible that this could be attributed to, what I like to call, the &#8220;male bonding&#8221; effect i.e., having men in leadership positions typically creates a strong pull and preference towards male colleagues? The <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/women-led-startups-received-just-2-3-of-vc-funding-in-2020">HBR report found</a> that &#8220;The VC and PE industries are still largely homogenous. Men comprise 90% and 85% of investment committees in both, respectively.&#8221; This unconscious and inherent bias in hiring and promotions is a problem that runs deeper. Data from <a href="https://www.kauffmanfellows.org/journal_posts/female_founders_hire_more_women">Kauffman Fellows</a> shows that &#8220;<em>women are much more likely to be hired when making use of blind applications.</em>&#8221;</p><p>As we pick up the pieces and usher in a new era with renewed hope for a more equitable and inclusive future, now is the time for investors to elevate their thinking and open their eyes to the untapped potential of women leaders. As we have seen time and again, diversity of perspective and thought, can be a key differentiator between the losing and winning bet. IFC&#8217;s 2019 report serves as a strong proof point, it found that &#8220;<em>when VC firms increased female-partner hires by 10%, they saw 1.5% increases in returns for the overall funds and 9.7% more profitable exits.</em>&#8221;</p><p>There are proven economic benefits with women as financial decision makers. As I continue to research this space and find the answers I am looking for, I am optimistic that we will see more investors truly championing the cause for women in leadership roles. Early evidence from a <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/access/gender-diversity">Morgan Stanley 2021 study</a> echoes this trend, finding that &#8220;<em>67% of global asset owners identify gender diversity as an area of interest within their investment portfolios.</em>&#8221;</p><p>Sheryl Sandberg probably said it best, &#8220;<em>In the future, there will be no female leaders. There will just be leaders.</em>&#8221;</p><p><em>What did you think of today's edition? Know a women who could benefit from reading this piece - share it with them.</em></p><p><em>If you'd like publish a guest post, <a href="mailto:connect@osborne.vc">write to me</a> with your post and let's get your ideas to a thriving fintech community.</em></p><p><strong>1-min Anonymous Feedback:</strong> Your feedback helps me improve this newsletter.

The report explains the research done, considerations of the report and 12 recommendations for digital lending in the country. This report comes in the same week the Indian income tax department <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1772665">conducted search and seizure operations</a> at a digital lending company's offices for "<em>allegedly charging very high processing fee at the time of disbursement of loans</em>".

The RBI notes "<em>While the current share of digital lending in overall credit pie of the financial sector is not significant for it to affect financial stability, the growth momentum has compelling stability implications.</em>". The report's recommendations had three guiding principles: technology neutrality, principle backed regulation and addressing regulatory arbitrage.</p><p>The 12 recommendations are a step in the right direction, IMO, but some are vague and some tricky to implement. The report recommends to set up a nodal authority to have a verification process for digital lending apps. This authority will also maintain a black list of lending service providers. It recommends that algorithmic features should be documented (how?!). It's left to be seen how many of these recommendations get adopted.

Where there's Paytm there's controversy, unfortunately. It's commendable what Paytm has achieved over the years leading to a $14bn listing and India's largest IPO ever. Without Paytm, QR and mobile payments wouldn't be as ubiquitous as it is today. Paytm has pivoted and pivoted to becoming a super app, as I covered in my <a href="https://fintechinside.substack.com/p/fortytwo">Paytm IPO prospectus breakdown</a>.</p><p>Macquarie <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/ipos/paytm-listing-macquarie-initiates-coverage-with-underperform-target-implies-40-downside-from-ipo-price">released a report</a> on the day of Paytm's listing implying a 40% downside to listing price. The report titled 'Too Many Fingers in Too Many Pies' cited "lack of focus and direction" in the payments platform's business model. This was bound to happen as people don't seem to fundamentally understand Paytm's business model. Nobody seems to ask Reliance, HDFC or Tata why they're in such disparate businesses and how it all ties together. The most important take away from this episode: don't rely on others research or borrow conviction from others. Do your own research and build your own conviction.</p><p><strong>3&#65039;&#8419; SEA Fintech round up</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Arbo Works</strong>, a Singaporean fintech startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/sequoia-120-angel-investors-back-former-google-execs-consumer-finance-startup-arbo-works/">raised </a>an undisclosed amount.</p></li><li><p><strong>BSP</strong>, the Philippine Central Bank, <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/international/2021/philippines-central-bank-exploring-regional-payment-network/">plans to build</a> a regional instant bank transfer network.

OVO, the Indonesian payments giant, going the Paytm and PhonePe route of launching full stack financial services with the launch of its fixed income product.

The company believes its MSP pool be worth close to $1 billion by the time it goes public. The company is also looking to double its merchant base to 14 million by March 2023.</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>: I like this update. It's impressive that BharatPe is thinking about building a loyal merchant network with equity. Most businesses have always thought only of employees as "owners" of the business, where employees get access to ESOP's. But merchants/supply side are equally important.</p><p>The first I heard of any company offering equity to non-employees was Airbnb, where it made a special plan to allocate equity to its home owners at the time of IPO. I don't know what are the challenges with Indian companies setting up such structures, but would be cool to see a marketplace provide equity/ownership to its supply partners.</p><p>What this BharatPe merchant equity pool also does is expand the capital markets participation market by default. It'll be amazing to see rural merchants discovering they have stocks, getting intrigued by the markets and then further participating in it.</p><p>However, the challenge to all this is the "equity/ownership" mindset among Indians. Ask any employee today in India if they prefer a higher upfront salary or higher ESOP allocation - the answer, in chorus, will be the former. I hope this changes.</p><p><strong>2&#65039;&#8419; Singapore Fintech Festival announcements round up</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Singapore</strong> and <strong>Philippines</strong> <a href="https://fintechnews.sg/57085/singapore-fintech-festival-2021/singapore-and-the-philippines-ink-deal-for-cross-border-qr-payments-linkage/">linked </a>their instant bank transfer systems for a cross border QR payments system.</p></li><li><p><strong>Singapore</strong> <a href="https://fintechnews.sg/57068/singapore-fintech-festival-2021/singapore-rolls-out-new-e-giro-service-to-shorten-processing-time-to-minutes/">rolled out</a> e-GIRO, it's direct debits payments system, which will reduce processing time from the previous GIRO system.</p></li><li><p><strong>Singapore </strong><a href="https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/90140/singapore-launches-national-programme-for-artificial-inteliigence-in-finance?utm_medium=rssfinextra&amp;utm_source=finextrafeed">launched </a>a national program for artificial intelligence in finance.</p></li><li><p>Singapore's <strong>Infocomm Media Development Authority</strong> (IMDA) and <strong>MAS</strong> (central bank) <a href="https://fintechnews.sg/57235/blockchaintradefinance/imda-mas-and-adgm-complete-worlds-first-digital-trade-financing-pilot/">completed</a> the world&#8217;s first cross-border digital trade financing pilot.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>: Singapore is a tiny country with big ambitions. For any company that wants access to literally the entire Asian market, Singapore is the base location. Every other country in the region knows this and so does Singapore.</p><p>Despite this, Singapore is not complacent. Not even close to being complacent. Ambitious Singapore wants to be the financial capital of world's eastern hemisphere and with all its focus on web3, crypto, and traditional finance, it's "future-proofing" its position in the global financial markets.</p><p>These updates from Singapore, via the Singapore Fintech Festival, show that Singapore is progressive, innovative and collaborative. It's even putting money where its mouth is by investing capital in artificial intelligence, fraud analytics, centralised databases and many more initiatives. It's almost as if the Monetary Authority of Singapore (central bank) is functioning like a startup - move fast, break things, improve it and reiterate.

Read on:</p><p><strong>The exciting</strong>: Mastercard launching a payment card for crypto to fiat conversion on the fly is cool. It's partnered with crypto exchanges in South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand and Australia for this. And of course, there had to be news of K-Pop NFT's. At this point, if there's an artist without an NFT, are they really an artist?</p><p><strong>The impressive</strong>: DBS's digital exchange (DDEx) has been on a tear in the two months since it launched 24x7 trading - $600mm in digital assets under custody, 3x from the previous month.</p><p>If you've been reading my other newsletter, <a href="https://twifasia.substack.com">This Week in Fintech</a>, you'd probably know by now that Thailand's Banks are for some reason making big moves in crypto. <strong>Kasikornbank </strong><a href="https://fintechnews.sg/56451/blockchain/kasikornbanks-tech-arm-launches-defi-incubator-nft-marketplace/">launched</a> Kasikorn X (KX), a DeFi Incubator, and Coral, an NFT Marketplace and it invested in Pantera Capital.

This is not being reported about enough.</p><p><strong>The weird</strong>: What's the Indonesian religious council doing in web3? Well, crypto-trading is now deemed "haram". The country with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_by_country">world's largest Muslim population</a> will now not be trading in crypto. Also, ever since China banned crypto platforms, the exchanges there have been running amok to find a solution. Huobi is now restructuring to Gibraltar to continue serving customers globally.

It's IPO goes live tomorrow i.e. 1st Nov, 2021, where PB Fintech will look to raise ~$760mm of which $507mm will be fresh issue. At listing, PB Fintech will be the only listed "insurance" sector startup and the sixth company in the "insurance" sector to be listed, after ICICI Lombard, ICICI Prudential, HDFC Life Insurance, SBI Life Insurance and New India Assurance. Here's the Red Herring Prospectus (RHP) breakdown of PB Fintech - a company that's only gone from strength to strength over the years.</p><p><em>Disclaimer: This post is purely intended for educational purposes. It is not investment advice and should not be construed as such. Please consult your investment advisor for such things. Further, this post is me cherry picking sections of the Red Herring Prospectus (RHP). <a href="https://www.sebi.gov.in/filings/public-issues/oct-2021/pb-fintech-limited-rhp_53558.html">Please read the RHP for full context.</a> I am not directly or indirectly</em> <em>a shareholder of PB Fintech.</em></p><p><em>Standard definitions: $1 = INR 74 (constant prices). FY is the fiscal year ended 31st March of the respective year. YoY is Year on Year.</em></p><p>Policybazaar is among the first insurtech startups to launch in India and truly breakout to become what it is today. Insurance and wealth have typically been "push" products where the user doesn't really see the need for it (until they need it) and is therefore very hard to sell. It's also a product that sees interaction about once a year - at the time of sale or renewal. Building a startup in a sector plagued with daunting regulations, complicated product design, fraught with misselling and many more problems, could have been mistaken for a fools game.</p><p>Policybazaar started out in 2008 to simplify insurance and make pricing transparent. At that time, India's <a href="https://m.economictimes.com/news/economy/finance/indias-general-insurance-penetration-level-at-0-60-of-its-gdp-report/articleshow/4803096.cms">general insurance penetration</a> was 0.6% with $6.2bn (<em>INR 30K Cr at USD 1 = INR 48.45</em>) in annual gross written premium. Moreover,<a href="https://fintechinside.substack.com/p/thirtyseven"> in 2007</a> IRDAI finally lifted insurance pricing tariffs, effectively opening up the industry. India has come a long way since then with <a href="https://www.ibef.org/industry/insurance-sector-india.aspx">general insurance penetration</a> is at ~0.9% with annual gross written premium of $26.5bn. Life insurance penetration has dropped from <a href="https://policyholder.gov.in/uploads/CEDocuments/annual_rep_2008_09.pdf">4.0% in 2008</a> to <a href="https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/asia/news/breaking-news/pandemic-drives-insurance-penetration-in-india-303124.aspx">3.2% in 2021</a>.</p><p>Policybazaar has played a pivotal role in upgrading India's insurance industry to what it is today. As insurance customers, today we'll not settle for anything less than an interface with transparent pricing, full feature comparison, no/limited jargon and more. Policybazaar is the one to push that envelope along with others on the way. Even today, it's among the most recognisable brands for insurance - 126mm unique people visit its platform annually. PB Fintech has raised over $400mm till date <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWp9DojwMVs">with 60-64% of the money still in the bank </a>(as per the Management). It has spent cumulatively $140mm to build the brands of Policybazaar and Paisabazaar. The company looks to list at a <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/policybazaar-raises-rs-2569-crore-from-insurance-cos-others-in-ipo-anchor-round/articleshow/87376904.cms?from=mdr">valuation of $6.15bn</a>.</p><p><strong>What does PB Fintech do?</strong> Yes, I realise that so far I've talked a lot about Policybazaar. Policybazaar alone is not the entire company. PB Fintech owns and operates two core brands:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Policybazaar - </strong><em><strong>the insurance distribution brand</strong></em>: Policybazaar is the brand where users can compare and purchase all types of insurance products. It is India's largest digital insurance marketplace with 93.4% market share (among insurance distributors) in terms of number of policies sold. Moreover, it has a 65.3% market share of all digital insurance sales in India. In FY2021, Policybazaar had 126mm unique visitors, 48m registered customers and 19mm insurance policies sold. In FY2021, Policybazaar originated $635mm in gross premiums (58% new premium) for its insurer partners. Policybazaar earns a commission for insurance distribution and had $82mm in revenue in FY2021, accounting for 68.5% of PB Fintech's total operating revenue.</p></li><li><p><strong>Paisabazaar - </strong><em><strong>the credit distribution brand</strong></em>: With Paisabazaar, users can compare and apply for all sorts of credit products including small ticket unsecured loans, credit cards, home loans, small business loans and more. Launched in 2014, Paisabazaar, as claimed by PB Fintech, is India's largest consumer credit marketplace with 53.7% market share, based on disbursals in FY2021. Paisabazaar offers free credit score access, with ~22.5mm customers having accessed their credit scores as on 30th Jun, 2021. 67-68% of disbursals were made to existing customers, largely sourced through Policybazaar. Credit score access works as customer acquisition strategy for the platform. In FY2021, it facilitated $394mm in total disbursals, whereas as on 30th Jun, 2021 it facilitated $133mm in total disbursals.

It says these stores will act as "Experience Centers" and give customers a local physical presence to resolve any queries or service requests. This is a big departure from the online-only approach it's had so far and indicates that PB Fintech concedes that market expansion and distribution will only happen if one's present offline.</p><p>PB Fintech expanded to Dubai and the broader GCC region and plans to enter South East Asia at some point. It's been in Dubai since 2019 and is currently earning meager revenue of $1+mm in FY2021.</p><p>Policybazaar so far operated with a "Web Aggregator" license as per IRDAI but received its broker license in Jun, 2021. With a broker license, Policybazaar can "represent" its customers and handle claims process along with servicing them offline through Point of Sale Person (POSP).</p><p><strong>What's the market size?</strong> India's insurance industry is expected to grow at 17.8% CAGR from $102bn in FY2020 to $520bn by FY2030. From FY2020 to FY2030, Life insurance is expected to grow at 18.8%, health at 15.3% and non-life insurance at 13.5% CAGR. In the <a href="https://fintechinside.substack.com/p/thirtyseven">Fintech Business Model Deep Dive on Digit Insurance</a>, I discussed the insurance penetration levels in India - sum assured as a % of GDP is lowest in the world at 25% (China - 95%, USA - 265%). India mortality protection gap as a percentage of protection was at 83.0% in 2019, one of highest in the world, despite Indian households being disproportionately dependent on a single income earner. Furthermore, In 2018, India's health expenditure was the lowest globally at $73 per capita (China $501, USA - $1,111) resulting in 63% of health expenses being met out of pocket. As on FY2020, India's premium via online channels was only 1% of total industry premium (China - 5.5%, USA - 13.3%).</p><p>India's consumer credit market stood at $486bn as on FY2021, expected to grow to $1,055bn by FY2030 representing an 8% CAGR. Personal loans, home loans, credit cards and other consumer durable loans are expected to make up a chunk of the consumer credit sector. In terms of credit outstanding to GDP ratio, personal loan penetration stood at 3.3% in FY2021. Credit card market is expected to grow at 29.7% p.a. to reach $016bn in disbursal by FY2030 from $10bn in FY2021. India had very low housing credit penetration in terms of the outstanding housing loan as % of GDP, which stands at only 11.4% in FY2021 (China - 41.2%, USA - 57.8%). Lastly, there are only 300mm people in India with a credit score i.e. 22% of the population.</p><p><strong>How was PB Fintech's financial performance? </strong>In FY2021, PB Fintech made cumulative income of $129mm - 63% from insurance biz. It's cumulative revenue grew 12% YoY from $116mm in FY2020. Insurance biz is ~60%, other operating revenue accounts for 30% and 10% from other income.</p><p>Employee expenses and advertising expenses account for the major chunk of expenses i.e. 96.3% of total income in FY2021 vs. 113% in FY2020 and 141% in FY2019. PB Fintech makes a contribution profit, in FY2021, contribution profit was $47.7mm (39.8% of total income).</p><p>PB Fintech has so far not made a profit with total losses of $20mm in FY2021 ($41mm in FY2020 and $46mm in FY2019). An important indicator of improved performance is that its premium per advisor: $190K in FY2021, $115K in FY2020 and $85K in FY2019. The big jump in premium per advisor between FY2020 to FY2021 was on account of 1,900 people being laid off during covid in FY2021.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F97ee9907-c64a-425b-b1a8-4e7bbf13587b_1918x1053.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F97ee9907-c64a-425b-b1a8-4e7bbf13587b_1918x1053.png" width="1456" height="799" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/97ee9907-c64a-425b-b1a8-4e7bbf13587b_1918x1053.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:799,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:113100,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;PB Fintech&#8217;s Financial Performance &quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="PB Fintech&#8217;s Financial Performance " title="PB Fintech&#8217;s Financial Performance " srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F97ee9907-c64a-425b-b1a8-4e7bbf13587b_1918x1053.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F97ee9907-c64a-425b-b1a8-4e7bbf13587b_1918x1053.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F97ee9907-c64a-425b-b1a8-4e7bbf13587b_1918x1053.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F97ee9907-c64a-425b-b1a8-4e7bbf13587b_1918x1053.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">PB Fintech&#8217;s Financial Performance </figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>Who is PB Fintech competing with? </strong>Technically, PB Fintech's Policybazaar is competing with insurers and other agent-driven insurance distribution startups. Insurers are starting to double down on their own digital channels. In fact, In March, 2021 Policybazaar had 52 insurer partners, and that number dropped to 48 as on Sept, 2021. So, insurers are dropping off. HDFC Ergo <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/the-growing-dissonance-between-online-insurance-aggregators-and-insurers/articleshow/84958092.cms">delisted it's entire product offering</a> from Policybazaar post Sept, 2021 and other insurers are also following suit.</p><p>Throughout the RHP and even in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWp9DojwMVs">analyst call</a>, PB Fintech emphasized consistently that its brands are its biggest competitive moats. Even Paisabazaar depends heavily on the Policybazaar brand evidenced by the fact that 67-68% of disbursals being sourced through Policybazaar.</p><p><strong>What does the future look like for PB Fintech?</strong> PB Fintech believes its strengths lie in its brand, repeat usage and growth flywheel, its capital efficient business model and its "founders' clarity of purpose". PB Fintech plans to double down on its brand recognition to maintain its leadership position for both business verticals.</p><p>PB Fintech's plans include (a) deepening its India presence - largely on the back of offline store expansion, (b) replicating its success in the corporate and SMB segments, (c) continued investment in brand and technology, (d) strategic investments - started off with acquisition of DocPrime and Visit Health. and lastly (e) international expansion. </p><p>Maintaining its leadership position will pose the biggest challenge for PB Fintech as competition is increasingly going direct to consumer. PB Fintech has ample capital to tackle any challenges in the short term. Besides, India's digital insurance market is only 1% done, literally. The market has a long way to go with much more disruption ahead of it, aside from the market having enough depth to accommodate multiple Policybazaar's.</p><p><em>What was your takeaway from this IPO Prospectus breakdown?

You can find the full list of fintech <a href="https://twifasia.substack.com/p/this-week-in-fintech-asia-30th-oct">fund raise announcements here</a>.</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>: Not sure if this is a rush to announce fund raises before Diwali but $800+mm in a week is a first for me. This is also important, as the $800mm is not 80-90% fund raise of one startup. 6 startups announced raising $40+mm! What's more, there was no concentration of sectors where capital was deployed. This week startups from sectors including wealth, insurance, fintech infrastructure, taxation, banking, SMB and consumer finance, payments and more raised funding.</p><p>From the several investors that I speak to, fintech startups will only continue to dominate Indian startup funding. Many more startups are yet to announce their fund raises. Indian fintech is witnessing a huge second wave (first was in 2016/2017 when payments and credit were grabbing millions in funding). Will we soon see fintech startups cumulative announce raising a billion dollars in a week? I sure hope so, and I'll be here for that.</p><p><strong>2&#65039;&#8419; Card tokenisation products launched in India</strong></p><p>Razorpay <a href="https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/razorpay-launches-tokenisation-in-partnership-with-mastercard-rupay-and-visa-11634950741476.html">launched</a> TokenHQ and PayU <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/payu-launches-tokenisation-solution-payu-token-hub-with-visa-mastercard-7641721.html">launched</a> Token Hub. TokenHQ and Token Hub are both tokenisation products by the two largest payment platforms in India. Both these products are multi-card network tokenisation where Razorpay offers tokenisation for VISA, Mastercard and RuPay and PayU offers it with VISA and Mastercard. Tokenisation will be available to all existing merchants of both companies.</p><p><strong>What's tokenisation and why launch these products?</strong> As per RBI, "<em>Tokenisation refers to replacement of actual card details with an unique alternate code called the &#8220;token&#8221;, which shall be unique for a combination of card, token requestor and device</em>". In Jan, 2019, <a href="https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11449&amp;Mode=0">RBI introduced tokenisation</a> for card transactions and then in Sept, 2021 RBI <a href="https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12159&amp;Mode=0">permitted tokenisation</a> for card-on-file transactions as well. In Mar, 2021, RBI also, more importantly, <a href="https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12050&amp;Mode=0">disallowed</a> payment aggregators and merchants from storing card data on file. Basically, RBI wants to improve security of card transactions by not allowing entities to store card data which could get stolen in case of a data breach.</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>: The deadline for entities to comply with RBI's tokenisation regulations is 31st December, 2021. From 1st Jan, 2022, all entities except card issuers and card networks, will not be able to store card data. Any card data stored will have to be purged. This will not change anything at the consumer end, other than the additional factor of authentication as required. Most of the tokenisation will happen at the backend which is where TokenHQ and Token Hub come in. Like we're currently witnessing with recurring payments in India, there will be a couple of weeks of payment issues when the tokenisation deadline expires.</p><p><strong>3&#65039;&#8419; South East Asia Round up</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Kakao Pay</strong>, South Korea's largest payments company, <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/ipo/2021/kakao-pays-seoul-ipo-raises-1-3b-at-top-of-range/">to list on the Seoul exchanges</a> to raise $1.3bn at top of range.</p></li><li><p><strong>Nium</strong> <a href="https://www.wcax.com/prnewswire/2021/10/25/nium-launches-first-global-platform-crypto-as-a-service-extends-its-banking-as-a-service-solution-us/">launched</a> a global platform for Crypto-as-a-Service.</p></li><li><p><strong>Swiss fintech</strong> companies are <a href="https://fintechnews.sg/56635/fintech/swiss-fintech-companies-show-increased-presence-in-singapore/">increasingly</a> opening up offices in Singapore for access to South East Asia.</p></li><li><p><strong>Partior</strong>, a blockchain based settlement and clearing platform, <a href="https://fintechnews.sg/56658/blockchain/partior-pilots-sgd-and-usd-settlements-in-near-real-time-with-participating-banks/">piloted</a> SGD and USD settlements in near real time with participating banks.</p></li><li><p><strong>OJK</strong>, Indonesia's central bank, <a href="https://kr-asia.com/indonesian-financial-regulator-releases-blueprint-for-digital-banking">released</a> a digital banking blueprint.

Will we see an encore from Kakao Pay as well? We'll have to wait till 5th Nov when IPO subscription closes.</p><p>South East Asian countries are also attempting to be the crypto and fintech innovation hub in the eastern hemisphere. Nium, a Singaporean fintech startup launching a "crypto-as-a-service" product is testament. Further, Partior, formed by DBS, J.P. Morgan and Temasek in Singapore launched a clearing platform built on the blockchain to facilitate cross border payments. Piloting its SGD-USD payment rails is big progress. DBS is also now part of the Hedera Governing council which has developed the "only public decentralized distributed ledger that utilizes the fast, fair, and secure hashgraph consensus mechanism." It claims to be better than blockchain technology.

The proposed $2.2bn IPO will be India's largest IPO ever. Paytm was reportedly seeking a <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/paytm-files-for-india-s-largest-ipo-eyes-25-bn-30-bn-valuation-121071601614_1.html">$25-30bn valuation</a>, even though its <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/pre-ipo-placement-trouble-punishes-paytm-shares-in-unlisted-market/articleshow/87208074.cms">pre-IPO placement was unsuccessful</a> because of valuation differences.

Founded in 2000 and launching its payments platform in 2009, Paytm has constantly evolved/pivoted to become the most recognisable mobile payments brand in India. Paytm at its peak, dominated India's consumer payments landscape, thanks in a large way for making QR code payments ubiquitous in India. Pre-UPI, the entire country was plastered with only Paytm's QR code. Then with UPI's launch in 2016, Paytm lost its prepaid wallet dominance to platforms like PhonePe, BharatPe and GooglePay that offered instant transfers from bank accounts.</p><p>Paytm still claims to be India's largest payments company with a 40% market share of overall payments transaction volume and 65-70% market share of the wallet payments transactions volume. Paytm continues to make its presence felt by getting into related financial services, at one point <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/rana-kapoor-in-talks-with-paytm-founder-to-sell-stake-in-yes-bank/articleshow/71073853.cms">wanting to acquire an Indian bank</a> but later <a href="https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/paytm-not-interested-in-buying-stake-in-yes-bank-vijay-shekhar-11578503630137.html">denying it</a>.

As on FY21, Paytm processed $54.5bn in GMV (excludes P2P transfers).</p></li><li><p><strong>Commerce and Cloud Services</strong>: Paytm's commerce offering includes travel ticketing, event and entertainment ticketing, advertising, gaming, Android "mini-app" store and a <a href="https://paytmmall.com/">full ecommerce platform through Paytm Mall</a>. Under Cloud services, Paytm offers loyalty management, billing and ledger management, online storefront, CRM and others. It also offers "Paytm AI (PAI Cloud)" which is its fraud prevention, customer engagement and analytics suite. Paytm calls it a "Cloud" offering, but its really a SaaS offering. As on FY21, Paytm processed $573mm of Commerce GMV.</p></li><li><p><strong>Financial Services</strong>: This is where Paytm's financial super app comes becomes whole. It offers deposit accounts through its payment bank, loans for consumers and merchants, attachment insurance products and wealth and investment products. Other than loans, Paytm offers financial products through its own group companies. As its a payment bank it can only facilitate loan products in partnership with other platforms. As on FY21, Paytm has 64mm deposit accounts and $702mm in deposits, 11.3mm unique insurance customers and combined AuM of $702mm across mutual funds, gold and stock broking.</p></li></ol><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F687eca6a-7453-4043-878e-f6d38bc2388c_1024x561.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F687eca6a-7453-4043-878e-f6d38bc2388c_1024x561.png" width="1024" height="561" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/687eca6a-7453-4043-878e-f6d38bc2388c_1024x561.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:561,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:241390,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Paytm&#8217;s comprehensive offering for consumers and merchants&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Paytm&#8217;s comprehensive offering for consumers and merchants" title="Paytm&#8217;s comprehensive offering for consumers and merchants" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F687eca6a-7453-4043-878e-f6d38bc2388c_1024x561.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F687eca6a-7453-4043-878e-f6d38bc2388c_1024x561.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F687eca6a-7453-4043-878e-f6d38bc2388c_1024x561.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F687eca6a-7453-4043-878e-f6d38bc2388c_1024x561.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Paytm&#8217;s comprehensive offering for consumers and merchants</figcaption></figure></div><p>Paytm has 333mm customers and 21mm merchants across its ecosystem. It also has "<em>operations in Canada, Singapore, UAE, Malaysia, Tanzania, Uganda and Bangladesh, among others</em>". In 2017 it launched bill payments in Canada and in 2018 it partnered with Softbank to launch PayPay in Japan. As on FY21 it had 8,623 on roll employees (3,989 for sales, 2,550 for tech and product). The most fascinating part (IMO) of the entire IPO prospectus, is that <strong>the Paytm brand alone is valued at $6.3bn</strong>, making "Paytm" the most valuable payments brand!</p><p><strong>What's the market size in which Paytm operates?</strong> Paytm operates in two very large markets - commerce and financial services. As pointed out in the <a href="https://fintechinside.substack.com/p/fortyone">MobiKwik IPO prospectus breakdown</a>, the market size is only growing.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Payments Digitisation</strong>: India is projected to have 1bn internet users (70% of population) by FY26. Digital payments is going to evolve to serve these 1bn users and new payment methods are changing the way people transact. In FY21, the digital payments market size was $~20tn and is expected to grow at a ~17% CAGR to $~40-50tn by FY26. Mobile payments market size is also expected to grow 5x from $608bn in FY21 to $~3tn in FY26.</p></li><li><p><strong>Increasing Merchant Digital Payment Adoption</strong>: Between FY21 to FY26, India's SMB merchants are expected to grow by 5% from 65mm to 80-85mm. During the same period, digitally enabled merchants are expected to grow 9% from 45mm (69% of total) to 70mm (84% of total) and merchants using QR for payments is expected to grow 12% from 30-35mm (49% of total) to 55-60mm (69% of total).</p></li><li><p><strong>Commerce</strong>: Paytm operates across ticketing, retail, gaming and advertising in Commerce. Retail is the largest market at $41bn in FY21, expected to grow at a 28-31% CAGR to $140-160bn in FY26. Travel ticketing comes in second at $36bn market size, expected to grow at a ~9% CAGR to $60bn by FY26. Online gaming, entertainment ticketing, grocery and others are $3-9bn in market size growing significantly till FY26.</p></li><li><p><strong>Financial Services</strong>: Each vertical within financial services is large driven by under penetration, presenting an opportunity. BNPL market is expected to grow 5x from $15-20bn in FY21 to $90-100bn by FY26. 63mm SMB's employ 110mm people but only 20% of the credit demand is met by formal sector. Insurance penetration stands at 3.8% compared to global average of 7.2%. Non-life insurance market is expected to grow at 15% CAGR to reach $50-60bn by FY26. Investors in stocks and mutual funds are expected to 2x to 80mm by FY26 and total investment in the sector is expected to grow 2.6x to $1.2tn by FY26.</p></li></ol><p>Paytm is hoping for growth coming on the back of digital GDP growth, pace of digitisation, digital payments and under penetration. The same was detailed out in <a href="https://fintechinside.substack.com/p/fortyone">Edition #41</a> so I'm not repeating it here, for brevity.</p><p><strong>How was Paytm's financial performance?</strong> Paytm's total annual income stood at $431mm for FY21 representing a 10% YoY degrowth from $478mm in FY20. Revenue from Payments and Financial Services vertical made up 66% of the total income, with YoY growth of 11% and 12% for FY20-21 and FY19-20 respectively. Revenue from Commerce and Cloud verticals have significantly reduced between FY19-21 from $208mm in FY19 to $94mm in FY21.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F992ef6ba-5545-4dd2-9303-69beeeeb6d13_1024x502.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F992ef6ba-5545-4dd2-9303-69beeeeb6d13_1024x502.png" width="1024" height="502" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/992ef6ba-5545-4dd2-9303-69beeeeb6d13_1024x502.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:502,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:154812,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Paytm&#8217;s annual financial performance&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Paytm&#8217;s annual financial performance" title="Paytm&#8217;s annual financial performance" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F992ef6ba-5545-4dd2-9303-69beeeeb6d13_1024x502.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F992ef6ba-5545-4dd2-9303-69beeeeb6d13_1024x502.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F992ef6ba-5545-4dd2-9303-69beeeeb6d13_1024x502.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F992ef6ba-5545-4dd2-9303-69beeeeb6d13_1024x502.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Paytm&#8217;s annual financial performance</figcaption></figure></div><p>Total expenses stood at $646mm in FY21, reducing 21-22% yearly between FY19-21.

Paytm intends to use 52% if the IPO proceeds to grow the existing Paytm ecosystem (marketing spends, merchant acquisition etc.). 24% of the IPO proceeds will be used for new business initiatives on commerce and financial services and the rest of the IPO proceeds for general corporate expenses.</p><p>Given that most of Paytm's financial services (insurance, wealth etc.) products were launched only post 2017, growth of this business vertical will be a major growth driver for Paytm in the future. The commerce piece is a little confusing to me because that vertical has played an increasingly smaller role in Paytm's growth. It only feeds consumers with more reasons to come back to the Paytm app.</p><p>Back in 2017, I had an opportunity to invest in Paytm at a $~6bn valuation. At that time, I didn't think there was any upside and had never seen a startup grow significantly beyond that valuation and Paytm's losses were unlike any I'd seen back then. Clearly I was foolish, as Paytm will be valued at 3-5x that at IPO with more potential upside at this scale. If you read my <a href="https://fintechinside.substack.com/p/fintech-inside-22-27th-feb-2021-cred">CRED deep dive</a>, you'd know I have immense respect for the senior management at Paytm and those that have moved on to start their own businesses. Paytm has played a pivotal role in Indian fintech in many aspects and its amazing to see it will soon list on the Indian stock exchanges.</p><p><em>What was your takeaway from this IPO Prospectus breakdown?

Both card networks already have BNPL/installment programs live in various countries globally.</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>: Do you think VISA and Mastercard (V/MC) will ever get disrupted? I can't seem to think of any circumstance where that's a reality. We thought UPI would do the trick but V/MC only grew stronger. The V/MC network effects are just too strong. Moreover, other payment methods are free, meaning banks don't make any money, which incentivises banks to use platforms that make money for them - enter V/MC. Credit card, as a payment method, is the highest revenue earner for everyone in the payments value chain. Next time you make a payment, pause and look at the order in which you're shown payment options - top most earns the most revenue. BNPL poses an even higher revenue potential.</p><p>BNPL is a merchant and bank network game. Anyone with the largest network at both ends wins. V/MC are doubling down on their network effects by pushing another credit product down the pipe. It works beautifully for them. It's also the reason why they wanted to acquire Plaid (data network) and are now building a crypto network (payment networks of the future). The more products they push down the pipe, the more value it adds to everyone in the network and V/MC become even more central to the entire value chain.</p><p>However, V/MC are currently live in credit card dense countries - US, UK and Australia. India will be the first (per surface level research that I've done) low credit card penetration country that these networks will launch in. Why this matters? It's not clear how this BNPL/installment-as-a-service platform will work without cards in the picture. <a href="https://usa.visa.com/partner-with-us/payment-technology/installments.html">VISA lays out</a> how the transaction will work pre-purchase, during purchase and post-purchase - but they all require a card. Lastly, this "credit network" is what India's Open Credit Enablement Network (OCEN) was supposed to do but that's yet to see the light of day.</p><p><strong>2&#65039;&#8419; Registered Investment Advisors banned from advising on unregulated financial products</strong></p><p>SEBI (India's securities regulator) <a href="https://www.sebi.gov.in/media/press-releases/oct-2021/dealing-in-unregulated-products-by-sebi-registered-investment-advisers_53370.html">put out a notification</a> for Registered Investment Advisors (RIA), <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-bans-investment-advisors-from-advising-on-unregulated-instruments-7609621.html">barring them</a> from advising or "providing a platform for buying/ selling/ dealing in unregulated products including digital gold".</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>: It's surprising that SEBI has singled out digital gold in its notification. It could either be that digital gold has gained a lot of traction with users and so it's important enough or it could also be that SEBI was <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/market/bse-ready-with-technology-for-launching-electronic-gold-receipts/2342816/">given the mandate</a> to regulate the gold spot exchange and so it's doing this. This notification is also surprising as SEBI recently approved the framework to <a href="https://fintechinside.substack.com/p/thirtynine">launch a gold spot exchange</a> (<em>as mentioned in Edition #39</em>). With the Gold Spot Exchange, digital gold will become a regulated product. It's possible SEBI wants to curb digital gold's growth until all entities are compliant with the new framework.</p><p>There are 1,320 RIA's in India. Entities like Groww, Paytm and others who are RIA's and offer digital gold purchases will be impacted over the next 3-6 months or till the gold spot exchange goes live. Wealth products or investment products are typically monthly, quarterly or one time purchase products. Digital Gold made it a more frequent use case which in turn increased transactions, retention and other metrics for these platforms. This notification is being construed to include cryptocurrencies and will also include the newer fixed income products being offered by WintWealth, GripInvest and others. These platforms are not RIA's themselves but depend on RIA's for distribution. The notification will have adverse impact on these platforms at least for some time.</p><p><strong>3&#65039;&#8419; India's recurring payments fiasco</strong></p><p>It's been 23 days (as on the date of writing this) since RBI's recurring payments framework deadline came into effect and recurring payment failures <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/finance/new-recurring-payment-norms-20-days-later-people-still-face-disruptions-121102100188_1.html">have only been mounting</a>.

In Dec, 2020, <a href="https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12002&amp;Mode=0">RBI increased the limit</a> of recurring payments without the need for Additional Factor of Authentication (AFA) from INR 2,000 ($27) to INR 5,000 ($67.5). Lastly, in Mar, 2021, <a href="https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12051">RBI extended the deadline</a> to comply with the recurring payment framework from 31st Mar, 2021 to 30th Sept, 2021.</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>: Who's to blame here?

Moreover, the push for recurring payments on card framework was a push from the industry. Sure you can also blame Covid to have caused delays from the industry but the regulation has been in place for 2 years now. As with most things, we waited until the 11th hour. It seems merchants, non-regulated entities, were the non-compliant ones here, and it was the responsibility of the merchant acquirer (Pine Labs, HDFC Bank etc.) to ensure these merchants are compliant. The real issue comes for international merchants with no local entity but with users in India - how do these merchants comply with India's recurring payments framework? It's clear this is going to be a problem for a couple more weeks. Hang in there, founders!</p><p><strong>&#127873; Bonus: HSBC has a new business vertical</strong></p><p>HSBC in UK launched Banking as a Service business vertical and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hsbc-launch-banking-160000161.html?guccounter=1">partnered</a> with Oracle's NetSuite. HSBC's corporate banking solutions will be integrated in NetSuite's Cloud ERP. With this integration, NetSuite will embed automated banking features into its accounting software for businesses.</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>: Impressive move by two incumbents that I did not see coming. NetSuite has 27,000 enterprise customers globally. Apparently, HSBC is the first partner for NetSuite's ambition to offer embedded banking services. It's looking to partner with more such banks to automatically send and receive money, "<em>automate accounts payable, accounts receivable and reconciliation processes, making it fast and simple to pay bills, send invoices, get paid and gain full cash flow visibility, all from within a unified system.</em>"</p><p>This is the first time a major ERP provider has embedded banking services in its accounting platform. It's impressive that a major bank has decided to take this route too. There are many such partnerships in India between SMB accounting startups and banks but these partnerships are still superficial i.e. high level products are offered. We can only hope that product offerings go deeper to offer innovative capabilities to SMB's.</p><div><hr></div><blockquote><p><strong>Looking for the news digest? </strong>Read all the week&#8217;s fintech news and updates in India and SEA over at <a href="http://asia.thisweekinfintech.com">This Week in Fintech - India and SEA Edition</a>.

So I decided to solve my own problem. Here's a short summary of the 411-page draft IPO prospectus - for your reading pleasure.</p><p><em>Disclaimer: This post is purely intended for educational purposes. It is not investment advice and should not be construed as such. Please consult your investment advisor for such things. Further, this post is me cherry picking sections of the DRHP. <a href="https://www.sebi.gov.in/filings/public-issues/jul-2021/one-mobikwik-systems-limited_51019.html">Please read the DRHP for full context.</a> I am not directly or indirectly</em> <em>a shareholder in MobiKwik.</em></p><p>Founded in 2009, MobiKwik was a pioneer of the payment wallet in India. It claims to be the first to launch a payment wallet in 2009 and then among the first to launch a payment gateway in 2011 and a BNPL product in 2018. It's easy to forget that between 2010's to 2015's online payment was extremely cumbersome. MobiKwik's open loop wallet allowed a level of convenience that was unmatched for digital, instant payments. There was fierce competition with Paytm, also a wallet at the time, but Paytm diluted its wallet offering in favour of UPI post UPI's launch in 2016. The entire financial services sector was sure that MobiKwik's moats would be wiped out with UPI - and it did. But MobiKwik stuck to its guns and continues to use the wallet as a core part of its business. With RBI's recent suggestions around credit on UPI, it seems that the wallet might make a comeback, giving MobiKwik some advantage. In the twelve years since founding, MobiKwik has raised $165-200mm and was last <a href="https://www.livemint.com/companies/start-ups/mobikwik-is-now-a-unicorn-as-staffers-exercise-esop-option-11634064019034.html">valued at $1bn</a> and en ESOP buyback. The company now received SEBI (securities regulator) approval to float its IPO, hopefully before Diwali (4th Nov), where the company intends to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/indian-financial-services-firm-mobikwik-looks-to-raise-255-million-in-ipo/">raise $201mm via fresh issue</a> at a valuation of $1.5-1.7bn.</p><p><strong>What does MobiKwik do again?</strong> MobiKwik is a payments startup offering 3 core products.</p><ol><li><p><strong>ZaakPay </strong><em>(Payment Gateway)</em>: The core engine on which MobiKwik runs. Zaakpay is used by MobiKwik itself, as a customer, and by other businesses as well.</p></li><li><p><strong>MobiKwik Wallet</strong> <em>(Wallet)</em>: Wallet is the consumer-facing business that offers an open loop, prepaid wallet for payments, bills and others. Wallet has 101.4mm registered users and 41.6mm KYC'd users as on 31st March, 2021. 77% of its registered users were acquired organically in FY21. MobiKwik issued 1.1mm MobiKwik Blue American Express Cards.</p></li><li><p><strong>MobiKwik Zip</strong> <em>(BNPL offering)</em>: MobiKwik Zip is a BNPL offering with two sub-products, Zip - interest free BNPL with credit limit up to INR 30K ($405) and repayment within 15 days, and Zip EMI - an interest-bearing, equated monthly repayment credit line with limit up to INR 100K ($1,351) with tenor of 6/12/18 months. 22.25mm users have been pre-approved for MobiKwik Zip as on 31st March, 2021, and MobiKwik Zip users repeat rate was 79.2% in FY21. As on 31st March, 2021, there were 11,351 (+363% YoY) merchants which registered at least one BNPL transaction.</p></li><li><p><strong>Non-core offering (cross sell)</strong>: MobiKwik wants to capitalise on this massive user base by cross selling other financial products. It started offering mutual fund investing options through its acquisition of ClearFunds in 2018. MobiKwik already facilitates $53.5mm (+38% YoY) in annual AuM. It's second cross sell offering is insurance for which is received an IRDAI (insurance regulator) corporate agent license.</p></li></ol><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f94c2de-ee1a-4458-95fe-35c0f5e5aae6_1024x564.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f94c2de-ee1a-4458-95fe-35c0f5e5aae6_1024x564.png" width="1024" height="564" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0f94c2de-ee1a-4458-95fe-35c0f5e5aae6_1024x564.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:564,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:134649,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;MobiKwik's Products&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="MobiKwik's Products" title="MobiKwik's Products" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f94c2de-ee1a-4458-95fe-35c0f5e5aae6_1024x564.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f94c2de-ee1a-4458-95fe-35c0f5e5aae6_1024x564.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f94c2de-ee1a-4458-95fe-35c0f5e5aae6_1024x564.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f94c2de-ee1a-4458-95fe-35c0f5e5aae6_1024x564.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">MobiKwik's Products</figcaption></figure></div><p>MobiKwik has a total of 101.4mm registered users in its network and 3.44mm merchants, including over 3.37mm physical stores, 73K online merchants and 283 billers.

The consolidated GMV declined 30% from $2.9bn in FY20 to $2.0bn in FY21. Consolidated operating revenues declined 19% from $49.9mm in FY20 to $40.9mm in FY21. Total consolidated revenues declined 18% during the same period. 49% of the $40.9mm in FY21 came from its consumer wallet business, 37% came from its payment gateway business and the rest from BNPL. It is a loss-making business, registering -34% EBITDA margins and -38% PAT margins. Total loss increased in FY21 to $15.0mm from $13mm in FY20 and $20mm in FY19.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F792efbd5-ef60-4aca-ae6e-7c9ac57532e0_1024x564.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F792efbd5-ef60-4aca-ae6e-7c9ac57532e0_1024x564.png" width="1024" height="564" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/792efbd5-ef60-4aca-ae6e-7c9ac57532e0_1024x564.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:564,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:143459,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;MobiKwik's consolidated and segment financial performance&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="MobiKwik's consolidated and segment financial performance" title="MobiKwik's consolidated and segment financial performance" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F792efbd5-ef60-4aca-ae6e-7c9ac57532e0_1024x564.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F792efbd5-ef60-4aca-ae6e-7c9ac57532e0_1024x564.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F792efbd5-ef60-4aca-ae6e-7c9ac57532e0_1024x564.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F792efbd5-ef60-4aca-ae6e-7c9ac57532e0_1024x564.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">MobiKwik's consolidated and segment financial performance</figcaption></figure></div><p>At a product level, MobiKwik is making a meager 8% gross profit.

BNPL will be a key role in driving MobiKwik's profitability as it can only make 1.0-1.5% margin on payments GMV. To enable this, it will have to constantly use transactions data and fine tune its MobiScore. Everything else will be in the hands of the market. The payments sector is still as hot as it was 5-7 years ago. The jury is still out there on who's won the payments sector, we still have a long way to go. If <a href="https://the-captable.com/2021/10/digital-wallets-comeback-upi-credit-ppi-mdr-interchange-npci/">RBI has its way</a>, wallets might become "sexy" again, making credit on UPI available with wallets only. The business has shown resilience in the past and survived severe market competition. It's no doubt that MobiKwik will continue to build a meaningful business and grow at a decent pace. The first fintech startup to IPO is always reason to cheer. Wishing the folks at MobiKwik great success in the public markets!</p><p><strong>1-min Anonymous Feedback:</strong> Your feedback helps me improve this newsletter.

The new small finance bank is named Unity Small Finance Bank. The license approval is subject to Unity SFB acquiring crisis-hit PMC Bank. The same day the license was given out, BharatPe <a href="https://www.livemint.com/companies/people/former-sbi-chairman-rajnish-kumar-joins-bharatpe-board-as-chairman-11634015216123.html">announced the appointment</a> of Rajnish Kumar, the former Chairman of SBI Bank, as the Chairman of the Board of BharatPe.</p><p>What is a Small Finance Bank (SFB)? A SFB is a niche type of bank <a href="https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/bs_viewcontent.aspx?Id=2901">created by RBI</a> to further financial inclusion. It can operate like a standard bank by providing deposits, savings and credit products but 25% of the branch network in a fiscal year will have to be in unbanked rural areas (&lt;9,999 population). As per RBI, the SFB, will have to facilitate "<em>supply of credit to small business units; small and marginal farmers; micro and small industries; and other unorganised sector entities, through high technology-low cost operations.</em>"</p><p><strong>Takeaways:</strong> This is big for the fintech sector. A 3-year old startup, forming a JV and receiving a banking license is massive, several financial services veterans/firms have tried. Ashneer Grover, founder of BharatPe, <a href="https://ivmpodcasts.com/paisavaisa-episode-list/tag/BharatPe">has always maintained </a>that in India, a business can never make money on payments and his plans were to lend to the merchant and its customers. With this banking license, BharatPe will be able to lend with potentially the lowest interest rates for merchants out there. As per news reports, BharatPe intends to position Unity SFB as a merchant focused bank which plays well into its mission. The appointment of Rajnish Kumar is a master stroke - builds confidence with RBI and is great brand to have on your side when you want to raise low cost debt from the global markets.</p><p>BharatPe has <a href="https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/bharatpe-turns-towards-loyalty-based-qr-11632988020945.html">7.5mm merchant network</a> using the payments platform and processes $10bn of payments annually. Payback, a loyalty and rewards platform acquired by BharatPe, has <a href="https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/bharatpe-turns-towards-loyalty-based-qr-11632988020945.html">130mm retail users</a> with annual merchandise value of $8bn. PMC Bank has <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/finance/banks/news/pmc-bank-will-have-a-new-owner-in-centrum-and-bharatpe/articleshow/83639668.cms">1.6mm account holders</a>. That's a lot of customers to work with and lend to.</p><p>But this could very well be RBI's reaction to save the $1.35bn in deposits of account holders of PMC Bank. RBI has always done everything in it's power to save a bank in the past. Everything. RBI put PMC Bank under moratorium in Sep, 2019. There were potentially no other suitors to acquire this bank and so RBI might have been desperate here. This in no way takes away from BharatPe's ambition and strategic moves. It's probably wise of Ashneer as founder to hire the best and smartest people from financial services to run the show.</p><p><em>Side Note: Ribbit Capital, <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/01/11/walmart-announces-creation-of-new-fintech-startup">fintech solution partner to Walmart</a> and early investor in BharatPe, now indirectly owns a small share in an Indian Bank and <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/walmarts-partner-ribbit-capital-invests-in-bank-jago-indonesias-first-full-digital-bank">directly in Indonesian Bank - Bank Jago</a>.</em></p><p>2&#65039;&#8419; <strong>Pine Labs entered the hyper competitive Indian online payments market</strong></p><p>Pine Labs, a POS payments company, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/pine-labs-launches-payment-gateway-platform-plural/articleshow/87019191.cms">launched</a> Plural, an online payment gateway product. Plural has three products - Plural Checkout, Plural Gateway and Plural Console. Plural has been in stealth for some months now and already processes $150-200mm in monthly payments. Merchants like Croma, Cred and Reliance Digital have already been using the product.</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>: This is a really smart move for the company to capitalise on existing merchant base. Omni channel payment acceptance is a very compelling offering. Pine Labs has a lofty goal of processing $25bn in online payments within 18 months. It's relatively easy for a company offering POS payment acceptance to transition to online as opposed to an online one extending to offline POS payments. But that's not to discount the extremely competitive payments markets in India. After <a href="https://fintechinside.substack.com/p/thirtysix">PayU India acquired BillDesk</a> a few weeks back, India's payment market was sort of a duopoly between PayU and Razorpay. (I didn't consider Paytm, PhonePe and Mobikwik because they have a consumer focus and are not true merchant payments gateways).</p><p>By now owning the omni-channel checkout real estate, Pine Labs will find itself in a position of leverage with merchants. Pine Labs is known to have largely enterprise customers. In <a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/pine-labs-forays-into-online-payments-eyes-25-bn-annual-payments-volume-in-the-next-18-months/">India and Malaysia</a>, Pine Labs has 140K merchants, 350K POS terminals and processes $~30bn. The challenge is that Covid forced businesses to integrate payment gateways for online payment acceptance and that was probably won by PayU or Razorpay. Will Plural really be able get these businesses to use the platform? Time will tell but businesses, especially large ones, typically have multiple payment partners to keep pricing in check and to ensure redundancy.</p><p><strong>3&#65039;&#8419; Indian film actors are boarding the crypto train!</strong></p><p>Indian film actors Amitabh Bachchan and Ranveer Singh <a href="https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/corporate/story/coinswitch-kuber-onboards-ranveer-singh-as-brand-ambassador-after-coindcx-roped-in-amitabh-bachchan-308835-2021-10-08">have signed on as brand ambassadors</a> of CoinDCX and CoinSwitch respectively. Amitabh is, however, <a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/coindcx-puts-ad-campaign-with-amitabh-bachchan-on-hold/">having second thoughts</a> now. Actor Salman Khan announced the launch of <a href="https://www.bollycoin.com/">BollyCoin</a>, a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F38p5R4Le4FBswk_nG79xSqFABb7anQN/view">Bollywood focused NFT marketplace</a>. Lastly, actor Suniel Shetty <a href="https://www.indianweb2.com/2021/10/bollywood-star-sunil-shetty-invests-in.html">invested</a> in in NFT marketplace Colexion's latest funding round..</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>: Diwali season has always been great for India. Actors, startups, cricketers - everyone capitalises on it. Amitabh and Ranveer are among the first Indian actors to become brand ambassadors of crypto startups. It's obviously great for the crypto ecosystem as they actors will help bring these startups to the masses (outside of crypto Twitter). The most interesting update is that from actor Salman Khan - launching an NFT marketplace. The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F38p5R4Le4FBswk_nG79xSqFABb7anQN/view?usp=sharing">whitepaper on BollyCoin</a> makes for a great read. This startup, in partnership with the Salman Khan's and his brothers' production houses will mint audio and video clips, movie stills and posters into NFT's for the masses to bid on and own. On similar lines, Colexion is another startup with the same premise that raised funding from actor Suniel Shetty. Salman Khan has a mass appeal like no other, which to me, will help sensitise people regarding NFT's.

It would come as no surprise if you're be able to name 10 or more listed brands in the US alone. And that's what today's post is about.</p><p>We've all heard the the saying "<em>invest in stocks of companies whose products you use</em>". Warren Buffet famously champions this by eating at McDonalds and Sees Candy and drinking coke almost everyday. For years, Indians haven't followed this advise and instead relied on friends and family. But this advise is making a come back - largely driven by Indian startups providing US stock investment products. Seeing the growth of NYSE and NASDAQ has prompted many investors to diversify their portfolio with some exposure to US stocks. These platforms also aim to provide global stock investing features. But that's exactly where the "advice" falls apart.</p><p>US stock markets <a href="https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/should-you-be-investing-in-us-equity-markets-11611072259273.html">account for 65% of the MSCI World Index</a>. The <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Markets/Currencies/US-dollar-loses-shine-as-reserve-currency-for-emerging-economies">share of the US Dollar</a> to total global assets was 59% in 2020 (lowest in 25 years). The <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/the-international-role-of-the-u-s-dollar-20211006.htm">US Dollar was used for 70-80% of all transactions</a> in global trade - a share that's remained stable for 20 years! So, yes - US companies dominate a large part of the global economy. And this has translated to everyone - governments, companies and individuals, wanting to own a piece of the US Dollar or a US company. Participation in the stock exchanges outside the US is limited. This is largely because other markets are very regional and business is also concentrated within those regions. Regional, cultural and language barriers cause brands to be well known locally but unheard of globally.</p><p>Moreover, as mentioned, us Indians barely apply this "advice" to our own Indian companies. Ever had Diamond's potato chips? Do you own <a href="https://finmedium.com/2020/10/prataap-snacks-indian-namkeen/">Prataap Snacks</a>? Ever painted the walls of your home? Do you own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Paints">Asian Paints</a>? Bought Jockey under garments? Do you own Page Industries? Obviously you have Starbucks coffee, do you own <a href="https://www.tataconsumer.com/">TATA Consumer</a>? In fact, we typically apply stringent filters while buying stocks of these companies. Similarly, it's unlikely that Indians will want exposure to stocks of other markets - outside the US. Does this then reduce the market size of such startups?</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5daab13-56c5-46f2-bc6f-dde2c6bc3d36_1024x267.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5daab13-56c5-46f2-bc6f-dde2c6bc3d36_1024x267.png" width="1024" height="267" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c5daab13-56c5-46f2-bc6f-dde2c6bc3d36_1024x267.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:267,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:79318,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5daab13-56c5-46f2-bc6f-dde2c6bc3d36_1024x267.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5daab13-56c5-46f2-bc6f-dde2c6bc3d36_1024x267.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5daab13-56c5-46f2-bc6f-dde2c6bc3d36_1024x267.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5daab13-56c5-46f2-bc6f-dde2c6bc3d36_1024x267.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">US stock investing startup landscape </figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>How does it work and are these entities regulated?</strong> Investors can start investing in global stocks in two ways, i.e. mutual funds or brokers that provide exposure to global stocks. In India, there are <a href="https://www.etmoney.com/mutual-funds/equity/international/50">several mutual fund schemes</a> that offer exposure to various global markets. One can directly start investing through them. A lot of them are also well diversified. The second method is using apps from fintech startups like INDMoney, Vested, Groww and others. These companies are not regulated because there is no such specific regulation. These startups have to ensure their users comply with outward remittance regulations. For individuals, RBI allows up to $250,000 (INR 1.85 Cr) under the liberalised remittance scheme (LRS). These startups partner with DriveWealth or Viewtrade Securities - US Brokers, in the US for clearing and settlement of the trades. If one invests through the Mutual Fund route, they own units in those fund schemes, whereas if they invest through these startups, they get direct ownership of the stocks. The National Stock Exchange is also working on introducing US stock investing via GIFT City (<a href="https://fintechinside.substack.com/p/fintech-inside-33-15th-aug-2021-finfluencers">read more in the August edition</a>)</p><p><strong>How much does this cost?</strong> This is where global stock investing models break down. Cost structures in India are brutal, especially if investing directly via apps. The apps themselves are free to invest, but <a href="https://www.winvesta.in/blog/things-to-keep-in-mind-before-investing-in-the-us-stock-market/">everything else is expensive</a>. First, one has to transfer money from the Indian bank account to their US brokerage account. In this leg itself, banks can charge up to 5% of the amount being transferred before the FX conversion. There's a recently introduced <a href="https://vested.co.in/blog/how-to-invest-in-the-us-stock-market-from-india/">Tax Collected at Source (TCS)</a> of 5% for remittances of greater than INR 7 lacs ($9,500) in a fiscal year. Then, when selling foreign stocks, the transaction falls under foreign capital gains, which means stocks sold within 24 months of purchase is considered as short term capital gains and tax as per your income tax bracket. Long term capital gains are taxed at 20%. Dividends are taxed in US at 25% before distribution. Effectively, direct global stock investing makes sense only for larger amounts and if held longer. It sort of makes sense for <a href="https://twitter.com/ashishkashyap/status/1430593514979532804?s=20">INDMoney to launch a embedded US stock investing bank account with 0 fees.</a></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22fb0659-09fa-447f-87ff-5bf1d7148564_1024x430.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22fb0659-09fa-447f-87ff-5bf1d7148564_1024x430.png" width="1024" height="430" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/22fb0659-09fa-447f-87ff-5bf1d7148564_1024x430.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:430,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:101324,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22fb0659-09fa-447f-87ff-5bf1d7148564_1024x430.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22fb0659-09fa-447f-87ff-5bf1d7148564_1024x430.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22fb0659-09fa-447f-87ff-5bf1d7148564_1024x430.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22fb0659-09fa-447f-87ff-5bf1d7148564_1024x430.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Global stock investing is a lucrative opportunity for Indian startups, especially because of how globalised our economies have become. Growing aspirations and rising urbanisation is a huge growth driver. There are several more features that can be built on top of global stock investing. Features like social trading, smallcase-like indexes, rewards, global deposit accounts and many more that enhance the user experience. The challenges for startups in this sector include regulations, low barriers to entry, limited TAM and of course those mentioned above.</p><p><strong>Should one own stock of companies whose product they use?</strong> There could be infinite ways to evaluate whether to own the stock of a company - sure, consuming it could be one. But if someone doesn't understand how a business works, then it's probably not a good idea. Most importantly, it's important to understand the associated cost and tax structures.</p><p><em>Disclaimer: This post is purely intended for educational purposes.

Digital payments in offline mode might sound paradoxical but it's been a major focus for RBI. In its first regulatory sandbox i.e. <a href="https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=52217">Retail Payments</a>, RBI approved different offline payment experiments for example sound based payments, NFC offline payments, transit payments and more. India is still <a href="https://twitter.com/jainmayank_943/status/1445552644144070664?s=20">majority cash economy</a>. Which is also why enhancing the upper limit of IMPS (a payment rail on which UPI was built, but not anymore) transactions makes sense. SMB's also largely prefer cash, because of its inherent liquidity but also because of the regulatory limit. Enhancing IMPS limit enables large ticket transactions to settle instantaneously.</p><p>The proposal to geo tag India's payments acceptance network is big. RBI today tracks the active POS devices and ATM machines. Payment cos. I'm sure geo tag all payment acceptance points i.e. QR merchants, POS, Soft POS and others. Centralising this data will bring a bunch of benefits. Most important of all these announcements, to me, is the announcement of the new theme and on tap sandbox applications. The new theme is hugely important. <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/rbi-brings-in-central-fraud-registry-a-likely-major-gamechanger-for-banking/articleshow/70567463.cms?from=mdr">In 2019</a>, RBI launched a <a href="https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10477#1">Central Fraud Registry (CFR)</a> but that's limited to only Banks and specific regulated entities and the <a href="https://dbie.rbi.org.in/CFR/">public facing website throws up an error</a>. Few Indian companies or startups are even building solutions for financial frauds. It's typically built in house or integrated from international providers. Lot's to look forward to.</p><p><strong>2&#65039;&#8419; Crypto India is becoming mainstream (a round up)</strong></p><p><strong>CoinSwitch</strong>, an Indian cryptocurrency exchange, <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/market/india-gets-its-second-crypto-unicorn-coinswitch-kuber-valued-at-1-9b-with-260m-funding/2345008/">raised</a> $260mm in funding at $1.9bn valuation. The company, launched in India 15 months ago, announced hitting 10mm registered users to &#8220;become India&#8217;s largest crypto platform". Of this user base, 7mm are active users with a monthly transaction volume of $2bn. In April this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/tiger-global-backs-indian-crypto-startup-coinswitch-kuber-at-over-500m-valuation/">the company raised</a> a funding round at $500mm valuation. <strong>CoinDCX</strong>, another cryptocurrency exchange, raised funding in August, 2021 at $1.1bn valuation. <strong>Groww</strong>'s cofounder said it <a href="https://www.businesstoday.in/markets/market-perspective/story/exclusive-groww-may-foray-into-cryptocurrency-trading-post-clarity-on-regulatory-issues-says-ceo-lalit-keshre-308672-2021-10-06">will launch</a> cryptocurrency trading post getting clarity from regulators. <strong>Stader Labs</strong>, a crypto staking management startup, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/funding/stader-labs-raises-4-million-in-round-led-by-pantera-capital/articleshow/86841107.cms">raised</a> $4mm. All this is happening at a time when India's crypto market <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/india-s-crypto-market-grew-641-over-past-year-chainalysis-says">grew</a> 641% over the past 12 months.</p><p><em>Some additional stats on CoinSwitch</em>: Over 55% of CoinSwitch users come from Tier-II and Tier-III cities. Average crypto investment is around $121 per month per user: $157 in Tier-I cities, $82 in Tier-II, and $47 in Tier-III cities</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>: The past 12 months have been roller coaster for cryptocurrency - the peaks in Dec-21, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/bitcoin-price-crash-latest-crypto-2021-b1836265.html">lows in Apr-21</a> and now back to $55K. 2021 has been a blockbuster year for the entire Indian financial market - stocks, mutual funds, digital gold and even crypto exchanges. All platforms have seen record user sign ups, largely driven by user growth beyond Tier-1 cities. Growth of crypto exchanges has puzzled me the most though - nothing seems to have systemically changed (I may be wrong) to indicate that this growth is here to stay. Methinks, when the music stops, crypto exchanges will be the first ones to see withdrawals. I hope I'm wrong. Groww looking to launch crypto as an exchange and CoinSwitch looking to get into stock brokerage talks of a broader trend. Guess we'll have to wait for SEBI to take a stab at regulating crypto exchanges or providing clarity on brokers launching crypto exchanges.</p><p>An interesting thing that came out of the funding news this week is the number of registered users:<br>- CoinSwitch (crypto exchange): 10mm<br>- WazirX (crypto exchange) : 8.5mm<br>- Zerodha (stock broker): 7mm <br>- UpStox (stock broker): 4mm (Jul, 21) <br>- Entire mutual fund industry: 23.9mm (Jun, 21)</p><p>Crypto exchanges have grown much larger (in terms of registered users) than investors participating in India's stock markets. This despite <a href="https://www.livemint.com/market/cryptocurrency/crypto-exchanges-ops-hit-as-lenders-sever-ties-11621282141905.html">Indian banks momentarily blocking</a> rupee deposits for new users in May/Jun-21 and an informal note by RBI. With <a href="https://fintechinside.substack.com/p/thirtynine">GDP per capita and employment rates lower than previous years</a> and inflation at 5-6%, Indians are probably looking for any avenue to make quick returns.

Launching a centralised data sharing platform to curb financial fraud has massive benefits. Hong Kong's central bank also indicated that it's thinking of central bank digital currencies (CBDC) i.e. e-HKD. Per the technical overview, Hong Kong's central bank has been developing a wholesale CBDC since 2017 largely for cross border trader. Now it is researching what a retail CBDC will look like. Definitely take time out to read the 50 page overview.</p><p>Ajaib, an Indonesian stock broking startup, raised a huge sum of $153mm (after raising $65mm in Mar, 21) to double down on Indonesia's investment market. Out of the 2.7mm stock investors in Indonesia, Ajaib claims to have 1mm (30% market share). Indonesia has a population of 274mm. With this funding, Ajaib will have to focus on expanding the market through education as financial literacy in the capital markets is only 4.9%. Bank Jago, Indonesia's first digital-only universal bank, raised an undisclosed amount from Ribbit Capital. Ribbit is the fintech focused US VC fund and more importantly fintech solution partner to Walmart. The Walmart Ribbit partnership announcement was vague at best but there's still no indication of what it will look like. Ribbit has been investing heavily in India and more aggressively in SEA. Walmart owns PhonePe in India, but I wonder if there are plans for SEA just yet.</p><div><hr></div><blockquote><p><strong>Looking for the news digest? </strong>Read all the week&#8217;s fintech news and updates in India and SEA over at <a href="http://asia.thisweekinfintech.com">This Week in Fintech - India and SEA Edition</a>.

It's possible I could be wrong in areas here. Take the piece below with a (massive) pinch of salt. If you already know about GDP, you can give this post a pass.</em></p><p>Recently someone asked me what I thought India's GDP per capita would be in 2030. Wanting to sound smart and with some hesitation, I said USD 5,000! Little did I know, USD 5,000 GDP per Capita effectively meant a total GDP of $6.8tn without accounting for population growth. I was clearly throwing darts in the dark. I've always been intrigued by the GDP metric - what it meant, what constitutes it, what can affects it etc. but I never bothered to truly understand it. This conversation pushed me to go deep. Thankfully, on 15th Sep, 2021, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) released its <a href="https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/AnnualPublications.aspx?head=Handbook%20of%20Statistics%20on%20Indian%20Economy">Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy</a> with tons of data on the Indian economy and its performance. A lot of this post is an attempt to understand GDP using that data. Down the rabbit hole we go!</p><p><strong>This is a fintech newsletter, why are we talking about macro economics?</strong> As they say, you can optimise what you measure. GDP per capita is that one metric which captures consumption and spending habits in the country. As a reader of this newsletter you are most likely attempting to disrupt finance. It's important to know GDP per capita to understand employment, productivity, spending, wealth growth and more. These factors influence consumer behaviour toward finances, savings, investments, expenditure and more.</p><p>As per these latest numbers by RBI, India is home to 1.34bn people, growing 1.1% YoY. The country's GDP per Capita is $~1,969 in FY21 (<a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2021/may/20/bangladesh-beats-india-in-per-capita-income-2304942.html">Bangladesh - $2,227</a>, <a href="https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/pakistan/gdp-per-capita">Pakistan - $1,221</a>), a number that's been showing slowing growth since FY2017. We could have attributed this degrowth to Covid, but unfortunately, trends show otherwise. Moreover, employment in the country has also been decreasing. Only 42.1 mm Indians are employed in the public and organised private sectors.

GDP is basically the sum of all spends and investments within the border of a country. It accounts for consumer and private sector spending, government spending, investments and FDI in fixed assets in India and net exports. Different countries have different ways of calculating GDP. Methods include expenditures, production or incomes. GDP growth rate captures how fast or slow an economy is growing its spends. The first basic concept of GDP was invented at the end of the 18th century. The modern concept was developed by the American economist Simon Kuznets in 1934 and adopted as the main measure of a country's economy at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944. GDP does not account for sales of used goods, off market transactions, intermediate goods and more.</p><p>The GDP value captured the country's economic activity well, but it became difficult to compare countries - countries with higher population would technically have higher GDP. Thus GDP per capita i.e. GDP over population, was coined. It's a finer metric used to compare economic activities of different countries but gives a good indication of the per capita economic activity.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b7b97cf-cee3-421b-9393-e1bd8aae9f1a_1024x440.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b7b97cf-cee3-421b-9393-e1bd8aae9f1a_1024x440.png" width="1024" height="440" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1b7b97cf-cee3-421b-9393-e1bd8aae9f1a_1024x440.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:440,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;https://fintechinside.club/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image-1-1024x440.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="https://fintechinside.club/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image-1-1024x440.png" title="https://fintechinside.club/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image-1-1024x440.png" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b7b97cf-cee3-421b-9393-e1bd8aae9f1a_1024x440.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b7b97cf-cee3-421b-9393-e1bd8aae9f1a_1024x440.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b7b97cf-cee3-421b-9393-e1bd8aae9f1a_1024x440.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b7b97cf-cee3-421b-9393-e1bd8aae9f1a_1024x440.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>RBI calculates India's GDP in the same way as above (with some finer details) and <a href="https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/PublicationsView.aspx?id=20409">released the GDP components via the Handbook</a>.</p><ol><li><p>Consumer spending is captured as "Private Final Consumption Expenditure" and accounts for 60% of total GDP.

After all, GDP was formally accepted in a second world war environment. It obviously doesn't fully capture all the innovation of the internet era. For example, earlier the purchase of each music CD would be counted in GDP, now with Spotify and Gaana with just INR 100 ($1.35) a month you can get the entire world's music but dramatically reduces the GDP capture. Yes, we can argue that India's economy is still largely agrarian and not technology driven. However, GDP also <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriksherman/2019/07/07/the-problems-with-gdp-unemployment-rates-and-other-official-economic-measures/?sh=2975476521c9">only captures consumption</a>, not production or capacity.

The only long term way to enable people to spend is to employ them. Indians are woefully under-employed. <a href="https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/PublicationsView.aspx?id=20419">Public sector is clearly not adding any jobs</a>. The burden therefore lies on the private sector. Technology, to some extent, might not allow businesses to create the number of jobs it did in the past. India's entire startup ecosystem might not hire more than a few hundred thousand people. Per India's <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/what-economic-survey-2020-21-says-about-indias-startup-ecosystem/articleshow/80586774.cms?from=mdr">Economic Survey Report for 2020</a> reported that 39,000 startups employed 470K people. We'll probably need dramatically more startups in India or bring about serious SMB reforms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Increase women participation in the workforce</strong>: This is potentially the easiest but also the toughest to solve for. <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/02/20/only-7-of-urban-indian-women-have-paid-jobs">7% female labour force participation rate</a> should be outright unacceptable. I say easy because half the population is women and majority are skilled. I say it's tough because there's the issue of male oriented HR policies and cultural issues. Companies don't hire women for several reasons <a href="https://fintechinside.substack.com/p/fintech-inside-28-10th-july-2021">mentioned in a previous edition</a>. Cultural issues of families not allowing "women of the house" to work or even educated women quitting work to "take care of the family" most times out of force. This is changing but very slowly. Companies like Xiaomi, Ola, Bounce have all-women employees at their factories in India. More of this!</p></li><li><p><strong>Increase business investment</strong>: Private sector spending and bringing in more investment needs to grow in a massive way. Indian startups are raising tons of capital (<a href="https://entrackr.com/2021/10/indian-startups-raised-funding-3-4-bn-september/">$3.4bn in Sept, 2021 alone!</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/27/indian-startups-raised-9-3-billion-in-2020/">$9.3bn in 2020</a>) but very little of that is going towards investment in fixed assets or manufacturing. India lost it's biggest opportunity to grow manufacturing through it's "Make in India" program. How many states do you see compete with incentives to bring investments to their states? Even when Tesla decided to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/15/tesla-to-set-up-electric-car-manufacturing-unit-in-southern-india.html">set up a manufacturing unit in India</a>, it seemed like Karnataka didn't have to make any effort. Chinese provinces (states) are known to offer tax breaks, labour incentives and payments and many more - all to attract investments and manufacturing with the result of direct growth in employment. We all long for this mindset from Indian politicians.</p></li></ol><p>Given the above, do I still think India's GDP per Capita will reach $5,000? Obviously not. It's highly speculative to predict any number here - especially with my level of knowledge. Though, I'm hopeful. There's a lot working in India's favour - young population, smartphone penetration, mobile data penetration and more. &#8220;<em>Most people overestimate what they can achieve in a year and underestimate what they can achieve in ten years</em>.&#8221;</p><p><strong>1-min Anonymous Feedback:</strong> Your feedback helps me improve this newsletter.

This is a first for the RBI referring to regulations for fintech startups and big tech companies. The deputy governor also said that fintech startups should be regulated based on activity rather than entity-based. This is an interesting thought for regulations (not sure if any other country regulates companies this way) and might have been a random statement. While vague, it could signal more regulations for fintech startups, even ones that are not licensed.</p><p>SEBI was busy as well this week where it approved a few things at its board meeting. First - Higher net worth cap for promoters of public companies to have differential voting rights. This helps promoters/founders (who typically own &lt;10%) of startups that are listing to have more voting rights. This is a global concept and its great that it's being iterated for India, especially given the spate of startups listing this quarter. Second - the gold spot exchange framework. This is another interesting development. "Gold Spot Exchange" has been offered, unregulated, by literally two companies in India i.e. SafeGold (a startup) and MMTC PAMP (a precious metal refiner). With the new framework, these two companies' offerings will become legit. But what's new is that traditional stock exchanges can also begin offering the same investment product. Another interesting thing is that SEBI has mandated "fungibility", meaning investors can switch their investments to any exchange at any time. Will this be SEBI's way of testing out regulations for a crypto exchange license in the near future?</p><p><strong>2&#65039;&#8419; US Stocks as rewards for credit card spend</strong></p><p>I<strong>NDMoney</strong>, an Indian wealth management startup, <a href="https://twitter.com/ashishkashyap/status/1441050862168666122">launched</a> US stocks as rewards for card spends. Users will have to connect their Gmail ID with INDMoney for INDMoney to automatically track card statements. Based on card spends, INDMoney will reward the user with US stocks. It seems the US stock rewarding will also be done for credit score improvement and other "<a href="https://twitter.com/ashishdeokar/status/1443784035625439251?s=20">good financial behaviour</a>". Rewards will be typically 1-1.5% of credit card spends.</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>: I like the thought behind the product - lowers the barrier to own US stocks. INDMoney has likely seen a ton of traction for its US stock investing product and seems like it's doubling down on this. First it launched a zero fee, integrated bank account for US stock investing, now it launched a better rewards program (earlier INDCoins program is scrapped it seems). INDMoney is clearly playing the "own stocks of products you use" card here.</p><p>A lot of the details here are unclear - will you be allocated stock of any US company or only those of which spends are detected? will rewards be given only when card statements are generated? how will rewards be given when there's no real transfer of money happening? what happens to ownership of the rewarded stocks if the user doesn't want delivery/forgets about it? It's early days for US stock investing for Indians and Indian startups and all these details will be ironed out over time.</p><p><strong>3&#65039;&#8419; SEA Round up</strong></p><p><strong>Vietnam</strong>'s government <a href="https://www.globalgovernmentfintech.com/vietnam-progresses-fintech-sandbox/">approved</a> a resolution to create a financial regulatory sandbox. Singapore <a href="https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/38906/singapore-and-malaysia-link-faster-payment-systems?utm_medium=rssfinextra&amp;utm_source=finextrafeed">announced</a> plans to integrate its instant bank transfer platform PayNow with Malaysia's DuitNow. <strong>BSP</strong>, Philippine central bank, <a href="https://mb.com.ph/2021/09/26/bsp-renews-plea-to-pass-anti-cybercrime-law-now/">urged policy makers</a> to immediately pass an anti-cybercrime law to protect financial consumers. <strong>Central Bank of Malaysia</strong> <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20210924PD209.html">said it will issue</a> digital banking licenses to five entities (out of 29 applicants) in early 2022. <strong>Aspire</strong>, a South East Asian SMB finance platform, <a href="https://e27.co/aspire-lands-us158m-series-b-to-scale-its-all-in-one-finance-os-for-smes-across-sea-20210927/">raised </a>$158mm. <strong>Ascend</strong>, a Thai payments firm, <a href="https://fintechnews.sg/55774/thailand/payments-firm-ascend-money-becomes-thailands-first-fintech-unicorn/">raised</a> $150mm at a $1bn valuation (Thailand's first fintech unicorn).</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>: Fintech investment in SEA is on fire: Aspire raising $158mm and Ascend raising $150mm are huge! Aspire has been crushing it at SMB banking in SEA. Ascend became Thailand's first fintech unicorn. Such large fund raises are not very common yet (especially outside Indonesia) and this could signal an inflection point in SEA.</p><p>After announcing an integration with India's UPI, MAS in Singapore is integrating with Malaysia's DuitNow - an instant bank transfer system. Singapore is quickly creating a regional, cross border payments infrastructure for itself and the region. Philippines seems to be following Singapore's lead in combating cyber crime. Last week Singapore said it would launch licenses for cyber security firms, this week Philippine central bank urged law makers to pass an anti-cyber crime law. It's going to be interesting to watch these regulatory moves and how they impact growth of fintech.</p><div><hr></div><blockquote><p><strong>Looking for the news digest? </strong>Read all the week&#8217;s fintech news and updates in India and SEA over at <a href="http://asia.thisweekinfintech.com">This Week in Fintech - India and SEA Edition</a>.
