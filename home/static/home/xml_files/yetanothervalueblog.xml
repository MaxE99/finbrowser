In particular, I thought<a href="https://yetanothervalueblog.substack.com/p/what-am-i-missing-with-cyclicals?s=w"> cyclicals </a>and<a href="https://yetanothervalueblog.substack.com/p/what-am-i-missing-with-retailers?s=w"> sporting goods stores</a> looked way too cheap. The high level thesis was these companies were producing record results and buying back shares pretty aggressively, yet the market refused to give them credit for the results and they traded for insanely low multiples.</p><p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about those posts recently. I&#8217;m hearing from lots of friends about companies and set ups that seem no brainers. A few hypothetical examples (that are very similar to current pitches I&#8217;ve heard):</p><ul><li><p>Across the board, commodity companies still look cheap. Six months ago, oil and gas stock prices probably implied a curve ~$10 below where the market was pricing (I.e. if the futures curve was ~$70/barrel, most energy stock prices implied ~$60/barrel). Today, many of those oil companies have seen nice appreciation, but the appreciation far undershoots the current oil curve (I.e. the stock now implies ~$65 oil, but the oil curve&#8217;s moved to $80).</p></li><li><p>I used energy stocks above, but you could use the same logic for just about anything touching the current commodity boom. Fertilizers, refiners, etc. All of them are minting money right now, and they&#8217;ll print a huge piece of their market cap at the current curve. At current prices, the stock market is basically implying no terminal value for these businesses. </p><ul><li><p>Another way to frame the commodity / energy opportunity: There&#8217;s a big divergence between the futures curve and the price implied by the stock market; there should be opportunities there.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>I&#8217;ve mentioned th<a href="https://yetanothervalueblog.substack.com/p/mgi-and-the-opportunity-set-in-rumored?s=w">e &#8220;rumored deal&#8221; set previously,</a> but it seems there remains huge opportunity there. Stocks with insider buying and offers from financial buyers continue to trade at huge discounts to the offer price until a deal is officially locked down.</p></li></ul><p>Honestly, it&#8217;s got me a little nervous. In investing, deep insights that make alpha are rare. A lot of times, you get paid for assuming risks that you don&#8217;t realize you&#8217;re taking. Investors in Lehman Brothers made huge returns for years&#8230;. until it all got taken away because it turned out they were taking on huge illiquidity and accounting risks. Often, you can make a fortune in commodity plays because you&#8217;re implicitly making a bet on the commodity curve, and if the curve goes up you make money but if it moves against you you get demolished.</p><p>I keep looking at these situations and wondering what I&#8217;m missing. On the commodity plays, you&#8217;re buying with built in &#8220;if the curve moves down 20%, the stock is still undervalued&#8221; protection. Many of these &#8220;rumored deal&#8221; stocks look incredibly cheap even if their deals fall through (or never get finalized), and they often have insanely strong balance sheets that would allow them to aggressively return capital if they decide to remain public.</p><p>The market is a very competitive place. There&#8217;s generally not easy alpha laying around, and if there is &#8220;easy alpha&#8221; it&#8217;s generally because there&#8217;s lots of risks you&#8217;re missing&#8230;.. but there&#8217;s lots of situations I see at that look &#8220;easy&#8221;, and that&#8217;s got me worried.</p><p>What am I missing?</p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tegus sponsored deep dive #2: Regeneron]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is the second entry in my deep dives sponsored by Tegus series.

The goal of these are simple: every month,<a href="https://www.tegus.co/value"> Tegus</a> is going to give me a few expert interviews and I&#8217;m going to use those to dive into an investing topic. Some months, it could just be a dive into a specific company; other months, it might be a dive into an industry. You can find the <a href="https://yetanothervalueblog.substack.com/p/tegus-sponsored-deep-dive-1-cable?s=w">first deep dive into the risks to the cable industry here.</a></p><p>I&#8217;m hoping this series is a screaming success, with readers and myself learning a ton from the interviews and <a href="https://www.tegus.com/trial/value">Tegus getting lots of publicity</a> for their product (which I love and is table stakes for fundamental investors) and that I&#8217;ll be able to turn these into a regular monthly recurring feature forever. Of course, that involves everyone feeling like they&#8217;re getting value from the series, so please <a href="https://www.tegus.com/trial/value">check out Tegus</a> if you&#8217;re a fundamental investor and haven&#8217;t done so already (again, it&#8217;s pretty much table stakes for investors at this point).</p><p>My first deep dive was into the sector I was most familiar with (cable). For my second post, I figured I&#8217;d do a complete 180 and choose a company I had almost no familiarity with, Regeneron. I&#8217;ll talk about why in a second, but before I do let me highlight the three Regeneron calls I did (note: for the next year, these links should give you access to the calls even without a Tegus sub, so it&#8217;s a great trial even if you&#8217;re not a sub!):</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://app.tegus.co/guest/view/6SDHoJ2BVwxYRFKwQ2kEbNzPd4fiPFLAtNYy7cbApECpp5NSV9awTRj2bjr7">Former Executive at Regeneron</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://app.tegus.co/guest/view/uzaGBipzpRnSP8G6AfxZ9xbNsfq3sAkssUhmP5muLHcBxJ33RNL95Q9JUJeY">Former Employee at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc</a> </p><ul><li><p>Note: all of the calls were good, but I think this call was particularly interesting.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://app.tegus.co/guest/view/RUW4b1vtksVBZhTWNkjtZj7VChrZczRCc6oc5syBmheQrqzAPizxRXx9RmXd">Former Executive at Regeneron</a></p></li></ul><p>So why choose Regeneron? Well, I had almost no knowledge of the company, but I&#8217;ve had it on my &#8220;to research&#8221; list for a long time. Three things really got it there:</p><ul><li><p>My <a href="https://twitter.com/ElliotTurn">buddy Elliot Turner</a> has always been pushing me to look at it, telling me it was a great company with a huge moat trading at a reasonable to downright cheap price.</p></li><li><p>John Hempton / Bronte <a href="http://files.brontecapital.com/amalthea/Amalthea_Letter_202106.pdf">Capital&#8217;s Q2&#8217;21 letter described REGN</a> as the rare growth stock that &#8220;comes into a price range we consider worthy of a full-sized position.&#8221;</p></li><li><p>The (sadly retired) GOAT of substacks, Nongaap<a href="https://nongaap.substack.com/p/premium-cocktails-and-compensation">, covered a very bullish RSU grant REGN gave to their top execs last year</a>.</p></li></ul><p>That&#8217;s an insanely interesting combination: multiple investors pitching it as a great company with a huge moat at a reasonable price (or, in some cases, unreasonably cheap; even after a nice run, REGN today trades for &lt;$700/share. 2021 EPS was ~$72/share, so you&#8217;re paying &lt;10x EPS for a company with a unique moat and assets as well as a huge net cash balance. Admittedly, 2021 is driven by a COVID bump, but how often do growth pharma companies with unique assets trade at &lt;10x EPS? My friends a<a href="https://daloopa.com/models/regn?utm_source=YAVB-Partnership&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=REGN&amp;utm_term=April2022">t Daloopa have a full REGN model available free</a> if you&#8217;re interested in diving further into their financials), plus with a governance expert pointing out management&#8217;s actions suggested they thought the stock was screamingly cheap / were prepping for long term price appreciation. </p><p>So I&#8217;ve always meant to dive into REGN, but it&#8217;s been a daunting task. Diving into anything pharma related is much, much more complex than diving into, say, a media company or a cable company. If you&#8217;ve studied one cable company, you&#8217;ve got a great base of knowledge for diving into any telecom worldwide. Obviously, there are market by market differences, but if you&#8217;ve looked at one you&#8217;ll understand the basic trends, what to look for, etc. for all of the other cable companies and can get up to speed reasonably quickly. The same is not true of pharma or biotech; each company and asset base is generally completely unique and needs to be diligenced separately. The proper way to dive into a pharma company is generally to take every single drug or potential drug of meaningful size they have and do a deep dive diligence into each drug (analyzing the market and potential competitors, patent portfolio, peaks sales range, etc.); doing so can take an enormous amount of time.</p><p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve always meant to dive into REGN, but life kept getting in the way! So when<a href="https://yetanothervalueblog.substack.com/p/announcing-deep-dives-sponsored-by"> I announced deep dives sponsored by Tegus</a>, I had REGN at the top of the list for companies I wanted to look into. It&#8217;s a fascinating company, and I thought it was a perfect fit to show how some expert calls can help you get up to speed on a company.</p><p>And, after diving into REGN, I can see why so many investors are interested in them. An anecdote might help show why: I was actually hoping to have this post up a few weeks ago, but Tegus and I ran into some challenges scheduling calls. For compliance purposes, Tegus generally doesn&#8217;t allow for experts who are participating in active clinical trials to do expert calls. Tegus and I had roughly ten false starts where we identified a really perfect expert to interview and then Tegus came back and had to cancel the call because the expert was involved in a drug trial. That&#8217;s exceedingly rare; in fact, my account manager told me that she&#8217;d never had a company where so many experts got disqualified for working on clinical trials. So, while it made scheduling calls a bit frustrating, I think the fact that so many experts were involved in clinical trials in some form speaks to how unique Regneron is.</p><p>So that&#8217;s why I was so interested in Regeneron. Let&#8217;s dive into the company.</p><p>Regeneron is a &#8220;fully integrated&#8221; biotech. At this point, they&#8217;re probably best known for their COVID antibody treatment (which likely saved <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/health/trump-antibody-treatment.html">Trump&#8217;s life when he was President and caught COVID</a>). How they made <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90622914/how-regeneron-developed-its-covid-19-fighting-antibody-cocktail">that COVID cocktail in record breaking time is pretty fascinating</a>; it came in part from work they did developing Ebola and MERS treatments, and to develop it in just 10 months would have been absolutely unthinkable a decade ago.</p><p>While REGN certainly enjoyed a boom from the COVID cocktail (their COVID antibodies generated ~$7.5B in sales in 2021, more than the entire company&#8217;s revenue of ~$6.6B in 2019!), REGN is much more than the COVID cocktail. They have two other blockbuster drugs: <a href="https://eylea.us">Eylea</a>, a biologic eye injection that did ~$9.4B in sales in 2021, and <a href="https://www.dupixent.com">Dupixent</a>, a biologic injection that treats a host of issues (including asthma and eczema) that did $6.2B in sales in 2021. REGN also has a massive pipeline of clinical stage drugs that could treat a wide variety of diseases.</p><p>But it&#8217;s not the specific molecules that REGN owns / produces that makes them so interesting. The things that really set REGN apart are the VelociSuite and the Regeneron Genetics Center. These are unique assets that let REGN develop new drugs significantly faster and cheaper than peers (<a href="https://www.bamsec.com/transcripts/14898436">quote below from this conference</a>):</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89170358-c72b-4b4f-8234-00debb3c4c60_932x502.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89170358-c72b-4b4f-8234-00debb3c4c60_932x502.png" width="932" height="502" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/89170358-c72b-4b4f-8234-00debb3c4c60_932x502.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:502,&quot;width&quot;:932,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:171381,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89170358-c72b-4b4f-8234-00debb3c4c60_932x502.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89170358-c72b-4b4f-8234-00debb3c4c60_932x502.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89170358-c72b-4b4f-8234-00debb3c4c60_932x502.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89170358-c72b-4b4f-8234-00debb3c4c60_932x502.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><blockquote><p>The important principles to take away here are these approaches can now enable us to do trials with larger effect sizes, think about 65% versus 15%. We can do them faster. These can be precision trials that are less expensive and we get signal, and readouts a lot earlier. So absolutely, this can transform the way we do development and can help us with very difficult fields that haven't been broken in terms of NASH and other difficult fields.</p></blockquote><p>The pharma field is dominated by giants. In 2021, REGN did ~$16B in sales and spent $3B in R&amp;D. Those were, by far, records for REGN (in 2019, they did ~$6.6B in sales and spent $2.5B in R&amp;D), and they&#8217;re certainly big numbers&#8230;. but they pale in comparison to the giants of the industry. Pfizer, for example, did $81B in revenue in 2021, and spent almost $14B on R&amp;D, so their R&amp;D budget roughly matches REGN&#8217;s annual revenue. </p><p>It&#8217;s not lost on anyone that drug development is insanely expensive and risky. So my main purpose of this dive was to learn more about VelociSuite and the Regeneron Genetics Center: what are they, how are they so effective at reducing cost and risks in trials, and if they&#8217;re so great why can&#8217;t industry giants with R&amp;D budgets multiples larger than REGN recreate them?</p><p>Let&#8217;s start with VelociSuite. This suite includes a whole host of technologies (<em>VelocImmune&#174;</em>,<em> VelociGene&#174;</em>,<em> VelociMouse</em>&#174;,<em> VelociMab&#174;</em>, <em>Veloci-Bi</em>&#174;, <em>VelociT</em>&#174;,<em> VelociHum</em>&#174;) and was the core asset behind REGN&#8217;s founding. As<a href="https://www.bamsec.com/transcripts/14898436"> one of the founders put it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>So to remind you about our history at Regeneron, we founded and built this company on the dream of the power of mouse genetics, and we invented the most powerful technology to engineer the mouse genome, which we called VelociGene. Even in the age of CRISPR, VelociGene remains the most powerful and rapid genome engineering technology in the world. VelociGene allowed us to test genetic variation in the mouse, that is knocking out of genes or humanization and insertion of modified human genes so as to test and validate potential drug targets. And because of this VelociGene capability, we were able to do this testing at an incredible scale, hundreds of potential drug targets a year. This gave us enormous confidence in the targets we were pursuing and helped explain the remarkably high success rates that we ultimately had in the clinic.</p><p>But we also recognize that we needed a new turnkey ways of making new medicines based on these genetic insights that we were getting from the mouse studies. For example, one turnkey approach that we developed was we exploited VelociGene to make our VelocImmune mouse. It was the largest genome engineering project in history, where we precisely replaced over 6 megabases of mouse immune genes with their human genetic counterparts to create the most powerful way of making and selecting for the best fully human antibodies rapidly and in a manufacturing-ready way. So combining mouse genetics, high-throughput mouse genetics, with these turnkey therapeutics approaches allowed us to deliver many important medicines from our laboratories, from EYLEA to DUPIXENT to PRALUENT to the highly effective antibody cocktail treatments for epidemics, initially Ebola and, most recently, COVID-19.</p></blockquote><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5f36249-6ab3-4146-805c-d5408394bdab_729x404.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5f36249-6ab3-4146-805c-d5408394bdab_729x404.png" width="729" height="404" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f5f36249-6ab3-4146-805c-d5408394bdab_729x404.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:404,&quot;width&quot;:729,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:162127,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5f36249-6ab3-4146-805c-d5408394bdab_729x404.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5f36249-6ab3-4146-805c-d5408394bdab_729x404.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5f36249-6ab3-4146-805c-d5408394bdab_729x404.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5f36249-6ab3-4146-805c-d5408394bdab_729x404.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>So basically the VelociSuite lets REGN use mice to rapidly come up with and test therapeutics. That&#8217;s a huge, huge edge for REGN; <a href="https://app.tegus.co/app/transcript/28044">as one expert put it:</a></p><blockquote><p>What is the technology that Regeneron has that other people cannot follow it? Well, this is the main thing I think Regeneron came up with was the VelociSuite. I mean, basically, whatever infections you are thinking of, since Regeneron is an antibody-based company, they were looking for antibodies. And for the antibodies to happen, what is going to happen is, you have to have everything done in a mouse. And again, you have to humanize the antibodies before you can do a clinical trial and get into a human.</p><p>Well, Regeneron kind of did it like a fast forward kind of thing, and they already started with the mouse, which is already like a humanized mouse. And for that, they went into the mouse basically and changed the genetic mouse into a human mouse. And I think that gave a big fast forward kind of thing, which is like very difficult. And especially while working in Infectious Disease, I was working with the Staph virus at times.</p><p>And as you know, I mean the Staph bacteria, it is really, really bad. And so what we got to do is, with the Staph, we used to get animals from the VelociGene, which have already been humanized. So then when I do all my experiments, I would get antibodies, which are already humanized and I can go ahead and go with the trial. And I think that gave Regeneron biggest advantage over other people.</p></blockquote><p>In case getting mice to develop human antibodies sounds simple, the expert confirmed that it is, in fact, not:</p><blockquote><p>Mouse genes are very different from humans. And so they are very close, not that much of a difference. But if you change the mouse cell into a human, that makes a big difference. And from what they do is, instead of breeding out the mice, they don't breed out the mice. What they do is, they take the cell and they genetically modify it. So you would take a cell in a Petri dish and modify it. And then you would put it back into a mice to become like a humanized mice.</p><p>And from then on, when the breeding starts, that is what the breeding will happen and you already have a humanized mice. So if you take it into a different kind of a company, it will take you years to come up with mice like this. And especially, you're talking about like Jackson and all the other companies that already breeds mice, they take at least nine months, while Regeneron would be like very fast, probably within a month.</p></blockquote><p>I&#8217;m going to quote a full exchange between me and the expert, because I thought it did such a nice job of illustrating how different &#8220;humanized&#8221; mice are and why getting them humanized can accelerate development so much:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Tegus Client</strong></p><p>Got you. And this might be very silly. But I am not a virologist, but I would think if I had a mouse in my apartment or something and I had COVID, I couldn't pass COVID on to it, right?</p><p><strong>Former Employee at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</strong></p><p>No, exactly. There's no way.</p><p><strong>Tegus Client</strong></p><p>If you took one of these humanized mice, and I'm just curious on this. If you took one of these humanized mice and put it in my apartment, could I pass COVID on it? Like, are we basically just talking it's so close to humans?</p><p><strong>Former Employee at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</strong></p><p>Exactly. Totally, very close to humans. And that makes it such a big difference. And then later on, I'm just going to give you a little bit more details. What's interesting is, now when you look at the different, like what is the actual COVID virus doing? Can I knock-in and knockout? I'm sure you've heard about like knock-in mice and knockout mices, where they take out the gene and take it off and put it back on. With that technology, with VelociGene, it's so easy for them to do it. They just take off one gene and make sure, okay, if that gene has any capability of making this infection happen or not?</p><p>So that is what a knock-in and knockout gene happens, and that is very important for any of us to do any kind of study. We just want to know, especially in an antibody kind of department, it's like we want to know what are the different antibodies, what do they do? So if I knock-in a gene and knockout a gene and then give you the animal and then you're like doing studies with them, you will immediately see the effect that this is what the difference is.</p><p><strong>Tegus Client</strong></p><p>Got you. And just to define that a little further. And again, sorry to go so deep but is one of the advantages like you could have two mice. And obviously, with mice, I don't think there's huge inference of what you're doing with them. But you have two mice, one without a gene and one with a gene and then expose them both to <a href="https://app.tegus.co/app/database/search?companies=5901-COVID-19">COVID</a> or whatever it is you want and say, okay, this mouse caught it, this mouse didn&#8217;t, so now you can do it with 1,000 mice without the gene or something. It seems like if you don't have this gene? Or any thoughts on that?</p><p><strong>Former Employee at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</strong></p><p>Yes. That's what it is, yes. If you don't have the gene, then that's it, you cannot do it. And I think that is like the biggest, biggest difference that Regeneron has brought it in, which other companies still haven't found out. And that's the reason it takes such a long time for us to do anything. It takes such a long time for other companies to do any kind of studies because while they are waiting for this kind of mouse to arrive, which is like a knock-in and knockout, they're just waiting for other things to arrive before they can do any kind of experiments.</p></blockquote><p>Sorry for so much quote clipping, but I just thought that was such a great exchange and so illustrative of the advantages of Velocisuite I had to include it. Obviously the mice and stuff are cool, but if I had to sum it up the VelociSuite advantage is that it lets Regeneron target specific antibodies and genes and iterate on them much faster than other companies. Time is literally money when it comes to R&amp;D; every extra day of research is another day of paying expensive scientists, lab fees, etc., so VelociSuite gives Regeneron a time advantage that lets them try out more drugs / molecules / antibodies in less time and at lower cost than peers.</p><p>The other big REGN asset is the Regeneron Genetics Center (RGC). One of the founders<a href="https://www.bamsec.com/transcripts/14898436"> described the RGC as the human extension of the mouse side of VelociSuite</a></p><blockquote><p>And our vision was to take these same core principles and use them to build the genetic medicines capabilities of the future. We wanted to extend our ability to elucidate the functional implications of genetic variation in mice by creating a complementary capability to explore human genetic variation through mega-scale human sequencing, all linked to electronic medical records and to also incorporate the right toolkit of genetic and medicines to take advantage of these genetic insights that we were sure to gain from all of these efforts. Next slide.</p></blockquote><p>Again, I&#8217;ll turn to an expert to describe<a href="https://app.tegus.co/app/transcript/28044#highlighted-span--853920"> what the RGC is and why it&#8217;s such a big deal:</a></p><blockquote><p>Regeneron Genetics Center, that came about. And I think that made a huge difference. And I think that came in around like 2017, '18. I think that's when I had started working with them a little bit. And again, as I was telling you, I was working with the bacteria. So I was very interested.</p><p>I was working in such a way that some of the diseases that I was looking into, especially the bacterial disease. What I was looking into is like if you shut off one of the genes, it makes a huge difference. Like, to put it in basic words, it's like my blood and your blood is totally different. If I have something else in my blood, it will make the bacteria kill faster than yours.</p><p>So for that, I think that Regeneron Genetics Center made a huge, huge difference, for me to get into, because I would get into samples, which is like almost like 200 people, and that would give a huge difference. And I would take that and put it into a mouse strategy, how will I make my mouse model in such a way that I can address these kind of questions.</p></blockquote><p>The head of RGC dove into <a href="https://www.bamsec.com/transcripts/14898436">that history a little deeper at a conference:</a></p><blockquote><p>So we started this about 8 years ago, the RGC, a big human genetics initiative at Regeneron, again, based on the foundation and principles that George nicely highlighted and the power of genetics in mouse and human genetics and how it really changes the paradigm in drug discovery and development. Our industry is one that has been marked by a 90% failure rate. And as we look at all the targets of known medicines, approved medicines and experimental medicines, sadly, it's only about 5% to 10% of the genes in our human genome correspond to those drug targets. So clearly, we don't know enough about what our genes are doing, let alone which ones are the best levers for drug targets. I mean that's a really big deal and important differentiating point here. We have the largest database of gene variation linked to health and disease to start to make those connections, understandings and bring forward those drug targets.</p><p>To do this, you really have to have the right scale. You can't do this in a small fashion, and you can't do this without fully sequencing all of the genes. Our database now is approaching about 2 million individuals who've been sequenced. It's hard to say exactly. But from our friends at Illumina and elsewhere in the field, it's estimated that maybe 5 million people or so have been fully sequenced in the history of next-gen sequencing. So it really puts things into perspective what's happening here in Tarrytown. This does include the largest project to date in the world, which is a 500,000-person U.K. Biobank project. All of our projects are linked to very detailed phenotypic data, health record data, head-to-toe imaging data on lots of individuals, for example. This is an incredibly powerful resource for discovery and development.</p></blockquote><p>REGN&#8217;s edge here is big; the CSO noted that the scale and electronic linkage of this project dwarves everyone else:</p><blockquote><p>We have sequenced more than 2 million volunteers to date, representing almost half of all humans ever sequenced. But all of our sequence volunteers are linked to their electronic medical records, creating perhaps the world's largest and most valuable genetics-based big data, data set and which have already led to import new genetics-based drug targets and neurogenetics insights into clinical trial design.</p></blockquote><p>And that scale is important. There are really rare genetics mutations that let a small subset of humans fight specific diseases, and REGN&#8217;s huge scale lets them capture those mutations in their data set. As the <a href="https://www.bamsec.com/transcripts/14983273">head of RGC put it</a>, </p><blockquote><p>I love your verbiage there around really disease modifying and not a band aid. The first part of your story, this is one of our favorite examples of protective genetics. And we think about how genetics can inform drug discovery, development. And we simplified and we say, there are mutations like TTR or sickle cell that cause disease. And for rare populations like that, you create therapeutics that try to correct or restore the proper function. This is totally different. This is more down the path of something like PCSK9, where you find rare individuals out there that don't have disease, right? They have -- is almost, we like to have fun, we can call them, it's like superhuman powers, where they're protected from disease. And so once you find those things, you want to create therapies that mimic those powers. So we want to create therapies that will inhibit this target, and hopefully have the same types of beneficial effects on fatty liver disease. And yes, that in a nutshell, the thing we're really excited and hopeful for the potential of this target is that there is human data from human genetics, where you have a dramatic reduction in clinical outcomes of NASH. And we know we can pinpoint it to inflammation and fibrosis, which is really the hallmark of end stage disease of clinically meaningful disease, liver failure, liver cancer, transplants, death. And that's where this gene, this target is having its big punch in reducing those disease processes.</p></blockquote><p>So REGN has a massive lead in genetic sequencing&#8230; but they aren&#8217;t just sitting still with it. They&#8217;re using the lead to<a href="https://www.bamsec.com/transcripts/15079903"> partner with other companies and develop the &#8220;future of genetics medicine</a>s&#8221;</p><blockquote><p>We then took all of this from the Regeneron Genetics Center, and we strategically incorporated a series of selected partners with synergistic genetic capabilities such as Alnylam, that allowed us to develop an siRNA platform; or Intellia, delivering us a CRISPR-based gene knockout and insertion approach. Together with this significant internal effort in developing novel approaches to viral-based gene delivery, we believe we are becoming leaders in the future of genetics medicines with multiple exciting clinical and near clinical programs&#8230;.</p><p>With the Regeneron Genetic Center as our backbone and our growing external partnerships with like-minded companies, such as Alnylam, Intellia and Decibel, we are well-positioned to be at the forefront of the next wave of biotech innovation. While still in its infancy, we think that these groundbreaking technologies, such as siRNAs, CRISPR-based therapies as well as virally directed gene therapy, have the potential to be just as large as the biologics are today.</p><p>On Slide 23 is a summary of some of our near and longer-term opportunities emerging from our Regeneron Genetic Medicines capabilities. Our strategy involves creating synergistic partnerships that can synchronize with what we can do internally and which can help further empower and build on, resulting in world-leading turnkey therapeutic solutions that can yield entire pipelines, all going after targets elucidated and validated biogenetics, giving us the highest chance of success in the clinic.</p></blockquote><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32d56615-4409-409a-accb-f47c27841be6_906x491.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32d56615-4409-409a-accb-f47c27841be6_906x491.png" width="906" height="491" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/32d56615-4409-409a-accb-f47c27841be6_906x491.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:491,&quot;width&quot;:906,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:289077,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32d56615-4409-409a-accb-f47c27841be6_906x491.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32d56615-4409-409a-accb-f47c27841be6_906x491.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32d56615-4409-409a-accb-f47c27841be6_906x491.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32d56615-4409-409a-accb-f47c27841be6_906x491.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>I know I just threw a ton out at you. If I had to sum it up, it would be simply this: VelociSuite and RGC are assets unique to REGN that let them develop drugs faster, cheaper, and smarter than peers. The combo is highly synergistic in discovering new drugs: RGC lets scientists quickly find genes that make a difference in fighting something, and then Velocisuite let&#8217;s REGN quickly test that gene and model how different changes will effect the system. Here&#8217;s an example <a href="https://app.tegus.co/app/transcript/28044#highlighted-span--853920">one of the experts gave</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I was working with the bacteria. So I was very interested.</p><p>I was working in such a way that some of the diseases that I was looking into, especially the bacterial disease. What I was looking into is like if you shut off one of the genes, it makes a huge difference. Like, to put it in basic words, it's like my blood and your blood is totally different. If I have something else in my blood, it will make the bacteria kill faster than yours.</p><p>So for that, I think that Regeneron Genetics Center made a huge, huge difference, for me to get into, because I would get into samples, which is like almost like 200 people, and that would give a huge difference. And I would take that and put it into a mouse strategy, how will I make my mouse model in such a way that I can address these kind of questions.</p></blockquote><p>The power and speed of these two working together is probably most evident in how quickly <a href="https://app.tegus.co/app/transcript/28044#highlighted-span--853920">REGN was able to develop COVID antibodies</a></p><blockquote><p>when COVID came about, I think RGC played a huge, huge, roll along with VelociGene. So I think COVID , at that time, they could get a lot of monoclonal antibodies, and that made a huge difference.</p></blockquote><p>Obviously, velocisuite and RGC are unique and valuable assets. Which again begs the question: why can&#8217;t competitors with R&amp;D budgets multiples of REGN&#8217;s recreate these assets over time?</p><p>REGN&#8217;s CSO has suggested that larger companies can&#8217;t copy these in part because of their cultures; other pharma companies are more concerned with making money in the short term than investing into the technology for the long term, and because of that concern &#8220;big pharma&#8221; can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t match REGN&#8217;s investment. In fact, he want so far as to <a href="https://www.bamsec.com/transcripts/14898436">suggest BMS acquired and then killed a potential competitor of REGN&#8217;</a>s</p><blockquote><p>we view our partners essentially as extensions of our laboratories. And our folks, led by the leaders that you've heard from, are working hand in hand in all of the collaborations that we're talking about. I think that our strategy very much depends on these partners being independently structured and incentivized.</p><p>We don't want to do what, for example, BMS did to Medarex. We think Medarex was a great company. It could have been a great competitor of ours in the human antibody space. But for those of you who've been around long enough to remember, BMS bought them for essentially their first 2 antibodies, their PD-1 and the CTLA-4 antibodies. And you haven't heard anything about that technology since then because they brought it in-house and essentially killed the company. So we don't want that to happen.</p></blockquote><p>There could be some truth to that &#8220;our culture eats other&#8217;s&#8221; theory; in fact, multiple experts suggested that REGN&#8217;s culture is an edge in hiring because the best people in the field want to go work for them (similar to how the best in finance generally want to go to Goldman). Still, the &#8220;culture as a moat&#8221; claim rings a little hollow to me. Again, REGN&#8217;s R&amp;D budget is a fraction of big pharma. Despite that money disadvantage, REGN&#8217;s built a business and assets that are worth almost $100B. I struggle to believe big pharma wouldn&#8217;t throw a few billion dollars/year at this problem every year for the next five years if it could come close to recreating what REGN has.</p><p>I thought<a href="https://app.tegus.co/app/transcript/28044#highlighted-span--853920"> one of the experts gave a more plausible explanation </a>for REGN&#8217;s moat on the RGC side: forming partnerships with medical centers for genetic data was a land grab, and REGN recognized that and grabbed all the partnerships before anyone else was aware of the opportunity:</p><blockquote><p>what Regeneron being, they collaborate with a lot of hospitals they did. And especially if you get your hands on to like different tissues and blood samples and saliva, whatever you can think of, that helps a lot. And I think that is a big bank right there, which nobody has touched yet. Because people don't know what to do with them and what happens is they stop with the genotyping, but that sequencing is what RGC gets to done. And I think because of that, they made a huge bank. Hope that makes sense, yes&#8230;.</p><p>nobody looked into this before. And I think that is the reason, if you will go to like Pfizers or the Mercks or the big companies, they definitely have a genetic place where people are looking into all of the genetic sequencing. But the sequencing takes time. It will take you a longer time than you expected while RGC made into one of those.</p></blockquote><p>That early land grab has given REGN a sustainable advantage; the expert suggested what takes REGN ~5 days would take other companies more than a month, and that gap continues to widen. In fact, the expert suggested it would take other companies &#8220;another ten years&#8221; to get to where REGN is today (and, of course, REGN will be significantly faster by then).</p><p>So, at this point, hopefully I&#8217;ve convinced you that Regeneron has some unique and valuable assets that let them develop drugs faster, smarter, and cheaper than competitors, and REGN is literally a decade ahead of competitors.</p><p>But my worry is that lead isn&#8217;t as crucial as it seems. The expert suggested that, five years ago, RGC and veloicuite let REGN do things in six months that competitors couldn&#8217;t do. Today, REGN&#8217;s lead let&#8217;s them do things in five days that take competitors over a month. My worry is that, while REGN can keep a lead, eventually the time difference won&#8217;t matter. To take it to the most extreme, if in 10 years REGN can do something in five seconds that takes competitors 30 seconds&#8230;. well, that&#8217;s still a huge edge, but it probably doesn&#8217;t matter much in the grand scheme of a lengthy drug development. More likely, in ten years, REGN will be able to return data in ~2 days that takes competitors five days. The exec suggested<a href="https://app.tegus.co/app/transcript/28044#highlighted-span--853920"> that gap is probably right at the limit of where REGN</a> would actually have an edge,</p><blockquote><p>Five days, that doesn't make any difference. But at the same time, you can think about what happens is people are, especially in a research lab. In a research lab, we are almost like a day-to-day kind of thing. It's like we need the information as soon as possible so we can start our next study. And I'm talking about study, meaning it's like 140 animals, 150 animals. That's a lot of money. And if you think about if one information is wrong in this, all the money goes down the drain. So yes, between three to two days, it doesn't make any difference. But when it comes to like ten days to two, yes, it does make a big difference then.</p></blockquote><p>Of course, RGC is not REGN&#8217;s only edge. The mice are a huge edge for REGN as well, and, to date, no competitor has been able to copy that technology.</p><blockquote><p>My main thing is Regeneron probably has this capability that other people don't, and I do not know how to emphasize that more than basically, they just go in and change this, which other people cannot do it yet. So I don't know what the proprietary is, but I think that could be a reason why they have not done it. And this is what I'm talking about, like you take a cell and basically modify the gene and that takes a lot of difference.</p><p>It's not like, okay, I have a cell in a Petri dish and I'm just going to go in and change it out. That is not the thing. So it has to be done in a totally different way to get it done. And then only you have to again put it back into the mouse and then breed it out. I think that breeding technology is another thing that Regeneron has, which none of the people have come up with yet. So I think that is the main reason, but I cannot exactly tell you what is the one thing that Regeneron has that people couldn't copy.</p></blockquote><p>So, at this point, I hope I&#8217;ve got you up to speed with where I am. RGC and VelociSuite are real assets and give REGN a real moat currently, but I still have questions around how durable they&#8217;ll prove in the long term. That&#8217;s ok; sometimes everything doesn&#8217;t have to click at once. REGN&#8217;s in my &#8220;too hard&#8221; pile for now, but it&#8217;s crazy interesting, and these calls helped me get up to speed on a fascinating company. I&#8217;ll be following REGN going forward; who knows, maybe one day something will click and I&#8217;ll take a position! </p><p><strong>Odds and ends</strong></p><ul><li><p>I spent all of the post talking about RGC and VelociSuite, and basically none of it talking about REGN&#8217;s current portfolio. That was intentional: there are plenty of companies with interesting drugs, but none that I&#8217;m aware of with unique assets like RGC and VelociSuite that give a company a sustainable edge in developing therapeutics faster and cheaper. If you&#8217;re interested, EYLEA is REGN&#8217;s big drug, and<a href="https://app.tegus.co/app/transcript/26836"> this call goes into great detail on the drug</a>, its potential competitors, and how its method of delivery (an injection in the eye) creates a nice little moat.</p></li><li><p>That focus also meant I didn&#8217;t spend lots of time talking about all of REGN&#8217;s growth opportunities and pipeline drugs. Again, there are tons, and REGN talks about them in lots of their conferences if you&#8217;re interested in them. That&#8217;s what makes diligencing a pharma/bio company so hard; so many different assets to look at. But what I really wanted to focus on was the assets that made REGN most unique, and (again) to me that was clearly RGC and VelociSuite.</p><ul><li><p>Just to show one example of a growth opportunity: here&#8217;s a quote Elliot highlighted for me (<a href="https://www.bamsec.com/transcripts/15125544">from this presentation</a>). Sure, it&#8217;s a little technical, but a quote that shows them solving &#8220;the third rail of immunology&#8221; I think does a great job of highlighting both REGN&#8217;s growth possibilities and how unique their assets / tech is.</p></li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p>They need a costimulatory signal, Signal 2, which is usually delivered by a molecule called CD28. CD28 is the canonical costimulatory antigen.</p><p>CD28 has a checkered history. About 10 years ago -- or actually a little bit more than 10 years ago, I think it was almost 15 years ago, this company, TeGenero, tried to develop an anti-CD28 for immunologic -- as an immunologic therapy and took it through preclinical models, where it didn't see any worrisome issues and exposed healthy volunteers, half a dozen at the same time, and all of them became very sick, and they had severe cytokine release and several of them almost died. So as a consequence, people felt that you have to avoid CD28.It's like a third rail of immunology that you shouldn't touch.</p><p>Our scientists sought out to determine, if you looked at the variety of other molecules and signals on the T cell surface, and there are many, that we believe also play costimulatory roles, which of the molecules is the most important. And repeatedly, they found that, indeed, it is CD28. So we decided to bite the bullet and say, "Okay, let's make a better CD28-engaging molecule." And what we did was create bispecifics that target a tumor antigen and then also target CD28, but that do not activate the CD28 pathway on T cells unless you have this three-part party going on: the costim bispecific, the lymphocyte and the tumor cell. If you just expose the molecule to T cells, it's essentially inert. So we felt that with that, we have a safe approach to do this.</p><p>Now why is this important with regard to solid tumors versus hematologic malignancies? Well, the CD28 molecule interacts with the molecule on antigen-presenting cells called B7. And this B7 can be expressed on dendritic cells, macrophages as well as B cells. B cells can be antigen-presenting cells. And the lymphomas that we treat are B-cell lymphomas, DLBCL, follicular lymphoma, multiple myeloma is a B-cell malignancy. And so perhaps one of the reasons why the CD3 engagers or why the CAR-Ts have been successful is that they are getting some of this B7/CD28 costimulation just as a consequence of the disease that's being targeted. Solid tumors that are composed of epithelial cells, by and large, or epithelial derived from epithelial cells or adenomatous cells don't generally express B7. So they don't provide this costimulatory signal.</p><p>And what our costim bispecifics do is essentially fake out the immune system and basically put the ability to engage CD28 on the tumor cell. So now you're making the tumor cell a more effective antigen-presenting cell. So you see -- you can combine this with either a CD3 bispecific that will engage Signal 1 and you can combine it with anti-PD-1, which will augment the signaling through the intrinsic TCR that of a T cell that already recognizes the tumor.</p></blockquote><ul><li><p>I&#8217;ve been a little skeptical of corporate culture &#8220;moat&#8221; for a variety of reasons (Activision<a href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-recognized-fortunes-100-best-companies-1"> was winning best place to work for years on</a> end while employees were<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680"> apparently spending more time sexually harassing each other</a> than working), but one thing that shined through these calls is REGN does seem to have a good culture. I asked every expert if they would feel comfortable investing in REGN, and each of them was a reasonably enthusiastic &#8220;yes.&#8221; That doesn&#8217;t happen often; expert calls are generally done with former execs or competitors, and there&#8217;s a lot of potential for bitterness or anger with that category. Obviously a small sample size, but my experience suggests it&#8217;s pretty rare to talk to three formers and have all of them speak highly of a company.</p><ul><li><p>In particular, I&#8217;d note the formers gave op management <a href="https://app.tegus.co/app/transcript/26836">high marks </a>as &#8220;very intelligent&#8221; and &#8220;some of the smartest people I&#8217;ve ever met.&#8221;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>I&#8217;m still trying to settle on what company / industry to do for my third entry in this series; if you have suggestions, please<a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewRangeley"> feel free to lob them into my DMs</a>.</p></li></ul><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tim Weber updates $AMPY and talks the double dogs (Podcast #99)]]></title><description><![CDATA[Tim Weber returns to the podcast to provide an update on AMPY and discuss his double dog index.

Hello. Welcome to Yet Another Value Podcast. I'm your host, Andrew Walker, and with me today, I'm happy to have, Tim Weber. My friend, second time on the podcast. Tim is a private investor. Tim, how's it going?<br><br><strong>Tim Weber</strong>: Hey, Andrew. Thanks for having me. The real reason I'm on today is because I'm just trying to catch up with Jeremy Raper. I really appreciate it. I know I have a lot of work to do, but you never know. I could get there someday. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yes. I think Jeremy's at six or seven and this is two for you. You've got a lot of work to catch up on if you want to catch up to him. But, hey, let me start this podcast--<br><br><strong>Tim:</strong> That's okay. I'm the tortoise and he's the hare.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Let me start this podcast the way I do every podcast. First, a disclaimer to remind everyone nothing on this podcast is investing advice. I'll use the same disclaimer we used for Tim's first podcast. That disclaimer is particularly true today. We're going to be talking about a heavily leveraged micro-cap oil and gas stock and some heavily leveraged commodity names later in the podcast. Everyone should remember, these are much higher risk names than normal. Please do your own work, consult a financial advisor, not financial advice.<br><br>A second quick disclaimer, Tim and I had a little bit of technical difficulties. I think he's on a slight lag. If you're watching on YouTube or you notice a slight pause, it's just because of that. But I don't think it's going to cause any issues today. The third pitch for you, people can go listen to the first podcast we did, but you're a great guy, a super-sharp investor. <br><br>AMPY has been just an absolute killer. You nailed that thesis in the fog of war. When I go back and listen to all the stuff we talked about then, I'm always like, "Oh, man, we really nailed this." Why weren't we five thousand times bigger when the stock was trading at three because right now it's tapping at the door of six dollars per share. <br><br>But this was great, the Double Dogs you're going to talk about has been fantastic. Look, I'm just really excited to talk in the podcast. All that out of the way, today, we're going to talk Double Dogs and an update on AMPY. I think it makes the most sense to start with the update on AMPY, so I'll turn it over to you. Since our last podcast which was in the fog of war, right after the oil spill, what's been going on with AMPY?<br><br><strong>Tim:</strong> Yes, Andrew. The incident was October 1st, and I think we did it within one week of the incident. We were really just trying to take any information we could get our hands on and just frame the incident. And so there's been a lot that has transpired since then. I'm going to try and give you what I feel is the most important, but if I missed anything, just come right back to it. I've written about this on my Substack, but really, I tried to frame the incident whether it was the size of the incident, the insurance coverage, comparing it to incidents in the past. I just tried to frame it when we were in the fog of war and just say, "Okay, it's going to kill the company." I mean, it was that bad at first, right? You couldn't quantify the gross liability. You were just starting to understand what insurance might look like. The size of the incident was still a little bit in question.<br><br>For sure, the culpability of the incident was a total unknown. A lot of that has changed. I'm just going to go through a few of the things that have happened since the incident. First, on December 15th, the federal grand jury brings one misdemeanor charge against $AMPY for negligent discharge of oil, which, to me, was a huge win. We did a lot of comparing to the Plains All American incident. In that case, there was--<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> When they put out the press release or whatever that said, one misdemeanor. I was like, "Oh," my first thought was, "Oh, no, I was hoping they would get away." And Tim was texting me, "LFG! LFG! To the moon!"<br><br><strong>Tim:</strong> I don't remember that but I'm sure I did it.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> It wasn't quite that but it was pretty much.<br><br><strong>Tim:</strong> So in that Plains All American incident, there were 46 charges brought of which four were felonies, right? So just that as a first path and there were some differences. For example, a lot of those charges were brought by the state of California, whereas this is a federal grand jury. It gives you a good sense of kind of the differences in the incidents here. We'll get to why these incidents were so different when we talk about the lawsuit, which AMPY just filed a few weeks ago. So 46 charges versus 1, that was your first real, I mean, look, we had a lot. There were a lot of speculation that things were going to work out here and that this incident could be contained and that there would be great insurance coverage and that sort of thing but that was one of the first things in print where you started to kind of have a sigh of relief. <br><br>So recently, March 2nd, Amplify filed a lawsuit against three parties. MSC which was the owner of the Demit vessel in question likely targeted the anchor on their pipeline. Costco is the owner of the Beijing vessel. Then also Marine Exchange, which you actually mentioned in your podcast, is essentially the air traffic controller and the region. All of these parties in the complaint had knowledge of the incident and did not notify Amplify, all three parties. So they filed this lawsuit, you can go and find it. If you're super interested in reading, it's actually pretty, pretty interesting, and entertaining. Some of the details in the lawsuit, maybe made me very bullish. <br><br>So the P&amp;I Clubs for both MSC and Costco posted in the maritime industry is known as a letter of undertaking. So this is when your P&amp;I Club posts on your behalf basically a letter of credit, you know, stating that in exchange for you the aggrieved party, in this case, Amplify not arresting the vessels, which would be a huge problem if you think about how much money container shipping is making on you know, on a trip by trip basis right now. So, in exchange for AMPY not arresting the vessel, the P&amp;I Club for MSC posted and it was quantified a $97.5 million letter of undertaking, which essentially says if we are found liable for the damages and your claim was indeed real, here's a letter of undertaking for up to 97 and a half million dollars. Costco posted a letter of undertaking as well. Sorry. Costco's P&amp;I Club also posted a similar letter of undertaking but it was not quantified in the lawsuit, I'm not sure exactly why but if we assume that it's approximately the same value as the MSE letter of undertaking, we're talking about nearly $200 million on letters that have been posted to Amplify, which is well in excess of what Amplify in its recent 10k estimates the total value of the incident. Now, of course, the total [crosstalk], it's almost a moot point.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> If I remember correctly, the estimate was 99 million. I think that's right, or was it?<br><br><strong>Tim:</strong> Okay.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Okay, just to give readers-- [crosstalk]<br><br><strong>Tim:</strong> Exactly. Right, but again, the 99 is somewhat a moot point to the stock itself, just because insurance coverage, which I'll talk about next, has come in so favorable in print. So basically, you've got these two letters of undertaking. You read this too and it feels like Amplify has an incredibly strong case against both shipowners, as well as the, they call them the air traffic control, their name is Marine Exchange. My guess is that what happens is there's some sort of reasonable settlement here. However, I would say there is that probability that if this gets litigated, Amplify is, of course, they're suing for both damages, which is more of a matter for their insurance company, frankly, but its damage and reputation, right? <br><br>And so there is this, it's funny, because you asked me this question on the first podcast, and I laughed when you ask that you said, "Hey, Tim, is there any chance if this anchor scenario is true? Is there any chance that there was zero net liability or even positive?" And I sort of laughed, right? Now, it seems like that is actually an option on the table. So that's kind of bright, when my guess is that, we have a really good estimate of what the incident is going to cost and the insurance coverage is extremely high, and then we're talking 90% or more. Even the leakage will be, you know, the leakage will be essentially what Amplify is asking for in the settlement, I would guess. But again, if you litigate, and you get to the point of reputational damage, that's where you could be in the zone of even positivity. <br><br>My guess is that the way that it plays out is that there's some sort of settlement, which is terrible, the leakage, the deductibles, the things that just for whatever reason, the insurance did not cover, plus, Amplify's loss of production, income insurance. You kind of resign that insurance each year, and they had basically lost their loss of production income at a really low oil price at the end of 2020. So you could argue that when they locked off of production in the high 40s yet oil goes $30-40 higher in the next year. My guess is that that would be something on the table if we're sitting around the table trying to come up with a settlement. So we're talking, it seems to me to be getting more clear each day that this is a zero net liability issue. Now, of course, the next big question is okay, but when will the pipeline operate again? Before I go there, there's this loss of production income insurance will cover 18 months. So we are not even six months post-incident right now and the time to fix the pipeline was measured in weeks, not months. It's actually a very straightforward fix.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> So let me pause you there because I think we're going to start talking about beta coming back online and everything in a second, which is kind of upside case at this point right? But I just was there when we talked last, I think it was a popular podcast, listeners should go back and listen to it if they want to but when we talked last, we were worried that AMPY was going to be on the hook, we were trying to size the liability, we didn't know because of the fog of war. At this point, we do know the liability, right? The max liability is kind of 100 million, maybe beta never restarts probably does. I mean, we're gonna talk about that in a second. But we can size the liability. So we know the max liability is 100 million, and most of that would get covered by insurance. Our hope here is that insurance will get will require a lot of that from the shipping company, whatever insurance doesn't cover, AMPY will recall from the shipping company in the suit and maybe you asked me when I mentioned it, but now it doesn't seem so silly. Maybe we get little reputational damage and AMPY actually makes money off that. Was that a good summary of where we are with the legal liabilities, the cleanup, and everything at that point?<br><br><strong>Tim:</strong> Yeah, I think that's fair. I was just going to mention that in the interim since we did the first podcast, there has been a 10-Q and a 10-K file. The first 10-Q gave you the big glimmer of hope that insurance coverage was looking great. The second report and the 10-K gave you, you know, you never use the word certainty but gave you a lot of confidence that the insurance coverage was more than sufficient.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Perfect. So that brings us today as we talk, AMPY stock is you know, it is March. Is it March 16th? It's St. Patrick's, March 17th.<br><br><strong>Tim:</strong> How could you say that on St. Patty's Day?<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> I know, I know. I'm wearing white, somebody's probably gonna have to pinch me but on March 17th, AMPY stock is around $5.70 per share. And I mentioned that because I want to talk about why it's right here, right? Because people can go look at AMPY's investor deck, and they put out, "Hey, here's how much free cash flow we're gonna, we think we're gonna generate over the next couple of years." "Hey, here's our PV 10, at the end of the year 2021 strip, and here's our PV 10 at the current strip, which by the way, the current strip is a lot higher than the year 2021." They say, "Hey, we think beta is going to restart in the next couple of months and we build some of that into our model, and I don't think the market really believes that." So I want to talk through all of those things and why kind of AMPY is where it is right now.<br><br><strong>Tim:</strong> Yeah, and it's funny because Amplify was at almost exactly the same stock price the day before the incident. So if I mess up my 575, that's only because the stock was exactly there before the incident. So the day before the incident. Let's let's rewind. So when I wrote this up, I actually wrote it up a few weeks before the incident. So I mean, I'm sure the oil market moved, oil and gas moved a little bit, but probably not much. But I was essentially saying, Okay, here's what I know is this is assuming every asset is operating, right? And I said in 2023 because they had they have some below market hedges in '21 and '22. I said if I look out to 2023 and I simply just put three to four times EBITDA on what I expect them to do at the current strip, including all the hedges because there's still a little bit of hedging in 23. I said I think this stock can be worth $10 to $13 per share. At that time, the oil 23 strip was $62, gas was 350. NGOs were around I think I had $25 in my model for 20. If I mark these market now. First of all, marking to market the 23 strips right now, my EBITDA in that prior scenario was 123 million on all assets. Again, this assumes beta is operating. It is now 212 million. Now what there's going to be $10 million of restart costs, I'm sure for data but it just put that aside for a moment, which again, EBITDA has gone--<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> $10 million which probably gets covered by insurance or the ships in the lawsuit right?<br><br><strong>Tim:</strong> I would say more than that, probably more than the settlement you would go for that and then insurance but you know, let's see. So again EBITDA market has gone from 123 to 210. So that's a 90 million increase in EBITDA and a company that has a market cap today of 220 million, the new range at three to four times EBITDA rather than that $10 to $13 and $19 to $23. So you could say, "Okay, Tim, the stock was at 575, who cares, it was at a huge discount, or made up three times EBITDA multiple in 23." Right? To which I would say, sure, it was at a 40% discount, you know, two to the three times EBITDA number in 23. That same 40% discount is now $11. To me, what closes the gap to that $11 are two things, and it's going to preview what we're going to talk about next. <br><br>What could close that gap is, of course, getting your permits, which Amplify needs, in order to do, let's call it a two to six-week fix that will be required to get beta operating again. The other one is actually crystallizing some of the value through a sale, which is a whole different topic that we can kind of move to next. But again, the equivalent of Amplify being at 575. When they're three times EBITDA, which is, by the way, that's three to four times EBITDA to somewhat decent approximation for what they say that PV 10 is the equivalent today is an $11 stock on a company that's trading at five-eight today. So to me, you've got this really big upside catalyst that will be you know, will start to be crystallized, I think, when you get your permits, do your work on beta then if you sell an asset. <br><br>Which leads me to my next point, which is that as Amplify reported and started doing investor presentations again, and get a conference call again because they had skipped last quarter, just as they were in the fog of war. One of to me, the most important disclosure, possibly in that release, is that they're selling their non-operating Eagle Ford asset. Now, this is the smallest of five assets, it only has a $50 million PV 10, compared to a PV 10 for the whole company that's approaching $1 billion. So it's a relatively small asset in the grand scheme of things but symbolically, it's a way to use the proceeds to pay down debt. They have a reserve base lending facility, which is too large, and which just introduces kind of, I would argue stakeholder conflict shareholders versus banks, which will be a good thing to wind down over time. <br><br>So Amplify is actively marketing this non-operating asset, and it should be a relatively straightforward sale, right? I mean, a financial buyer could look at it, or the majority operator could look at it, which in this case is Murphy. This is a big positive because any stock can be at a huge discount to fair value, it does not matter if there's not a path to close, if there's not a path that closes this current trading price versus, you know, versus what you have in your mob or versus what Amplify has in their deck irrelevant, right? They don't trade an asset at PV 11, let's say, then that implies that the whole company is worth $20, right? I would argue, if you pick apart each one of their assets, you can make a really strong case for why each one could trade a PV 10 Right now, yeah. And again, that PV 10 is a two handle on it right now, and two zero. This is a $5.80 stock, right? So, to me, again, there's a little bit of this is this is somewhat symbolic, this is somewhat about just reducing the size of the RBL. But to me, what's really important is that if this asset trades and trades that you know, PV 10 to PV 12 This really does, it's a lot harder to make that argument that, who cares, it's just a theoretical value in your spreadsheet.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Let me give you the most, the pushback on that right so I hear you you know, bull you know, I'm with you here but Eagle Ford as you said is a non operated acid I believe you go for it's the only non-operated asset. Right. So I think you and I as generalists you know, generals generally get their face ripped off in oil and gas. I think our first thought was Eagle Ford is their worst asset because it's a non-operated asset. And I believe we've heard a little bit of scuttle blurb essentially thinking about that we are actually wrong right there like no Eagle Ford's probably your best asset on a PV 10. Because anyone can buy it. It's really simple, right? There's lots of you can have financial buyers, they can just come in and say oh, cool, we'll just cash those checks. You can have the A you can have the majority producer buy it you can somebody's just looking for a little asset diversification and to get kind of into southern Texas if they don't have oil and gas exposure there, right? So it's small, it's probably really easy to just flip it to a variety of buyers, whereas everything else they have, I believe is operated by them. So buyers have to do a lot more due diligence, there are fewer buyers, they have to make a lot more assumptions on that there's kind of no one, you know, in this case, Murphy, who's the majority owner on Eagle Ford is kind of backstopping a lot of the assumptions there. So, I think my first pushback would be if I saw a press release tomorrow, that's an Eagle Ford sold for about PV 10. I would be like, Oh, yes, stock to the moon. But some people might say, Oh, well, you know, everything else, you can't value everything else at PV 10. Because it's so different. How would you respond to that pushback?<br><br><strong>Tim:</strong> I would just say, you know, each asset is going to have its own peculiarities. You know, the fact that it's not operated means definitionally there's no paying up for any incremental development opportunities, or any idiosyncratic, you know, benefits to that asset. So let me just give you two examples. The range, the assets, the Colorado assets, J have this angle where, you know, it's enhanced oil recovery using co2 ESG, positive 45 Q tax credits, which Amplify is not currently receiving, I believe the way that it works is that Exxon receives the credits right now. But what if somebody had a strategy to use the co2 and to get the 45 Q credits? Let's say for as one example is the East Texas assets. Do you have incremental drilling opportunities? You know, there is a double-spend cutback there at, obviously, with today's natural gas strip, incredibly high our IRR. So I would say each asset has, you know, its own peculiarities which, which, you know, certain buyers might see as a positive. So what we did, we obviously listed what the positive on the ego for it is, it's just the financial transaction, right? I mean, you know, if I'm Murphy, it's a $50 million on my revolver cost me a million dollars a year of interest expense. Right. So, you know, a pretty straightforward transaction.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> And this doesn't apply to Amplify in particular, but I've been really into a I've spent a lot of time looking at recently, all the controlled MLPs from the giant companies. So a great one right now is shell is talking about buying shallots, which I've talked about a no. Matt Turk has been on the podcast talked about, uh, they're looking to take them out, right, they filed a thing that said, Hey, we own 70% of you will flip you, and all the MLPs have been doing this because look, the MLPs yield to the equity 10%, right, they own these great pipelines, they yield 10%. And I think shell and all these guys are looking say, well, with oil Presper there are we need to start drilling some more, we need to control our infrastructure. And by the way, debt-equity yields 10%, we can go buy it, and we can issue debt at 40 Your debt at 3%. To buy it like it's super creative for us to go buy it anyway. So with exactly what you say, with Murphy, they can look and say, oh well amplifies the cost of equity cost of capital right now is probably 15% implied by the market, our cost of capital is 4%, we can split the difference at 10%. And everybody's gonna be super happy with that. <br><br><strong>Tim:</strong> Right, and to me, there's a lot of financial buyers that could actually, you know, if you're a financial buyer, there's no reason that you wouldn't look at the same opportunity and say, Oh, with no sweat off my back and no work, I can make this sort of IRR, right, which is only meaningful. Because you're you know, you're not operating assets. So I do think that one could be interesting. And again, I mean, I don't think the markets are ready for this company selling an asset or to at TV test, for sure. Otherwise, the stock would not be here.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> I want to talk beta, but you just said the stock would not be here. So let's talk about a couple of other pushbacks. You know, I think the other pushback I get is, "Tim, Andrew, you guys are generalists, y'all are interested in Amplify because it trades at this huge discount to PV 10. Now there's these really sexy catalysts with beta coming back online or winning a lawsuit or selling your ego for that close to PV 10." But you know, well you were here before this, Phil but a lot of people say look before the spill, PV 10 was $12 per share, and the stock traded at 5. Today PV 10 is probably 20 in the stock trades at almost six but PV 10. You know, there's a beta risk. There's all sorts of other concerns. There's probably some concern that you know, the trend path for oil and gas prices is probably lower, not higher if you assume geopolitical tensions are cooled down just a little bit. There's probably a little bit of geopolitical premium. Not to say couldn't go higher, but there's probably a little geopolitical premium there. I don't know what I'm saying on that. But you know, I think a lot of people say hey, you're just interested in this because of these situations. But the best thing, gas investors have looked at this. And for years, they've said, these are awful assets. We don't want to have them like it trades, it should trade for huge discounts, PV 10. And the current share price kind of implies the same discount to PV 10, as it did before beta. So how would you respond to that pushback?<br><br><strong>Tim:</strong> I mean, I think oil and gas investors can't really invest in $150 million market cap special situation. So it's almost, it's almost a moot point.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> They've all gotten so rich for the past 18 months that this is too small for them.<br><br><strong>Tim:</strong> I mean, you could make a similar argument for you know, that small-cap Canadian ENPs make just as little sense, in terms of, they've got shallow decline curves that are trading at crazy, call it free cash flow and yields. Those don't make a lot of sense either, and a lot of incredibly smart oil and gas folks are making great, great money on Canadian small caps. I would argue that there's a little bit of kind of the same energy here. Look at the beta California risk specifically, you can't rule out that California won't try to intervene here. Of course, the way that I'm framing it is, like, I'm sure they could figure out some way to file an injunction. I'm sure if they do this, you know, a federal judge would have to overturn that. By the way, I have a lot of confidence that it would be overturned because jurisdictionally This happened in federal waters.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> With that, one second. Yeah. I think you jumped ahead. So where I was going next, you knew where I was going. But the beta California risk is a lot of people are concerned beta, as Tim was saying is in federal waters. But a lot of people have been concerned that California because beta spilled off the coast of California, California will somehow try to stop beta, the asset that Amplify errands that cause this oil spill, they'll try to stop beta from restarting even though the jurisdiction should be with federal because this is federal water. So please continue. I just wanted to give that background.<br><br><strong>Tim:</strong> Oh, yeah, no, that's fair. So look, I think I can't rule out the California risk here. And it's obviously not the most friendly jurisdiction in the world. Now, one could argue that that's probably going to be teaming right now, I would argue that oil and gas production, you know, is a few more geopolitical incidents away from being a patriotic positive, which is a whole total sentiment shift from-- [crosstalk]<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> One thing I've been thinking about is I know a lot of people, especially institutional firms, who would not touch anything defense, or guns and ammo-related. And all of a sudden, a month ago, here we are today after Russia invades Ukraine, the EU just made guns in defense, stocks, investing whatever. They made them ESG friendly and I have been thinking like things that were politically unacceptable. Like, as times change oil and gas in six months, it could be ESG friendly to say, hey, in the short term, we need to do this. And you know, I'm sure on long term, like, we still need to go green and everything but in the short term, these could be as friendly moves.<br><br><strong>Tim:</strong> Yeah, and look, and so the way that I'm framing it is, you just compare, you know, you compare what some other spills have looked like versus what this one looks like. And, you know, just given what's going on with with with oil prices right now, and how much of a hot button political issue this has become? Are you really going to shoot your bullet here, if you're California on a lawsuit, that, by the way, has an enormous uphill battle? So look, but Could something be? Could it injunction be filed? Of course, will the stock go down 10-15% that day? Of course, right? All that, my base case is that what that will do is simply just went out to get beta operating again. I mean, look, all this math we've been doing is on 23 Anyways, right? You know, so it would push your timeframe out, they have a loss of production income insurance for 18 months, and we're only six months into the incident right now. We're only six months post-incident right now. And so, you know, but you can't roll it out, of course. But again, you know, if this was a state really trying to fire a bullet, one misdemeanor is what they came up with. And by the way, this, any spotlight on this whole issue, you really highlight a lot of malfeasance on the traffic that was allowed to congregate in the outside of the Port of Long Beach. So this is not so straightforward. It's a losing political issue. There's no question about it. You know, anything, anything restraining the American oil project right now is it's just not the moment. So, look, that's me playing political analyst, which you should, that in a quarter we'll get you--<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Get you nothing these days. <br><br><strong>Tim:</strong> Yeah, there's my thought.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> I think we've covered most of the stuff I wanted to talk about Amplify here. I mean, like this is, it's funny, it's an under $400 million. It's about a $400 million EV company. but there's so many different things assets, angles to talk about. Are there any angles you wanted to... I mean, I think both of them are agreed, it trades at a huge discount of PV 10. I think both of us think beta is coming online. Even if it doesn't, I think the stock works pretty well from here to be honest, just given that big discount in the free cash flow going through. anything else you want to talk about on Amplify before we maybe quickly hit the Double Dogs?<br><br><strong>Tim:</strong> Just two things. Number one, it's just always important to step back. What this was before the incident and what it is today has not changed. This is the most leveraged US-based expression of higher oil prices. There's operational leverage because they're higher costs, oil, for example, there's financial leverage, because they have debt. Then there's tremendous potential for valuation expansion because of where they trade. The three of those synergistically interacting, make this the best way to express a higher oil and gas deck. You know, that's just the math generally but there's a little bit of qualitative judgment within that statement, but largely, that's just the math. So that's one point. <br><br>Then the other point, I would just say, this management team has handled this incredibly well. They've been level-headed, they are talking to shareholders, they're taking shareholder input. I would argue that shareholder input is part of the reason why Eagle Ford is being marketed right now. And look, shareholders don't love having this major other stakeholders in the RBL, which might not always act in the best interest of stockholders. So I would argue that management are doing the right thing in terms of look, and they're getting a lot of feedback from a lot of different stakeholders right now but they're not blocking out shareholders in the way that some companies do when they kind of go into hiding in the middle of a crisis. I would argue that the CEO and CFO have handled this really well, from a shareholder perspective, which is obviously my last take.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Perfect. Yeah, I think the only other thing I'll just briefly mention, I know both of you, and I, well, you're the one who pointed out. We were worried because this is a company that hedges a lot. We were worried about the beta hedges because you know, they had been put on in 2021 and beta isn't exactly producing now. We've been worried about that, or we've been worried about what I'll call the Peabody risk, where your hedges go so deep out of the money, you have to post collateral and you have to raise equity to post that collateral, even though you're going to produce that stuff, right? And both of those are off the table. The company wisely took off all the beta hedges when beta shut down, which saved them, I think, like 20 to $30 million so that was great. <br><br><strong>Tim:</strong> It's $66.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yeah, and now if beta comes online, they'll be minting money off beta that's completely on hedge, and then be I looked through their 10k and they also confirmed on the earnings call. I don't believe that these not that they can burn through it but you can see because they haven't had to, they don't have to post collateral on their hedges as well. So on both those cases, I think those are two tail risks that have been removed or we can feel reasonably good about. Let's turn to the Double Dogs. Tim is the one who introduced the Double Dogs. I think both of us were kind of thinking along the same lines because my 2022 prediction said deep value stocks outperform, I cited a couple of cyclicals. Tim went even harder he found 10 or 15 cyclicals across the board that traded super cheaply. But I shouldn't be talking, I should turn it over to the founder of Double Dogs. Tim, can you explain the Double Dogs? Why you came up with it, how it's performed, and we can talk about a couple of the names?<br><br><strong>Tim:</strong> Yes, for sure. So all throughout last year, I look at new names and hear different pitches. I kept coming back to this question that I was asking myself, but also that I would frequently hear from others as, for example, I was doing a lot of work on Arch. And the question was always wait for a second, if your numbers are even in the right ballpark, in the right stadium, how can this trade exist? That makes no sense. So I was doing all this soul searching on that question and a lot of folks were talking about it and posting about it with their own language, you know, and I'm running everything down so thoroughly in the case of Arch, it's misplaced ESG aggression, is it because Macro is just going to implode, and I just don't know about it. Maybe it's the spotted path of coal management teams. <br><br>But what I really started to realize is that there was no sense in running this down from an idiosyncratic perspective, with coal, let's say, because the same setup existed in US Steel. Then the same setup existed in the shipping names. And the same setup existed in the lumber names and some copper names. What I finally realized, and why I wanted to write a post about it is that the common thread that runs through all of these setups was sort of this historically accurate market maxim that you never pay a low multiple for a cyclical, it's been a great market. it's worked well, it saves you a lot of money, right? It sounded logical most of the time but as we're learning with the last couple of years, most of the time keeps getting run over. Your things that used to work most of the time, are no longer holding when we've just had the biggest economic disruption of the last century. You know, which was the biggest economic disruption followed by the most impressive, you know, synchronized global government response to a market disruption of the last century as well.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yeah, can I just add, I'll just add a tangible example. You mentioned United Steel, I did a post at the beginning of the year, United Steel was 20 or 21. And I said, Look, this is a company tangible book value is 28. It's trading for like, one or two times EBITDA two times on levered free cash flow, like everything you're saying, I was like, steel at the time had come down from the peaks of kind of, like summer 2021. But steel was still way above mid-cycle levels. I was like, Look, this company is saying we're gonna print money, print EBITDA, we're buying back shares like crazy, we don't get it. And I posted that and everyone said exactly what you said, the time to buy cyclicals is not when the multiple is low, because that's the beat the time is when to tie and I was like, I get that. But you know, it's low because they've been minting money for nine months. They're not it's not gonna fall off a cliff overnight. And they're buying back shares are crazy. By the way, it's trading below tangible book value. Now, my only wish is I leaned into it harder because the stock's down from 24 to 35. Right now, but I sold that at around Cedral book. But I do want to ask you one question. So the strategies worked great. I want to ask you why all these why no one believed in these multiples would be my first question. And then my second question would be, you know, all of these have really taken off since Russia, invaded Ukraine, and the markets for everything commodity went parabolic. And we can talk about why they went parabolic. But I want to ask, do you think these were going to work if Russia didn't invade Ukraine? Because that's what got us steel working? That's what got a lot of these working.<br><br><strong>Tim:</strong> Oh, for sure. Yeah. So I think that would be after I put 12 names into this index, by the way, it could have been 20. It was funny when I first posted this thread asking for input on names. Folks were getting really emotional about which ones were in or out. And I just said, look, the whole point is just to tell a story anyway, right? It's not that big of a deal, which names are in or out? So yeah, I mean, look that the average stock was up, I think 20% pre-Russia, and now it's a little over 40%. So yes, I think it was working. But it was a trade that was already working. Before I wrote the article, I was looking for terminology to explain it because it was just such a, it was such a unique point in time. And there were so many different folks on, you know, talking about this trade, but everybody had their own language. I was just actually trying to create, you know, kind of a shortcut to "Hey, what are we talking about?" "Oh, we're talking about the same thing." <br><br>Look, I mean, to your first question, commodities have a wave viciously mean reverting, right. And so if you're, if you're paying us four times, EBITDA multiple which would have historically would have been that low multiple that you quote, shouldn't pay on a cyclical, right, that can go to 10 times EBITDA in a flash, you know, if commodity prices get cut in half, which, which, by the way, is almost certainly going to happen in a broad basket of commodities right now, because we've got everything from, I don't know, aluminum is probably 50% Up above its marginal cost of production to coking coal is 300%. Above it's above the marginal cost of production, right? And so the prices are coming down for sure. But look, so you've got that issue where four times EBITDA can turn into 10. That's why that was a great thing, a great market maximum growth Capex as a way of being both destructive to the company. AMD industry. And so another reason why that's been a great market Maxim, m&amp;a has a very spotty track record. You have industries that have had rounds of bankruptcy. So the reason why that market maximum exists is very sound logically, the issue is just that at our current point in time, it just got stretched way, way, way too far. And so if that four times is 1.2, that's different, right? And again, I talked about this before, that's like chiefs Jags last year, if you want to bet on the Chiefs length 14 points, it's a 5050 Bet you want to bet on the Chiefs length 32 points, you know, you should probably take the checks, right? I mean, point two times EBIT, done versus four changes the odds of the trade working by a lock.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> And I think another thing was, it wasn't just I agree with you on the multiples, and it wasn't just like the multiples at one point in time. It happened for like six to nine months, right? So at that point, it wasn't like they were trading super cheaply on some hugely levered bet, right. They made so much money and printed so much free cash flow that by the end of it, they had all this guide us to basically pay down all their net debt, and they were generating all this cash. So it was much different than Oh, it's two times EBITDA but 75% of the Evie is debt. So you're kind of trading levered equity stuff like it just went on for so long that it really deep wrist position. And I'm laughing because, on Bloomberg, somebody just messaged me and said, "Who is T. Web'?" What a brilliant guy, so I'm just laughing.<br><br><strong>Tim:</strong> There's no way there's confirmation bias in that statement. No way.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> But let me ask. So Double Dogs, Double Dogs has worked great. You know, some of the cold names have just been screamers, there have been a couple of years and still, names have ended up working great. Like a lot of them have worked great. Which ones do you think are the best position right now? And I'll include a link to the Double Dogs post in the show notes if you want to go read the original. Which ones do you think you know, if I wanted to jump in on Double Dogs and say it's not too late? Where do you think people should be looking?<br><br><strong>Tim:</strong> Don't do that to me. You know, the few of the bottom performers of these 12 names. Number 12 is resolute forest products. Number 9 is green first, although green first is up 31% and it's number 9 so it feels a little embarrassing to say that it's been a laggard up 31% year to date. But both of those still have a one handle EBITDA multiple and lumber does have some really big structural demand drivers, and some really scary, restricted supply constraints. And so I would argue, look, there's so many different commodities where I get it, it's the scariest thing in the world when the spot price is 100% above the marginal cost of production, it's actually probably 150% for lumber right now. You know, that's scary, right? Because you know, that spot is going lower. And, you know, these equities are, you know, these equities aren't PhDs, they're more like high school students, right? These equities are going down as stock goes down, which was, you know, let's be honest with ourselves. You have one handle EBITDA multiples in the case of what they green first, they did have some net debt post-acquisition, which is going to get rapidly paid down. We're going to be talking about kind of a net cash small-cap in an industry that's rapidly consolidating. So there's probably an m&amp;a bid under the company. Either that or the company should be buying back a ton of stock by the second half of this year. <br><br>And I would argue, of course, lumber is not going to stay at $1,200 but I mean, what I did a write up on green first, and I essentially said, hey, if you believe that there's a one year super spike, but that normalize lumber is 500 versus if you believe there's a one year super spike, but normalized prices are 600. It kind of changes everything, right? I mean, you go up into the right in terms of what the equity might do. There's been a little bit of cost-push so you might want to, you know, take those numbers a bit higher in terms of, okay, you've got to believe that normalized at 650, let's say, right? But if you revert back to 800, let's say, because of these, you know, there's such a structural supply and demand issue and lumber if US housing remains strong, that you're not going back onto the marginal cost, and you're not going back on to the marginal cost curve for potentially a couple of years. And you know, when that's happened in coal right now, your thermal 220 to 250% above its marginal cost curve and coking coal is almost 300% above. And so could that happen in lumber for a couple of years? 100%. There's like, we're in that commodity zone right now, where you just, you're in this kind of shortage. mentality.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> I'm just laughing because you've said lumber down to 800, right? And I agree with everything you said on the supercycle on everything. I'm just laughing because I did a lot of work on green first, when they did the REITs offering I participated, I still own a lot of stock if anybody wants that disclosure, but I remember in their deck, I'm doing this from memory. I'm trying to pull it up, as I say, but remember, in their deck, they were like, hey, you know, lumber is high right now but here's our models with lumber at 650. Right? They were kind of running that as like, a little bit good bull case. And like right now lumber, I think was 13 or 1400 last I checked, and you're saying if it reverts back to 800, which is way above the lumbers they were talking about. And actually, I can't remember exactly, but I think they close like the end of August and they had a market valuation on the lumber when they closed. That's when lumber went from like 12 to 8 now that's 13. So they closed on very advantaged timing, but that's interesting. Yeah, I've looked at RFP in a while, or do they buy back shares actively?<br><br><strong>Tim:</strong> Yeah, I believe they did a big special dividend last year. I think they're in the market. But I'm pretty sure that the dividend was bigger. But don't quote me on that. They're returning capital, but put it this way. They're returning capital actively. And you know, this used to be a company with... their balance sheet was a little scary, right? There's some pretty big post-retirement obligations, that sort of thing. Again, a lot of these other companies, totally like the balance sheets are so clean versus what they used to be, which is why this trade doesn't make any sense, right? I mean, there's 10 reasons we could keep going but you just keep coming back to well, that doesn't make sense. That doesn't make sense because again, you know, if you had a scary balance sheet right now, and you were looking at a super spike, and you were looking at a spot price way above the marginal cost of production, that's really scary, right? Because if you revert back, there's a lot of left tail risk, and you could lose a lot of money. I mean, in some of these cases, it's oh, boy, if that left tail risk plays out, I'm still net cash. And, you know, either debt will go down by a lot. So it's, it's the cleaning of the balance sheet is another reason why this trade doesn't make a ton of them.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> My only worry here across all these commodities, and this is actually the same worry I had at the beginning of the year, so everyone can take with a huge grain of salt. But like, my worry right now is a year ago, if you and I had pitched a commodity company, we would have just been laughed out, right? Like everybody would said, "Hey, let's go buy some stacks trading 50% above trust value or something." You know, nobody want to call it companies but right now, in my conversation with investors, most people are talking commodity companies. It just feels I mean, I was in college in 2007. So I can't put it just feels to me what I imagined, like when people were talking oil, super spike, and remember Buffett? Buffett right now is buying oxy. And Buffett back in 2007, bought a lot of ConocoPhillips. And he ended up selling that at a big loss. And it just like everyone to talk about, it feels like they're saying things can't go wrong, these things are so cheap, it does feel a little different, where it feels like everyone's looking at them. And you know, yet these things are trading at one and a half times EBITDA right now, and that is different than four times EBITDA but it just feels like so many bills that you can't lose, you can't lose and you can't lose. The price comes back down to, you know, from 1300 to 500. And all of a sudden, one-half times EBITDA is eight times EBITDA which isn't that crazy expensive? But these are commodity businesses that the DNA is real. And I'm just worried it feels like everybody's looking in this space right now. You know, I don't know any real betas in the space.<br><br><strong>Tim:</strong> I think everybody's looking, there's this great Twitter follow aggressive value that I would recommend everybody follow. He's my Zen Buddha. [inaudible] and he made this point a couple of weeks ago, I forget which stock it was. But you know, there was probably a piece had by Russia, Ukraine, and you know, whatever stock, of course, Niger down 10%. We said, and so, so you stopped seeing this kind of action. It's just proof that you've got a lot of johnny-come-lately money in these names and no true believers. And I think there was a lot of wisdom in that statement. There's not a lot of true believers in the sector yet. There was I hope I don't mess up his name, but I think Eric Mandel Blatt did an interview with Patrick O'Shaughnessy a couple of weeks ago. And he told every single 13 F for I think, what he defined that to 30 or 40 top single managers, hedge fund peers. He pulled all the 13 assets, it was probably December 31st. They had a 20 basis point allocation to energy and material. And, you know, right now in the s&amp;p, I think they're 5% I think they peaked at 17, something like that. But it's that stack that just tells you "Hey, do you think we're getting a little crowded yet?" I mean, until you see that cohort of folks hiring, you know, analysts that cover energy and materials, or pulling teams, from other funds, that sort of thing. I think identity where we're a little hot money crowded, but I really don't think we're anywhere near real money crowded.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Let me ask you one question. I want you to play psychologist for me for a second because I think you and I have reasonably similar views of the investing world. You know, I wish my views leaned more towards commodity than resellers at the start of the year. But, you know, I do worry investors fight the last world, right, like 2020. tech stocks go parabolic because it's the best environment ever for them. Nobody can do anything in person. Everything's online, you know, tech stocks go parabolic, that runs through about mid-2021. And you mentioned the best like the best, right? Every Invest Like the Best episode is a tech founder or a tech investor or something pitching a tech company. So it's done. 21 And then the bottom slowly starts to fall off. And then from November to today, I mean, the bottom fell out quick, right? And now everybody wants to be long commodities. And these commodities are trading they're still very cheap. As you said, I don't know if there's a lot of true believers. There are some we had Josh on the podcast, that's a true believer who's done fantastic in the cycle, right. But, you know, I, I've been thinking to myself, hey, Andrew, why were you looking at things even cable right? Cable 10 times EBITDA, great compound buys back. Why are you looking at those when you could go look at things that are trading at two times EBITDA? and it doesn't even have to be commodities. The really cheap stuff that worked recently, and I'm wondering," Hey, are we leaning too far one way or the other by focusing on cheap stuff now?" Like, Should we be looking at the broken-down girthy stuff, right, like a peloton that trades at a pretty cheap subscription revenue? Or Pinterest? I don't know, we're showing you right now but in the past year, PayPal and Microsoft both tried to buy them for a lot higher than the current stock price. So like, are we fighting the last war by still looking at low multiple stuff, or should we be looking at beaten-down growth or something right now?<br><br><strong>Tim:</strong> So can I tell you where it could get really scary on the upside, which I feel like my, I feel like most conversations I'm having right now are all about the left tail, and nobody's talking about the right tail. So what, what took those COVID and work from home winners, two to 3x, higher than they should have gone? I would argue that it's this cocktail of passive money, the momentum factor always working, and the momentum factor working on growth for about a decade. Right? If you think about which factors did you want to be long, it was momentum, and then grow, then you have this huge wave of passive money accelerating all these seeds. But the most important factor that most true believers always want to be long as momentum, right? Forget about the growth as a secondary factor. So all the themes that we're discussing, discussing now are, I'm sure screaming first decile, short term momentum, but are going to go first decile, long term momentum, momentum before long, and of course, every quant defined long term momentum differently. So I don't see why, you know, this momentum factor plus passive flows, going from nothing to something couldn't potentially accelerate this trade in a way, in the same way, that the work from home winners went further than they should have ever gone. But now we're talking about stocks that started at one time needed to find what is further than they should have gone to four times EBITDA, either to me, again, that's me talking right tail, that's not me talking my base case. But could that happen, given everything that we know about, you know, passive flows and factor investing? 100%. It's not the growth factor that everybody is obsessed with over a 50-year time frame. It's the momentum factor.<br><br>So again, I just throw that out there as one write-down scenario that we could look back in a year. And it wouldn't be shocking that I said that. And it wouldn't be shocking if it played out. And it would take these things way higher than you ever expected. You know, I'm sitting here getting white knuckles because I pitch Arch and wrote off Arch, and it's gone from 80 to, you know, Finland now, probably 145 or something like that. And so I'm doing my typical value investor thing where I think I'm being a pig and blah, blah, blah. And I'm sitting here questioning myself when by the way the fundamentals of frustration since then, met coal, which I thought was a dream was it 400 is now spot 650. And I'm sitting here, "When should I sell it? When should I sell it? Oh my god, is it two and a half times?" What if that thing goes to 5? And once that EBITDA is 50% higher than I was expecting because of what has happened with Russia. These are on the table, right? You know, and that's why. Look, each commodity sub-sectors gonna have its own nuance, right? I mean, met coal right now just happens to be in a crazy shortage. Maybe that's the one that ends up being multi-bagger. You know, but who knows, maybe it's lumber as well. Which is why, which is why I wanted to create this index in the first place. It's just, I want to tell this story is going to be different. There's going to be nuances, but I just want to tell the story.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> I'm just looking and look, I know things change ad the asset base is different and everything but like, just to show that there's not a lot of, kind of, I mean, I think their short term bullishness, but it hasn't ramped yet, like Exxon Mobil. It's trading under $80 per share today, it was trading over $80 per share back in 2018 and oil then was about 60 and oil today is about 100. I know how future curves work and everything, but I'm just saying like these oils are way tighter, oil prices are way higher right now. I think the share counts lower cuz I'm pretty sure they bought back stock in the meantime, I don't know, I know they did a lot of funky things. But you look at the long-term charts of these, and I get the commodity prices really high now. But the share price is for a lot of these guys. It's not crazy again, it's still even after big runs, a lot of them are still one or two times EBITDA. Cool. Well, Tim, this is great. Anything else you wanna chat before we wrap this up?<br><br><strong>Tim:</strong> No, I just want to thank you again, because you know, when I first came on and did your podcast, I was a total unknown and you made this joke to me, I think offline, but you said, "Oh, you're going to get obsessed with Twitter, you'll get a bunch of followers because of my show," and that sort of thing. The amount of positive feedback that I've received, in terms of people willing to help you think through stock or a theme or a trend because I was on your show, or I'd published something that sort of thing has just blown me away in ways that I could have never predicted. So you were exactly right. You took a chance on interviewing kind of a random on Twitter that had like 200 followers, so I really appreciate it.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Hey, that really warms my heart. I'm so glad to hear that and you know what? It's worth it because I invested an amp yet $3 per share and a lot of that was because you were there holding my hand. So, Tim, I really appreciate it. Tim Weber, the founder of the Double Dog index. He's back on the show for the second time. I'm hoping we can have one for the third time for would it be the Triple Dog index? I'm gonna think of something that has two T's in it, but Tim, thanks for coming on, and looking forward to chatting soon. <br><br><strong>Tim:</strong> Thanks a lot, Andrew--<br><br>[END]</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[February / March 2022 premium update]]></title><description><![CDATA[Before we get to the updates- first, thank you so much for subscribing to the premium site!

Hello and welcome to another value podcast. I am your host, Andrew Walker and with me today, I am excited to have for the second time my friend, Chris Colvin. Chris is a portfolio manager and the Founder of Breach Inlet Capital. Chris, how is it going? <br><br><strong>Chris Colvin:</strong> Great. Great. I really appreciate you having me again. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Hey, I appreciate you coming back on. And I'll talk about that why in a second. But first, let's start this podcast the way I do every podcast. First with a quick disclaimer for everyone. Nothing on this podcast is investing advice. Please do your own work. Consult your own financial advisor. Just keep all of that in mind.<br><br>And then second, with a pitch for you, my guest is going back, time flies. You were one of the first ten or fifteen guests on the podcast back in November 2020. People can go listen to that for the full pitch. But you are a super sharp small-cap investor. The last idea you pitched, I thought it was so eventy. I thought it was so good, and it worked out really well. And people should go listen to that. That was Great Canada- Great Canadian Gaming. That worked out well. And I am seeing a lot of parallels to the idea we are going to talk about today. <br><br>So with that out of the way, the stuff we are going to talk about today is HMHC. I know you've got a long history with it. There's an acquisition offer out there which I think is too cheap. I know you think it is too cheap. But I'll just turn it over to you. What's going on with HMHC? <br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, sure. Thanks again for having me. And hopefully, this has a similar outcome or better than Great Canadian did. And disclaimer, as you said, "Do your own research". My firm does have a position in HMHC and I would also say we are not looking to form a group with any investors. <br><br>So HMHC, it is been around since the 1800s. They became public in the 1960s and then went private again in 2001. And they were owned by a couple of private strategics between '01 and '13 before they became public again. So given that background, this thing has definitely been bought out before and owned by both private equity and strategic. We got involved and I should say first, I looked at this in 2015, around the time I was launching my fund. And I passed on it because the prior CEO had a very unclear long-term strategy, and profits were declining pretty precipitously. So I passed on it, put it in my file or watch list file, and said, "Hey if the CEO changes and they kind of change the strategy. There are some good things about this business". <br><br>And we got officially involved, took a stake early last year when it was around 5, 6 bucks a share. And our thesis was transforming from good to great business. So you had a business with a 30% market share in an oligopoly. There are effectively 3 players that have an 80% share. So, they are the largest. And that was in the core curriculum for K through 12 schools. So great market share in their moat. The primary moat they had was their brand. As they say, in this case, "You do not get fired at a school for picking Houghton Mifflin's books". So that was a very sticky moat from a 100-year-plus brand.<br><br>So, that was why it was a good business. And we believe it is transforming from a great business, or into a great business because they sold, or are in the process of selling their non-core consumer books business, and that has since been completed. But at that time, it was up for sale. So that was part of our thesis. And with that, they were transitioning to more recurring revenue, as books are now, instead of being a hard textbook that you and I had in school, switching to an iPad and software program. <br><br>So, switching to more recurring revenue. They were cutting a bunch of costs. They have a lower cost structure and make it far less capital intensive so that growth, consistency, and cash flow profile were becoming far more attractive. So, good to great business. <br><br>Then you had some unique tailwinds. One was school is reopening. Secondly, you had government stimulus which ended up being, I think 200 billion dollars is allocated for K through 12. And COVID accelerated this concept of one device for each student. Before COVID, on average you had one device for every 2 students. And that has really become one-to-one as obviously kids were homeschooled. So you have these nice tailwinds that would help them and their transformation, and accelerate earnings growth and recovery. <br><br>And the third element of our thesis was an experienced CEO, Jack Lynch, who had transformed or founded 5 different companies in the ed-tech space. This was, I guess, his fifth, so he had a lot of experience and success. <br><br>And then lastly, it was [inaudible]. On the math, we were doing normalized earnings. It was trading, at that point, sub-five times. And that normalized earnings ended up being very conservative given they continue to cut costs and a rebound in billing. So, that was the reason that we initially invested. Obviously, it worked out well this first year of ownership. But we were looking forward to owning it many years from here. We had, I think, a $40 price target, looking out eighteen to twenty-four months. <br><br>And I actually had lunch with the CEOs live in Charleston part-time. So, I had lunch with them, actually 3 days before that Bloomberg article came out. And from that lunch, I took away that this is going to be looking to create long-term value for shareholders, and thinks that stock is cheap. It was about fifteen or sixteen bucks then. <br><br>After that lunch, we saw the Bloomberg News stating that they were looking at getting acquired, or that private equity suitors were approaching. We sent a private letter to the board stating we are not going to tender or vote yes if it is less than $30 a share. Because again, we thought fair value looking on a few years was forty. And obviously, ultimately, they announced that Veritas would be, it is trying to acquire them for $21 per share through a tender structure. And we wrote a public letter outlining the reasons we do not support that. Why we would not tender our shares.<br><br>Since that letter, 3 other shareholders have written public letters. And I know of others that have considered this or are certainly not happy with this. Since our letter, the tender doc came out. So, I am happy to walk through the 4, 5 reasons we are against the tender but that is some background.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Let's see that in a second, but let's just pause it. That was a fantastic overview. But if I was just to summarize it, you invested this in early 2021, did well with it. It is done well. But right now, the situation is this company is under a merger contract. There's a tender offer outstanding to buy out the whole company at $21 per share. You and-- I know Laughing Water and Engine have both publicly come out with a letter. I do not know who the other one is. <br><br>I've heard from several shareholders. One of my friends, Jonathan, has been pushing me for years to look at this company since I've got text messages from him when it was at $3 per share, and I've just had trouble looking. But he was like, "I am so happy having Chris on. This is way too cheap." Veritas is still in the company. I know there are other shareholders out there who think this is too cheap. But that is the overall situation right now, right? $21-per-share offer on the table. You and some other shareholders are pushing back, "This is too cheap", "We either need to stay public", or "This offer needs to get raised a lot higher". Is that a fair characterization? <br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Yes. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Great.<br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> And I think that is one of the reasons we are against it. As has been outlined in the letter since ours, I think, there is a much better path for all shareholders. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> I am going to let you go through that path in a second but I just want to agree with one thing. You mention you had lunch with the CEO 3 days before the rumors broke. Obviously, I didn't have lunch but, as I was prepping for this podcast, I think it was a Goldman conference at the very start of January. And I put in my notes, I put in my Twitter thing for people to go see. He sounded so bullish. He was talking about how great 2022 growth was going to be, all the recurring revenues, how the business was firing on all cylinders. I couldn't believe that he would say that 2 months, 2 weeks before they would get into deep sales talk to sell the business at a fine premium, but it is still like, 9 times EBITDA. It is nothing great for all the growth and how well he was talking about the business doing.<br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, I agree with you. Disregarding back my lunch because I am not going to quote exactly but overall the summary from the lunch was focused on creating long-term value. I think there is a lot of opportunities, and think we are really cheap. And I specifically asked about private equity taking him out that was one of my concerns. And I said if they bring an offer above fair value or at fair value, that would bring that to the board. And obviously, we have different views of what fair value is and we can get into that. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> So, why do not we just start with that. Twenty-one dollars per share, your letter which it is going to be included in the show notes. I had a link to it on Twitter. We'll include it in the show notes so people can go read up on it fully. But why do not you just walk through, why $21 per share isn't fair? Because I think the company would say, "Hey, we ran a full process. You can go read the tender docs. We reached out to a lot of people. There's Party A, there are strategics, there are financial people". I think it was like, fifty or sixty people in total. We ran a full process. Veritas came out with the highest bid. It was a 35% plus premium to the unaffected share price. If you are going to turn this down, you are basically saying all these financial strategic buyers were completely wrong that this was a full and fair process that we ran. Who are you to push back on this?".<br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah. I think the first thing is, the process. And this is something that wasn't in our letter because the tender document had not come out that disclosed the process, or this would have been at the top of our letter. <br><br>We believe this was a flawed process. Number one, if you look at the timing. So they started the first meeting to discuss strategic alternatives was in June of last year. They would have just reported trough billings. Their billings at that point were $400 million annualized. For perspective, in a normal environment, they should be doing 1.2 to 1.4 billion. Why would you consider strategic alternatives when you are just coming off of trough billings, trough earnings. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> It reminds me of our last podcast, it was Great Canadian who sold themselves right before the vaccine came out, right?<br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Similar. Right.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Literally, right before casinos could fully reopen they sold themselves. It is similar in that way but please continue.<br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Yup, definitely. Definitely parallels. And then, that is the beginning of the process, the end of the process, the timing. I also struggle with it because they announced the deal 2 days before fourth-quarter earnings were due. And not only were those earnings ultimately very strong that we'll get into but they would have typically offered 2022 guidance. And I would make the argument if you just look at our fourth-quarter earnings, as you said earlier, it implies they are buying this for 9 times. McGraw-Hill was bought for just over 9 times, and that is, I would argue, not as good of a business. So on trailing, had they not announced this process, I truly believe, had they not announced the tendering process that this would be a $20-plus stock today. Because if you put a little premium to McGraw-Hill on trailing earnings, talking about times like, you are talking about a twenty-four, twenty-five dollar stock. <br><br>So, number one was the timing on the process. Secondly, I think I saw also in some of your tweets is the initial forecast was completely sandbagged. And that forecast came out in November after announcing third-quarter earnings. And that is what the initial bids were based on. So, they contacted sixty parties, and ultimately fifty-eight of those were gone before the revised forecast. So, this initial forecast, to be specific, said that 2021 EBITDA would be 190 million. Trailing EBITDA at that point, trailing twelve months was two-forty. <br><br>So, bidders looked at this forecast and said, "Wow, there is going to be a huge drop in earnings in the fourth quarter of '21, and then in '22, you are guiding to two-seventy. So now, there is going to be this hockey stick". I think any bidder, private equity firm that is looking at tons of deals every week quickly looks at that forecast and says, "Something does not smell right here and we'll pass", which is what you saw most do. Now, I do not know that but to me, that initial forecast was certainly sandbagged, and I feel confident in saying that. They ultimately reported their '22 guidance, '22 forecast, $270 million of EBITDA. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> If I can just pile on here, the initial forecast, which is done in November. So, there are six weeks left in the year, a hundred ninety-six in EBITDA for 2021, two-hundred seventy million in EBITDA for 2022. Then, January comes out, bids are almost due and they have to be revised. 2021 EBITDA comes in at two-seventy, as you said. They did 2022 in 2021. They were off by 40% on their 2021 projections in six weeks, and then they update their 2022 EBITDA from 272 to 286, 2023 EBITDA goes from 308 to 350. These are massive moves, especially for a business which I think we'll probably talk about this in a second. A digital recurring revenue subscription business that should have insane amounts of operating leverage, right? So, when your EBITDA goes from 270 to 300 or whatever, all of that is going to come through to the bottom line.<br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah. I think it is important to point out, the initial forecast came out in November, right? I think early mid-November. I think, November 6 or something. So that is the six weeks you referenced. But initial bids were due December 15th. How in the world did the board not go to bidders and say, "You know what, this initial forecast is way low". Two weeks left in the year, you got to have a good sense that you are going to be way above a hundred and ninety million of EBITDA or a hundred and ninety-six million. So, yeah, sandbagged the initial forecast. <br><br>And then, to your point on the revised forecast. So, that came out in January. And at that point, there were only 2 of the 60 bidders remaining. And one of those not disclosed, I think it was Party B may be in the document.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> It is.<br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> But they ultimately passed because I think, they had their own kind of, it was either integration or financing or funding issues. So, you are left with one real bidder, Veritas. And let's talk about that forecast real quick. The operating leverage for '22 is negative. And the operating leverage after '22 was low to mid-30s, and they have publicly touted 65% incremental margins for a year plus.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> I've got this in my notes but they are literally in their investor deck. I put the tweet. They've got a slide that says 65% of incremental billings flow through to free cash flow average not 65% of EBITDA, 65% of incremental billing. This is a business with insane operating leverage. And as you are saying, their forecasts are calling for almost D operating leverage as they grow. <br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, D operating in '22, and then about half that. And I am comparing apples to apples. They actually give if you dig deeper, the tender doc gives you their free cash flow projections. It is not on the table but then it is later. And when you do the math, it is thirty-three or thirty-four percent incremental margins. What happened to the 65% margins that not only have you been guiding to, but they actually had been achieving thus far in the recovery since they had reduced the cost structure. So yeah, the revised forecast I think the other thing that was concerning a couple of other elements and just the process itself.<br><br>So February 17th, Veritas submitted the $20 bid. That was their revised bid based on the revised forecast. The board goes back on February 18th and says, "No, you got to submit $21 a share."<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yep. <br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> They agreed to twenty-one that day. If you read the tender doc, February 18th, and the board that does not say, "You have to agree today or this is going away." I mean, they had no other bidders at that point because it was based on this revised forecast. But I thought that was interesting but the board asked for one dollar more. Veritas said, "Sure, yeah that sounds great. Yeah, we'll do that." I think that was interesting. Also, a couple of other things I didn't like...<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> ...I would just say to be a fair and balanced neutral part, I do not disagree. It is quick to turn it around but I do think Veritas is an experienced private equity bidder. I have seen in past docs where a board comes back and says, "Hey, 20 is enough. We need 21". And the bidders can respond pretty quickly because they know where their bottom line is. So, I had to 100% disagree with you but just to be kind of a little bit fair and balanced there. <br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah. No, it does not surprise me. They responded right away and yeah, I hear you, but I do think it is just maybe a little nugget that wasn't how much more to ask order. And then, of course, the structure. When we talk about the process instead of a vote it is a tender. And that is crucial, that is a huge negative for us as shareholders. And I thought it was laughable that in the tender doc when they listed the reasons you should agree to this merger because they had, "Here are the positives", "Here's the negatives." Listed under positives was, "This is a tender". That is not a positive as a shareholder. <br><br>And I am going to have a quick public service announcement here. ISS and Glass Lewis need to start making recommendations on tenders because I think you are going to see more tenders happen. And in the world where passive shareholders, the Vanguards, the BlackRock, the World, own over 50% shares which is all you need in the tender. They ultimately base it on proxy recommendations. There is no proxy recommendation. And I think they have to change that, and provide a recommendation on this because it is effectively the same as a vote. You're just voting with the tender. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> That's really interesting because the classic merger over bank-driven thing is, tender offers are the best because they happen really fast, right? You get your money. There are less chances of a deal falling through. There are less chances of something going crazy. When the tender offer happens, all the financing is going to be super fast. But that is interesting. It is a way to, kind of, get around, "Hey, maybe this was a flawed process. Hey, maybe somebody" There's something in there that ISS and Glass Lewis wouldn't do, and you can do this really quickly before anybody really pays it. That's a really interesting comment.<br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah. And the last thing, I'd say, just on the process, is conflicts of interest. So we saw this in Great Canadian, too. Actually, if I remember right, Evercore was the advisor to HMHC. They also provided the Fairness Opinion. I know we are seeing this and seeing it more often. I remember when I was in banking if I recall, you always had a different bank which makes sense to do the fairness opinion. There's a huge conflict there. Yes, we should certainly get this deal done so when we get our banker fee. In that fairness opinion, used first-quarter estimated net debt, 3 million. Their year-end net cash was, like, a hundred and twenty million. So, you are talking about a dollar per share value that leaks just by saying, "You know what, we are going to base this on an estimated March 31st, instead of using the actual balance sheet at twelve thirty-one. And my guess is that March 31st was based off again on a very low forecast. They do not give you the details to get there.<br><br>And the last thing on conflicts of interest is two other things, the fairness opinion...<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> ...Can I add one thing on Evercore? One person, when they heard you were coming out to talk on HMHC, they said, "Hey, I am really pissed that Evercore worked with HMHC on this because Evercore, apparently, does a lot of banking for Veritas on the other side. And they said. not to accuse a banker of feeding, of working with but they said, they think Veritas has a lot of work with Evercore, and maybe that had Evercore put their thumb on the scale a little bit there, too. So I do not want to accuse them of everything. That's an unconjectured rumor. People are saying that type of stuff but... <br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> ...Actually, on the conflict of interest on the Fairness Opinion, they didn't actually name the transaction comps. At least I didn't see it. That's fairly uncommon to not even list what transaction comps they are using. But, fine.<br><br>But the last thing I was going to say on conflicts of interest, and again, like you said, not accusing anyone of anything, these are just facts that the tender doc discloses that Veritas paid Evercore $75 million over the last 24 months. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Well, that must be where my friend got it from. I didn't realize it was the source. But that is why people are saying it, right? Like Veritas clearly works with them. And it is strange to have the private equity firm pay them so much, and then have them advise the target, very strange stuff.<br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> And the gain give a Fairness Opinion. So, those are just facts. They were banker, Fairness Opinion, received 75 million. Take those facts and form your own opinions, right? So, go ahead.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Speaking of conflicts of interest, that is great. I do want to talk about it. So, bankers can be conflicted. Obviously, private equity would love to buy every business for a song, right? But I want to come back to the management team and the board of directors, right? Like it seems strange to me that a management team in November would put together a forecast that was so off on the EBITDA forecast. <br><br>And then in December, when the process started, if I was the board, I would be like, "Holy crap, our EBITDA's going to be that much higher? We're gushing cash for, maybe we need to pause and evaluate. Look, earnings are 40% percent higher. Our business is 40% more valuable. We need to rethink everything, right? It seems a very strange time to go and sell the company." <br><br>So, I want to talk about, maybe conflicts of interest from the management and board point. Why do you think that they are recommending a sale right now? Why do you think they did not? Obviously, a lot of shareholders piss at this. Why would they go with a quick sale and not re-evaluate, maybe think about staying public, maybe asking for a higher price, all that type of stuff?<br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, it is a great question and I do not have the answer to that. I think it is the question that we are all asking. What I can point to is the board owns, I believe .3%. If you remove Jack Lynch, they own .3% of the shares.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yep. <br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Now, part of our assessment when we look at a potential portfolio company is, what is the experience, which I touched on. Jack has great experience in the alignment of incentives. And Jack himself had good alignment. Now, I do not know. The tender doc says that there have been no employment contracts executed. I would find it very hard to believe that Jack is not staying on. And I think, unless you know what that employment contract looks like, it is kind of tough. I think it is just speculation. And I do not want to speculate on maybe, for all I know, Jack is retiring. But I suspect he is staying on. There's probably a nice incentive package there. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> I do not want to speculate. But I will say, as you said, insider ownership here is very low. Jack owns, I think it is 400,000 shares of stock and another 600,000 sort of stock options. So on a $20 stock, that is not "nothing". But it is not huge, right? So I could imagine a world Autozone[?], sorry, Academy Sports is a company I've been looking at a lot recently. And they have a fantastic CEO. And what happened was private equity bought a business. They were having trouble and they got a fantastic CEO by saying, "Hey, we are going to give you stock options to buy a ton of this company on the cheap. It is very levered. It is just a little bit stressed right now. If you can make this work, you are going to make tens of millions of dollars."<br><br>And I could imagine, yeah there is no agreement between Jack and Veritas, but he knows himself. "I am the best person to run this business. If this goes private, they put some leverage on it. I can get some stock options and if I keep executing, I can really juice this thing." So, that would be my conjecture. I do not know if you want to add anything to that. <br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, because we do not know if Jack is staying on an employment agreement. We're speculating, I think, when you ask any shareholder that. When you ask me, "Why would the board agree to this?", I can just turn to exclude Jack. That group of board members owns very little stock, number one. And then two, I would want to know what the post comp is. And I think one of the letters written out there suggested giving Jack more comp. And I would be on board with that as well. I think he is done a great job running the business.<br><br>If we need to pay him based on if you hit these targets, this stock gets to 30, 40 dollars, as long as it does not get to where the compensation, obviously, is not truly hurting the shareholders. I think you could create a nice alignment there. So, we can talk about the better path, and I think that should include going to Jack and saying, "Hey, not sure what you had with Veritas but here's a deal staying public where you can make a lot of money if you create shareholder value". And that was what one of the letters actually a friend of mine, Persad [?], wrote on his own. We've known each other for years, been in similar situations, own the same companies, think similarly. And that is what he put in his letter which I thought was a really good idea.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> This is the charter, even Tesla did it, right? You give the CEO and you say, "Hey, we are going to put some aggressive share price targets out there. But if you hit them, you are going to make multiples and multiples of money" Right? Give him, "Hey, a hundred thousand shares, stocks at twenty. Hundred thousand shares vested, thirty. Hundred fifty thousand shares vested, forty. Two hundred thousand shares vested, fifty, and you've got to hit those in 5 to 7 years. And if you hit them, you are going to get really rich but shareholders are going to be super happy, right? You doubled the company. And it really aligns interests well, and I am with you". Because he joined this company in 2017. I think, he is done a really solid job. And honestly, he is probably been underpaid for how good of a job he is done in selling the non-core divisions, getting this business on the right track. <br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah. I agree with you. I think he is done a phenomenal job and would be happy to pay him much more and align it with a higher share price. And I think there is a scenario where he could be more attracted than, maybe, what he'd get as a private company. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Well, All I ask you first. Is anything else on the process that you want to talk about here? <br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> No, I think, there is little but no. I think that is the big piece. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Let me ask you a qualitative question. One of the things I was surprised by, so again, I am not an expert on this company. I followed them tangentially for a while. I brush upon them for the podcast, obviously. But one thing I was surprised by was, the CEO says, "Hey, we have got a significant barrier to entry for new companies." Thirty percent market share, as you said, pretty sticky business, salesforce. You're not going to be a startup company and come, and be able to just sell to Grade K on reading or something, right? Like there are real benefits to scale and salesforce and everything. And if you can do that often the best thing is, just go sell yourself to HMHC and they'll plug you into their huge distribution port. So, there is a barrier to entry there. <br><br>I was a little surprised, they have not done much bolt-on M&amp;A, and stuff. I do not think they bought a business in the past 5 years or something. So my 2 questions there were, "Am I missing something?", "Is it strange that they have not done them M&amp;A, or there is just a lack of opportunity?". And then, part two of the question was, "Do you think Veritas is looking at this company and saying, 'Oh, great. This is a leopard roll-up story'". Right? Like we buy them, take them private and we accelerate their growth by going to do a bunch of accretive bolt-on acquisitions. <br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, great question. So, in the first part of that question, they have not done M&amp;A, and I think it is because they have really been focused on transforming the core business itself. So often, non-consumer businesses get the cost structure low, transition to more digital, and they had started to, so, if you think about the K through 12 markets there is the core piece which there is basically 3 big players, them, McGraw-Hill, and Savvas, which was part of Pearson. <br><br>And then you have, what I would call an in-core. Think of your reading math, sciences, that everyone's got to take, K through 12. Then, they have the extensions and supplemental market. And the easy way to describe that is to think of materials for students that are either behind the curve are ahead of the curve. And that is a business where they have like 10% share. <br><br>Part of their strategy was growing that share, and that was going to come through two avenues. One was going to their schools, their customers, and saying, "Look, we already served this core material. Now, we have created our own products and extensions. We think we can offer more here", and try to get their share and extensions up to core which is why all of us keep referencing normalized billings. I think the reality is, it is going to be much higher than normalized billings, materially higher because I do think they'll gain share. <br><br>The other part of gaining shares, so there is an organic piece coming up with their own products, and selling based on they have the best platform because then, they can serve everything. The second piece and they have actually been pretty vocal recently about, is the opportunity to acquire smaller startups that have great products but do not have the scale to get into the doors of the schools and to go sell this thing nationwide. So that was a key part of this strategy going forward. <br><br>When you look at some of the materials out there, it was focused on making sure of organic growth and we got the business going in the right direction. Then, it is M&amp;A and then it is a return of capital. So, I had not seen it yet because they had to get the transformation done, and obviously, COVID impacted that in some ways, accelerated the transformation but probably took some more work. That was a major, kind of, setback from a bonus[?] perspective but that was definitely for the opportunity. And if you think about Veritas, they bought Cambium Learning. I think it was in 2018 if I recall, which is in the space. I believe they also bought the K through 12 business from Lexus if I am remembering right. So, they bought Lexus, and then they are keeping the K through 12-piece of that. So, they are already starting a roll-up here. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> I had forgotten about that about Veritas. So, obviously, they have got expertise in the space. Do you know if Veritas, I do not think they said it in the press release or anything? Do you think they are planning to merge this with the other businesses they have, or are they going to run this as a standalone and just be like, "We have got lots of place on the ed-tech space?"<br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> I do not know, of course. But I would suspect I do not see why they would not ultimately merge these entities. I mean, the cost-saving, the cost synergies, there has to be some. And then second, I think there should be probably some revenue synergies. That would be my guess. I think what HMHC has stated publicly as part of the tender they released is the materials that the employees get. And in those materials, they imply or directly state that it would be standalone. But I would suspect that down the road, they are going to merge these entities. <br><br>And is one letter pointed out, if you read these materials, they say, "Look, this merger is happening". They're just customary closing conditions. And that is one of the things I think that is been pressuring from a shareholder perspective. This is not a done deal. Ultimately, the board does not control the company. It is also being down to the shareholders. And I think the employees, they own shares, and so it is unfair to not make clear to them that, "Hey, you've got it right here. It is not a vote. We have a right to tender or not. And oh, by the way, we plan to stay as a standalone entity. But the company buying us has acquired 2 other companies in the space in the last thirty-six months".<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> I am completely with you there though at the same time I feel for, like, It is a tender offer, right? What do you say other than it is subject to customary closing conditions and stuff? My shadows are getting crazier. But no, I am completely with you there. <br><br>Let me ask you. Okay, so we have got the $21-per-share offer on the table, right? And from here, there are 2 paths shareholders can... Hopefully, shareholders get together and if everyone agrees, if shareholders think this is undervalued, shareholders do not tender. And then either Veritas can bump their bid, or Veritas walks away and HMHC is a stand-alone, publicly-traded company and we can go from there. <br><br>So, I want to walk down both paths. Let us start with path number 2. Say, the tender offer fails and Veritas walks away, I think you argued $40 per share in value, what would you like to see for that values can realize. Engine proposed, "Do a big tender offer right now to buy back a ton of shares at twenty-one or twenty-two, move on from this, and then go forward as a standalone". Would you like to see that? Would you like to see them really lean into inorganic growth? What would you like to see as a standalone if this deal falls through?<br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, good question, and I think it is worth touching on, and valuation. If you take the low end of their normalized billings and imply like a dollar and seventy-five or free cash flow, put a market multiple which I call six and a half times. I think this is better than the average public business especially as its transformation continues. But I get you to like $29 a share. If you take the mid-cycle billings, that gets you to 2 over 250 per share, free cash flow, apply mark multiple, and that is how you get a $40 stock, which is what we were getting when you look out a few years. And I think you will see multiple expansions, SAS peers, trade for seven and a half times revenue, which implies is a $7 stock. <br><br>And again, I am not saying it should be seventy today but that just kind of shows you the potential upside and expansion plus you have an NOL that is<br>worth about two dollars per share and net cash, balance sheet, and those are things that, the NOL we are not getting paid for and that is a future upside. And of course, I think there are going to be big synergies. <br><br>We talked about but it is also worth noting when the CFO was hired back in. I think it was sixteen. It was a twenty-dollar stock back then so there hasn't been truly any shareholder value created since he joined. And that just shows you. This isn't like they bought some huge premium and it is never been here. <br><br>Let us say much better business today than it was not 2016 when I was a twenty-dollar stock and also cheaper on an Enterprise Value basis because of net cash versus a lot of debt but I think the better path. I agree with what some of the other shareholders have written on a high level. I think if it were totally my decision. What I honestly if they are tossed walks away who I hope they walk away if they are not willing to pay materially more than I would go lever. The company two times on last year's EBITDA which should end up being sub 2 times on this year's EBITDA. You could go buybacks 20% of the shares in today's share price. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yep.<br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> And that would convert to a stock that is doing on low in a building over two hours for sure cash flow on bid cycle billings over three dollars a share, put a mark in multiple. You're talking about thirty-five to [inaudible], five-dollar stock and that should still give you. So you do 2 times the leverage on last year's EBITDA ultimately, less than that on the forward EBITDA and it is things generating cash. So you should be able to also have the capital to go do some MMA because I think that is an opportunity to expand their extensions and supplemental product portfolio, and really increase their market share there. So, I think it is both of those scenarios. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> And I think the only other thing I would add again when I was reading the conference from the beginning of January going to the decks and stuff. This is a business. The revenue retention is off the charts. It is going to print cash flow. There are tons of operating leverage like this is a business. This is why private equity loves these businesses. It is a business that can support a lot of debt because it should be non-cyclical with selling into schools, non-cyclical, very steady with that revenue retention like two times EBITDA, two times leverage is not crazy on that type of business especially the leverage is going to come down really quickly because of both the cash flow generation and the growth. So I am with you.<br><br>So as a standalone business, what you would like to see, is kind of what I'll call the engine model, right? Hopefully, Veritas walks, buys back a bunch of shares at the Veritas price. So the arbs and everyone who was in it for the arb[?], can get the heck out. It is going to be at a creative price and the remaining shareholders who believe are going to own more of the company and hopefully, the company grows and it is going to prove to be very cheap. So that is one route. I am with you there. <br><br>Let's talk about the second route, we get into, I think the tender expires at the beginning of April. We get to the tender offer date and Veritas sees, "Hey, we do not have the shares to close this deal. We need to bump to get some of the crest or the engines." Or the other shareholders to have said, "We are not tender into this price. It is way too cheap." So they are talking about a bump, you have said, I think you said on a market multiple this business would be about twenty-nine or thirty. I think engine throughout a forty dollar per share price of the company. What price do you start saying? All right, burn in the hand worth more than two in the bush. What price are you saying? All right. I am going to tender my shares into this.<br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, before I answer that I should clarify that first scenario. They stay public. I was talking about two times gross leverage. They would still have a hundred and right now, 135 million dollars of cash flow reports. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Great one, great. <br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Yes, so net leverage we are talking like one and a half going much, much lower. So in that scenario, you have the ability to buy back stock plus plenty of cash to go. Do your roll-up of smaller companies and you made a great point that I should have stayed. And also, you could pay $22 to share. So the folks that want to tender twenty-one. Well, now you can get a dollar higher in those like me that want to stick around and see a longer-term opportunity. So it is a win-win for everybody but in the scenario where...<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> ...I would just say, I am a little greedier than you. I would say you offer twenty-one, so the arbs get their twenty-one, and then everybody else saved the dollar and can get a little higher but I am with you there.<br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, so to your question of what price would I accept? We said in our letter that we thought it should be $29 of share. Honestly, our letter was a little more conservative because I told you our private letter said $30 a share.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> And it was before the projections and the tender docks, and everything came out. So you were writing as ice called in the fog of war. There is new information that is going on some time. <br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah and if you take her twenty-nine plus $2 of NOL value. That's thirty-one said differently, take our twenty-nine plus the fact that there is going to be, I think some synergies. So think about that and secondly that scenario where I told you we buyback to 20% of the shares. Just levering, it gross two times that gets you easily to $35 stock. I think pretty quickly north of thirty. So I would like to see $30. That's where I am going to tender my shares. If they came out tomorrow and said twenty-eight, I would still not be tendering my shares which someone could say, "Well, that is crazy" but that only sounds crazy because you are anchoring it to this very low, $21. <br><br>If you look at their trailing EBITDA, apply a slight premium to McGraw-Hill's buyouts which to be clear, I think is a better business, McGraw-Hill has a lot of higher ed-tech exposure which is a much more competitive market and they have very little share in the K through 12 extensions and supplemental. So if you take McGraw-Hill, apply a one-term, one-half term premium on trailing EBITDA. You get to a low to mid-twenties and obviously, we are not near normalized billings from what the company is publicly stated that does not include the benefits of a tender and everything. So, $30 would be if I owned 100% of the company and you were Veritas and said, "What do I have to pay you?" It would be thirty dollars this year.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yeah. No, look. I do not disagree with you but I think if they bump this to twenty-six to twenty-eight dollars per share, I think ultimately they are able to get this done. There would be some shareholders who weren't crazy-happy. But again, it comes down to burden in the end. <br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> I agree with you. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yeah, yeah.<br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> I do agree with you. We have owned companies for over 5 years. So we are probably a little bit more of a longer-term holder than I think. Maybe a lot of public money... <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> ...Then May[?] who started ramping up on this a week ago and he is over here opining[?] like he is an expert. <br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, but no, yeah. So I agree with you. I think if they, especially at the high-end of that, but I think twenty-one, you know, you have a bunch of passive investors and something I would say, obviously, every shareholder means to make their own decision. But I think for those that say, "Well this is going to pass" Because there are all these passive investors and ISS is not going to give a recommendation and I do not want to take the PNL hit. I will again point out that I think this could there will not be much. I could be wrong but you will see event-driven guys sell this deal ends and Veritas walks away. But on a valuation fundamental basis, I think twenty-one is cheap on today's numbers. And so I am willing to say, "Look, I am willing to take the risk, they walk away." I hope they do because I think there is a lot more upside. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yeah. Look, I mean, this is a business that is growing mid to high single digits, great revenue retention, huge operating leverage as we have talked about, a great cash flow, not economically sensitive. If I told you about that business and we just blanked it out. Nobody would think that is a nine times EBITDA, ten times free cash flow business, right? You'd be saying, "Oh, this is a 12, 13, 14 times EBITDA business", maybe higher as you said with the market multiples thing. So I do not want to people to anchor on that. I think the most important thing you can correct me wrong. I've talked to a lot of shareholders now, maybe because of the passive flows and our dynamics and everything, a little. But I think there are a lot of shareholders who are with you. Like, if this price is under twenty-five, I think there are a lot of shareholders you just say, "Hey, I'd rather the company lever up, buyback shares", to get the arms out, to shrink the share account, and then keep growing because I think it is going to spit off a lot of cash flow. And I think we could be looking at $40 in eighteen months, especially with the chair repurchase dynamic. <br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, I would say, I heard from a lot of shareholders after I wrote my letter. Obviously, since I am not forming a group to not engage with those shareholders. But I have got a lot of feedback. I do not know of one shareholder, active shareholder that thinks $21 is near fair value. I mean, how often do you see? Four separate managers come out and write public letters and we are not an activist. We've written some letters but that is not our strategy. So I think that is important. The thing I left off when shareholders consider, should they tender or not? I said, "I think we truly have downside protection based on the trailing earnings power." But probably arguably, more importantly, I do not want to speak for them. But engine publicly came out and said, "Look, we want to nominate directors and pursue this tender offer or buyback path as soon as possible." So, I do not think shareholders will be left with what do we do now. And although we are frustrated that CEO and board presumably have accepted this tender. We still you know, would love and are willing to give, Jack would love to give him a compensation package that pays him for that upside. I do not think there is anyway. <br><br>I think it is a little different Great Canadian where I think it is shareholders were done with the CEO who actually ended up that was kind of a funny story, ended up getting fired because of, did you ever kind of tangent here, but.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> I remember a little bit of why the CEO got fired. At this point, COVID time flies so I can't. But I do remember, was it right before or right after the deal closed? But yeah, I remember that be. <br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, I forget the specifics. But in this case...<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> ...I do not think it was pretty, is how it would put a kind. <br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah. Something about invading some vax like going to get vaccine somewhere, he should know. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> That was it. Yeah, he said he was a hospitality worker and he drove like a hundred miles from their headquarters and was like, "Oh, yeah. I am a frontline worker. I need to be boosted to the front of the line for the vaccine." Allegedly, he said all this and it came out in the board had to fire him because of that. That was it. <br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, and that is an area. I think Cheryl's were frustrating were in this scenario. I think we are all economic piece and I think we look at and say, "Look, he is done a great job, Jack. We would happily love to have them continue to run the company, give them a bigger conversation package, and you've got this engine who's got a great track record." And again, I can't speak for them. I do not know what they would ultimately do, but they have at least publicly said, "Hey, we would like to nominate board members and execute this buyback plan."<br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> What I would love to see here is, I love to see the tender offer fail or they can boost it to thirty. I'll take thirty, right? But the tender offer fails and then in the next proxy, it comes out. The engine has put someone on the board who has a 6% ownership stake in the company. So you've got it a big shareholder involved and then Jack gets, as I call it the charter treatment, right? If you can get the shares to 30, 40, 50, in the next 5 years, you are going to create huge value. We are going to give you so much money and<br>you are going to be a multi-multi-multi-multimillionaire based on that. <br><br>And then six months later, I would love to start seeing all of the compounder bros start talking about and putting tweets off, "Oh hey HMHC, it is a business that grows." Great operating leverage they are committed to 2x leverage targets that they keep buying back shares the CEOs really incentivize. There's a line board and it is a great business and you see Scuttleblurb come out with a piece talking about how good and sticky the HMHC businesses and stuff are. <br><br>And you know, just like all the people who I really respect that but this becomes the small-cap, compounder bro, ed-tech company. That is what I would love to see because I think this business could do that and would create a lot of value going that path. <br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, and I think there is, of course, there is always execution race operational risk and just macro. But this is a business that it has some lumpiness based on the adoptions calendar but that is becoming a less lumpy but generally less cyclical business. There are some ties you municipalities in their budgets but generally less cyclical. This is not a business that we were talking about before the podcast. You have to worry about, where is consumer spending going to end, right? This is a much more defensive business than that becoming obviously a better business as it goes the more sass. So, I agree with you. That's the hope and I think it is a realistic one if this tender does not happen which I think...<br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> ...Let me ask one more question. I know a big thesis, not the core thesis [inaudible], but I like a cherry on top of the thesis for HMHC had been, Hey, in the wake of COVID. There's all this money that the bill back butter money or whatever that is just going to get flooded into the municipalities into improving education, all this sort of stuff. And HMHC 30% market share as you said, they are going to be a mammoth beneficiary of that. To my two questions, you are. Is that still playing out on the cars on the horizon? And now I am looking at the projections, it is fine growth, but I do not see a wave of federal money. Do you think they understood that in the projections? <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yes, I think the projections undersold from a top-line perspective. Number one, because there is $200 billion of stimulus to K through 12. And, and to be clear. It is not 30% of 200 billion, obviously, because that is going to go to a lot of different pockets.<br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Improving the HVAC, it is nasty and sort of stuff.<br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Right, right. And I think if I remember right, laughing water actually did do some math on. Here's the potential from that and I do not have it on top of my head. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> I think I have seen it that from. Yeah.<br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, which if you think about it we go lever up two times gross which is one and a half or something that, and then we have the surge in billings and cash flow. We can quickly pay that down, right? It makes it even more attractive because you have the stimulus funds coming through the next few years. The other reason that I think the forecast is low, certainly on the bottom line is we talked about incremental margins but on the top line, the normalized billings of a one-two to one-four where they were, historically, that was based on a 10% extensions and supplemental share. And I do believe that Jack and his team will ultimately gain share through. If you think about really their pitches, they are the only ones that basically sell the full services. McGraw-Hill has very little extension supplemental platinum equity bar from Apollo. I think probably and they have already made an acquisition. I think they are going to try to do more of that and then Savas, as far as I know, the other big player does not have very little extensions supplemental smoke. So Hoften has the best kind of Playbook that can bring you the full menu. And so if they are able to gain share in that, that would imply that normalized billings is a higher number than what it is been, historically. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Perfect. Well, Chris, I think we have covered most of the main points here, but I want to make sure is there anything we didn't touch on HMHC that you think we should have touched on? Anything we kind of glossed over that you wish we had hit harder.<br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Looking through, I do not think so. I think we touched on everything. I think he did a great job. As always, is asking questions. I think that this summary again is for the reason, I won't rehash. Well, we think the process is flawed, because of the forecast and the other things we talked about. We think the value is this bit extra tender, extremely undervalues the business looking at trailing earnings and comps and kind of the future. The other thing is it makes little sense to go sell this one. We are still recovering from COVID and early in that transformation. I think they are still future sources upside from it. And lastly, I think they are just a much better plan here with compensating the CEO doing the buyback and you've already got activist shareholders publicly saying that they would nominate directors to help kind of get the board more aligned. So there is a very clear, I think also different from Great Canadian is, there is a much more clear path on what the future looks like. The shareholder base and hopefully the management team and everything. <br><br>So the downside from my perspective is to not tendering is very low and I think some people would ask if you do not tender and it happens, you are still going to get the $21. So that if they ultimately get 50% but the downside is low and I think the upside is huge because non-tender scenario as we talked about. This is a thirty and really a forty-plus dollar stock and a few years, I think. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Look, I wrap it up with neither of us is looking to form a group with anyone. We want to make that clear. But if you are a shareholder or potential shareholder, you know, you should do your own work. Come to your own conclusions. But if you think this deal is too low, you should send a letter to the board and let them know. "Hey, I think this deal is too low", and if Veritas wants it, they need space fair price. And if they do not, I am not going to tender my share and I would support buying back shares, doing tender offers to shrink the share account, get the arms out. <br><br>So I would just say, if you are a shareholder, potential shareholder, do your own work. We're not looking to form a group but let the board know that you do not support this deal and do not tend to your shares because then Veritas will have to bump or we can try to run the more shareholder-friendly playbook. Do you want to add anything to that? <br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> No, I think that is well summarized so.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Perfect. Well, Chris, I appreciate you coming on. I am hoping this one works out as well or better than Great Canadian. We are talking before I know you have got a lot of other great ideas and we have some overlap. So we are going to have to have you out back on, hopefully, quicker than it took from the last time, but I'll include a link to the breach and letter and the show notes. People can go ahead and read that to see more of the thought process here. Chris is on Twitter under a bridge and I will include a link to that if people want to slide on into his DMs. Chris thank you so much for coming on and looking forward to the next time. <br><br><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, really appreciate it. Great job as always Andrew and look forward to hopefully a great outcome again here and talking to the future. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Perfect.<br><br>[End]</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Premium: A lazy event idea]]></title><description><![CDATA[I&#8217;ve mentioned several times how rich the event set in rumored financial deals is right now, and I&#8217;ve recommended two in the past ~month.

The short story is that the Russian market has looked cheap for years. When the market dipped before the Ukraine invasion, a lot of investors stepped in, bought the weakness, and then got demolished when Russia invaded and sanctions sent most of the index components to zero.</p><p>Anyway, I got quite a few emails from people on the heels of that post who said something along the lines of &#8220;I thought RSX looked cheap but I couldn&#8217;t buy it because it felt icky morally&#8221; or &#8220;The people who bought RSX deserve the beating they got; buying RSX in the wake of (or lead up to) the Ukrainian invasion was/is morally reprehensible.&#8221;</p><p>Those emails got me thinking: should morals come into the picture when it comes to investing?</p><p>My gut reaction is no. The goal of investing is to make money. As long as you&#8217;re not doing anything illegal, who cares if that money comes from investing in green energy or coal stocks? Take the money you make from investing and use it to change / improve the world on your own time.</p><p>Plus, if you&#8217;re going to let morals come into investing, whose morals are you going to use? 50 years ago investors would have looked at tobacco stocks as consumer staples and anything that touched cannabis as the height of illegality; today legalizing and normalizing cannabis is a social justice issue and tobacco is the ultimate sin stock. Heck, two months ago, most institutional investors would have said guns and weapons were off-limits sin stocks; today it&#8217;s looking like <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-28/weapons-group-points-to-ukraine-in-bid-to-shape-eu-s-esg-rules?sref=dDBMMhhT">they might get added to ESG funds</a> as <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/russia-ukraine-latest-news-2022-03-02/card/esg-rules-bend-with-war-seb-says-it-is-ok-to-invest-in-defense-stocks-again-iPvqQL3PW4Kr6UcuGDuj">investors look for ways to support Ukraine.</a></p><p>So, in general, I&#8217;m ok with investing in pretty much anything. However, particularly for concentrated investors, I do think there&#8217;s an argument to be made that investing ethically / morally will help you avoid some land mines / blow ups, and avoiding those land mines will improve your performance in the long term.</p><p>An example might show this best: Valeant is a stock that a heck of a lot of investors blew up on in the mid-2010s. Now, there were lots of issues at Valeant. But Valeant&#8217;s core business was basically buying drugs that were already on the market and then hiking their price ~10x. I know lots of investors<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-buffett-valeant/buffett-munger-slam-valeant-drugmaker-turned-into-a-sewer-idUSKCN0XR0NC"> (including Buffett and Munger!</a>) who were quick passes on Valeant not because of any of the accounting issues or business issues or anything, but because they looked at the Valeant business model as deeply unethical and were quick passes on that. </p><p>Anyway, I don&#8217;t have the answers here. But it is something I&#8217;ve been thinking about, and I will at least be considering the &#8220;ethics&#8221; of the companies I invest in going forward.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weekend thoughts: finding value in the rubble]]></title><description><![CDATA[My preferred benchmark, the Russell 2000, is currently down ~10% on the year and ~20% from its peak in early November.

Most of the stocks I follow feel like they&#8217;ve been hit much, much harder than the index. </p><p>But with that carnage comes opportunity. Most of the places I&#8217;m finding value are tracking in one of three places:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Rumored deals: </strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>What is this? </strong>I<a href="https://yetanothervalueblog.substack.com/p/mgi-and-the-opportunity-set-in-rumored?s=w"> mentioned these a few weeks ago, </a>but perhaps my favorite place currently is companies where a financial (not strategic) buyer has made a public bid for a company and the stock continues to languish below the offer price. The thinking here is simple: a financial buyer is making the offer because they think the stock is undervalued, so buying below that offer gives you multiple ways to win. The buyer could be right and the stock is undervalued, another buying group could step in, a strategic could step in at a big premium, etc.</p></li><li><p><strong>Can you give an example? </strong>The <a href="https://yetanothervalueblog.substack.com/p/mgi-and-the-opportunity-set-in-rumored?s=w">post a few weeks ago focused on MGI</a> and <a href="https://www.bamsec.com/filing/110465922030880?cik=883902">mentioned CNR as a possibility</a>, and just this week we saw C<a href="https://www.bamsec.com/filing/110465922030880?cik=883902">NR pop when their &#8220;rumored&#8217; deal went definitive</a>. I&#8217;m still seeing lots of opportunities in this set of names (in fact, I wrot<a href="https://yetanothervalueblog.substack.com/p/gambling-on-a-special-situation?s=w">e two up on the </a>premium side<a href="https://yetanothervalueblog.substack.com/p/premium-going-through-the-event-pipeline?s=w"> in the past couple of weeks)</a>, and I suspect the opportunity set here will remain interesting. Markets are shaky, lots of companies trade for low multiples, and there&#8217;s tons of dry powder on the sidelines. That combo should make for a continued rich set of rumored deals.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>COVID &#8220;winners&#8221; that have been slaughtered on fears of a return to normal. </strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>What is this? </strong>A ton of businesses were massive beneficiaries of COVID, and investors are selling first and asking questions later as they worry that the huge pull forward from COVID is unsustainable. The headliner here are business like Zoom or Peloton, but there are plenty of others that have been sneakily decimated. For example, legacy retailers across the board generally benefitted from COVID. Mom and pop stores closed, consumers were desperate to spend, and supply chain issues meant the companies didn&#8217;t have to worry about discounting to move items, which juiced margins. Today, I can list probably a dozen retailers that are reporting record results but trade for low to mid single digit EBITDA multiples because investors are worried about a pending crash.</p></li><li><p><strong>Can you give an example?</strong> Sure. Dicks (DKS) EBITDA jumped from $771mm in FY19 to ~$2.4B in FY21. They<a href="https://www.bamsec.com/filing/108906322000011?cik=1089063"> reported earnings this week</a> and guided FY22 to roughly flat same store sales (SSS) and ~$12-13/share in EPS. As I write this, the stock is trading for ~$110/share, so they&#8217;re trading for maybe 4x LTM EBITDA and ~9x forward P/E. They&#8217;re also returning capital like crazy; the current market cap is just under $11B, and they repurchased ~$1.1B of shares in FY21 alongside paying out &gt;$600m in dividends. So, no matter how you cut it, this company is cheap; the market is clearly saying current results are unsustainable and that they have zero confidence in the near terms earnings outlook. Maybe that&#8217;s true, but I think the stock&#8217;s are too cheap even if you assume a big reversion towards pre-pandemic earnings.</p><ul><li><p>I went on th<a href="https://twitter.com/hardmoneymag/status/1501991518818603011?s=20&amp;t=HiQ-yNR4sWKdqGWvcJ7Pvw">e &#8220;hard money&#8221; podcast</a> and we mainly talked sporting good retailers trading cheaply and hammering their share count if you&#8217;re interested. I enjoyed it!</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Second derivative oil / commodity winners</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>What is this? </strong>For those of you living under a rock, oil and gas prices have absolutely ripped in the wake of Russia invading Ukraine. Most companies with direct oil and gas exposure have ripped in kind (though I believe most of their stock prices still imply some skepticism of the current commodities curve), but there are a variety of companies that will be second order beneficiaries of rising oil and gas prices that haven&#8217;t seen their share prices move much.</p></li></ol><ul><li><p><strong>Can you give an example? </strong>Of course; heck, I&#8217;ll give you two interesting ones!</p><ul><li><p>I&#8217;ve been following<a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewRangeley/status/1402967314233008129?s=20&amp;t=kIMsRUzm_LPexB8xpsalZA"> </a><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewRangeley/status/1402967314233008129?s=20&amp;t=kIMsRUzm_LPexB8xpsalZA">BSM</a></strong><a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewRangeley/status/1402967314233008129?s=20&amp;t=kIMsRUzm_LPexB8xpsalZA"> since Andrew Carreon </a>pitched it on the podcast last June. When he pitched it, BSM stock was at ~$10/share while oil was at ~$70/barrel and nat gas was at ~$3. Here we are ~9 months later; BSM has done well (the stock is at ~$12.50/share), but nat gas and oil have both exploded (nat is approaching $5, oil well over $100). BSM is a double beneficiary of rising commodity prices; not only do they make more money on the royalties from their wells, but higher prices encourages more drilling on their lands, which creates more cash flows / royalties in the longer term. BSM has basically no debt at this point, so any increase in cash flow can go back to shareholders through either share repurchases or increased dividends. The stock is under $13, and if oil/gas stay anywhere near the current strip prices I think it&#8217;s entirely possible BSM pays out &gt;$2/share in annual dividends going forward.</p></li><li><p><strong>Oil refiners</strong> are absolutely minting money at current spreads. Oil refiners operate on<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crackspread.asp#:~:text=A%20crack%20spread%20is%20the,to%20the%20spread%20in%20prices."> &#8220;crack spreads&#8221;</a>, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/refining-margins-fuel-costs-surge-fallout-russian-invasion-2022-03-08/">crack spreads have been ballooning</a> given the rise in energy prices and tight supply for refined products. Plus, refiners operate in a global market, and U.S. refiners should have a mammoth advantage over their global counter parts given how much cheaper nat gas is domestically versus internationally. Despite that, many refiners stocks continue to languish. <strong>Consider MPC,</strong> the stock is flat over the past month despite their global peers getting demolished and crack spreads blowing out. The company is an aggressive share repurchaser (they bought back &gt;10% of their shares outstanding last year), and I expect they&#8217;ll continue to be aggressive given<a href="https://www.bamsec.com/filing/151029522000006?cik=1510295"> they just authorized another $5B</a> (&gt;10% of their market cap). Their stock is at &lt;$80, and I think a conservative SOTP is &gt;$100/share before even factoring in the windfall from the current environment.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ol><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabe40e82-abd8-45fd-a996-1c3eacae2e64_1154x632.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabe40e82-abd8-45fd-a996-1c3eacae2e64_1154x632.png" width="1154" height="632" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/abe40e82-abd8-45fd-a996-1c3eacae2e64_1154x632.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:632,&quot;width&quot;:1154,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:41916,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabe40e82-abd8-45fd-a996-1c3eacae2e64_1154x632.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabe40e82-abd8-45fd-a996-1c3eacae2e64_1154x632.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabe40e82-abd8-45fd-a996-1c3eacae2e64_1154x632.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabe40e82-abd8-45fd-a996-1c3eacae2e64_1154x632.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Anyway, those are my three favorite areas to look for opportunities currently (<a href="https://yetanothervalueblog.substack.com/p/tegus-sponsored-deep-dive-1-cable?s=w">alongside cable, of course</a>!). I know the current environment is scary, but there are a lot of companies that look way too cheap in any scenario outside a massive depression or World War 3. So I wanted to run through a few example as well as make a request: I&#8217;m always looking for <strong>both </strong>new opportunities and <strong>pushback </strong>on my current idea set. So, if you&#8217;ve got any opportunities that fit into any of those buckets (or some other bucket that I haven&#8217;t thought of yet!), I&#8217;d love to hear about them.

I'm your host, Andrew Walker and with me today, I'm happy to have back on, Louis Camhi. Louis's new title, he's the founder and CIO of RLH Capital. Louis, how's it going?<br><br><strong>Louis Camhi</strong>: It's great. Thanks for having me back. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Hey, thanks for coming back on. Let me start this podcast the way I do every podcast. First, a disclaimer to remind everyone, nothing on this podcast is investing advice. Please consult a financial advisor, do your own work, not investing advice. Second, with the pitch for you my guest, people can go listen to our first podcast back in August through the Full Pitch. <br><br>But since then, some pretty big news, I said new title. You launched a new fund that's focused exclusively on SPACs and maybe this SPAC, but I think, mainly on SPACS. So I just want to congratulate you on launching the new fund. <br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Thank you. It's exciting even though I would say SPAC's probably the most hated asset as right now, I just still think there are a lot of opportunities and a lot to be done. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yeah. Hey, I 100% agree with you. Sometimes I post on the blog so much on SPACs that I'll get emails from people that are like, "Hey, that's probably enough on SPACs," and I get it. But I just think these SPACs are super hated right now. I just love the free optionality. We all want to catch the next DWAC, but we'll talk about all that. <br><br>Let's start. Maybe, I want to hit three things. Opportunities and SPACs, opportunities in these SPACs, and maybe a quick update on Origin, which was the focus of our last podcast. It probably makes sense to start with the update on Origin. The ticker there is ORGN. I'll remind everyone, smaller-cap company. They're hoping to be EBITDA positive in 2025. They're building out some plans. So please do your own work. There are a lot of risks here. But that out the way, I'll just turn it over to you. What's been going on with origin since our last podcast?<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Sure, so I can't believe it's been over 6 months since our last podcast, time flies. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> I thought it has been like 2 or 3 in the back of my mind. But yeah, time just flies.<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Yeah, I know. Same. So, I looked up, I was just curious. Like, where's the market? Where's the Origin since we last spoke. Origin's basically flat which is interesting because well, I love the company. If we take a step back and think about the macro, Origin is everything the market doesn't like right now in terms of very early stage, non-revenue-generating, etcetera. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yup.<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> But unlike a lot of these other SPACs or companies more broadly that haven't executed on their plan, Origin has been executing pretty nicely. I know that's a weird thing to say when there's no revenue but they laid out all their targeted dates when they want to have each step of construction done, and that's farther running ahead. So it's nice to see us back with solid execution. <br><br>So just to run through the update, when we spoke it was right after they announced their second-quarter earnings or backlog was 3.5 billion for their pipeline. Now, it's 5.6 billion. So, I don't think anyone who's bullish at least is never questioned the demand but you're seeing a lot of healthy growth. They announced the site for origin, too. More importantly, I think they did an okay job of mentioning that they're now fully funded. <br><br>The reason's a little confusing is they received a $400 million dollar allocation of municipal bonds from Louisiana and there's a provision in the 2021 infrastructure and job that states effectively that if you're involved in decarbonization, you can get a multiplier on an allocation for municipal bonds. So that means they're going to be able to finance the entire cost of Origin 2, using tax-exempt bonds which is effectively the second-lowest cost of finance after government bonds.<br><br>I think that's a big positive that you've now taken financing risk off the table. The demand is already being played out. There's someone on Twitter who asked this, "I think the initial plan is to build Origin 2 with one train?" My understanding is that the second train can be added at any time. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> What is the train? What is the difference between the first and the second [crosstalk]?<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Think about it as your capacity, right?<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yup.<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> When they laid out their base case and their upside case was, their upside case was we can build another train in our current location. So, when I spoke to them and I asked that very question, they said, "Look, we can build a second train at any point. So what we're really going to evaluate is does it make sense to build a second train or does it make sense to pull forward construction on Origin 3? <br><br>I think that's something we want to be pushing them on over the coming quarters. See what are the pros and cons? What are the timing costs, etcetera? But it sounds like we're going to get that capacity regardless it's just a matter of is it in the wrapper of a train or in the wrapper of another facility? The other thing that I was excited to hear them say is to reiterate their capital budget. Obviously, we see inflation is off the charts. <br><br>I'm really curious, these guys are conservative but you got to think with oil prices where they are now that their pricing power is significantly higher because the cost of the incumbent plastic is going to be that much higher. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yup.<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Then with respect to timing, they reiterated the timeline but if you go through the investor presentation, they show that the evaporator module was bolted 3 months ahead of schedule and for the piping fabrication 6 months. I think there is some optionality of an upside surprise for Origin 1. At the end of the day, my thesis has nothing to do with whether this comes on at the end of the year or a few months earlier. But positive is good. <br><br>When someone asked the question, "Why haven't they revised forward the timeline?" I just looked at this market and think, "They're not going to get any credit." If they said, "Okay, until the end of Q4 we're going to come on at the beginning of Q4." No one's going to care. Heaven forbid, they say, we're coming on at the beginning of Q4 and ends up being the middle of Q4, people are going to hate that. So I think they're being very prudent in their approach. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Look, I will just say not an expert on the company but having spent a lot of time looking at SPACs when I was updating for this project, people who are watching on YouTube can probably see me looking at their debt. Like, as I was getting ready for this project podcast, I was really impressed by they do this thing where they show, "Hey, here's where we projected when we did our deal. Here's where we updated kind of bad or analysts there," and whenever, "And here's what we actually achieved." Everything they've said they beat often by several quarters or something that several years. I was just really impressed because anyone who's followed this back road, as we'll probably talk in a second, like, beating schedules and coming in under budget, or on time is not exactly what you see from SPACs. I think that's what you said in the original podcast, right? You were like, "This is a real team. Yes, they're going public to our SPAC, but these are real guys who are really serious."<br>I also really like that they're going, is it Geismar? Is that Geismar, Louisiana?<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Yeah. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> I'm from New Orleans. I spent a ton of time in Baton Rouge. I was down there just a couple of months ago and Geismar is right between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. I've never been there obviously. It's a very small town but... <br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> We're going to send you for the site visits then because we [inaudible] [crosstalk]<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> You know what? I'm going back in April for a wedding. So, maybe I'll try and sneak out and take some photos. So you guys will get some photos of me in hard hats.<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Love it.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yup. Anything else we should be talking about Origin?<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Yeah. Just real quick. The idea of Partnerships and Licensing comes up a lot. People ask, I ask them every single time I speak with them. The current plan is to go at it alone. They're saying there probably will be partnerships but you just can't adjust the timeline. It sounds like there are 2 types of potential partnerships. One is for customers who say, "You know what? We need our own plant." We just have such high demand and so they will build a plant. It'll be all theirs and they will pay a royalty licensing component back to Origin. <br><br>The other is they'll partner with the chemicals player. I know Dow gets thrown out there a lot. We'll use them as an example. I've no idea of Dows. If it could be Dow, Chevron, or Exxon, whoever. Similarly, like in their efforts to go green and focus on ESG, they'll invest in the cost of the plan and similarly pay a royalty. So, I think those things happen. I have no idea when. Intuitively, it makes sense to me that they happen with Origin 1 launching because I think Origin 1 really derisks the construction risk. <br><br>Now, the other thing, 2 other points, people are asking for more disclosure. I've been working at hedge funds for most of my career. I've never gone up to a company I was covering and said, "Give me less." So I think that's normal, we always want more. As you know, Andrew, I'm on the board of a company. We have that same discussion constantly. Once you provide it once, you always have to provide it. I just think that we just have to accept that fact. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Let me ask you a quick, so Origin 1, which is it's not as big as Origin 2 but that is their first one under construction. They say it's on time, on a budget, everything. It is supposed to be done by the end of 2022. So you'll get revenue from it from 2023. People can go look at their debts. I'm looking at their March deck on page 43, they even break out. "Hey, here's our next 10 years' projected financials." <br><br>In 2023, the revenue starts coming online from Origin 1. Now, there's still going to be EBITDA on everything negative because they've got lots of other costs. But do you think they're going to really give lots of breakdowns on, "Hey, here's how profitable like isolate everything else? Here's how profitable Origin 1 specifically is."<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> I don't know factually but I hope so because as an analyst, what you want to see is how do those unit economics compare to the deck? If they're remotely close, I think we're in really good shape. And if they're not, we may not be in. So they know that and I think they want to show. The other thing is when they show those unit economics, it kind of gets the partners talking, right? Potential partners. Like, "Oh, wow, look at those economics, we should be involved here." <br><br>So I think there's a lot of reasons for them to do it and because of their IP, they don't have to worry about, "Hey, if we show our unit economics, we'll trigger the next guy to start building plants because they just don't have the know-how. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Let me ask one more question. This is no off-the-cuff. There's the old thing like a lawyer never asked a question, he doesn't know the answer too. Well, the podcast says, "Those ask a question he doesn't know answers to." But I think back to when we were talking in October, a lot of people were excited about Origin when they would look at DNMR scientific, DNMR. And I know they're not the same obviously, but DNMR at the time we were talking, was trading at like 15 or 20 or something, right?<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Yeah.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> And that had come down from a peak of almost 50. As you and I are talking today, the stock is under 5. Again, lots of differences between the two companies. But if there are similarities, I would look at the DNMR price and say like, "Okay, yes, that company is not executing Origin's executing. But does the DNMR price give you worries that, "Hey, maybe there's not the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow for Origin, just based on kind of how DNMR has been acting?"<br><br>Because, Origin right now, they raised a lot of money. They're training for a little bit above the value of their cash, but not much. Maybe that's Dow. Maybe it's people saying, "There's not a pot of gold once these get built."<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Well, I honestly don't view Origin as having cash, right? Because even though it's on their balance sheet, it's all committed. So, like when I think about valuation, I think about, let's pretend they spend the cash, let's pretend they have the debt on their books from this facility. So in my mind, even though they're net cash they're really not that. I know that makes no sense, but hopefully, that [crosstalk]. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> I 100% get you.<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> I don't know DNMR that well, but they decided to go do an acquisition. As a result of that acquisition, they no longer had the cash to finance their facility. So, it's a tough time for companies like this. They were forced to raise or convert, and then you have to convert, our guys come in like, I know, David Einhorn in his letter, he's still bullish to DNMR but he said like, "We were surprised about this convert so we dumped our common and bolt to convert. It was the better security." <br><br>I'm not looking to than that. These companies are all hit. You need to execute. The nice thing for Origin, which I think we're 60% which would be like a bull case for SPAC today. But because of high redemption for them, people were worried that they wouldn't have enough capital to finance Origin 2. They now announce that risk is off the table. The hard thing is when people say, "What gets to stock up? <br><br>I think it's 2 things. One, I think our catalysts as Origin 1, and two, we're just more macro-oriented. Origin is not going to massively outperform in a market like this that does not like, let's call it VC stage complex. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yep.<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> I do like that Origin insiders have been buying fairly aggressively. No insiders sell, all insiders buy. Boone whose SPAC-sponsored plans on buying quarterly and he's been doing so. So people are definitely putting their money where their mouths are.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yep and the buying started at $5 to $6 dollars and now we're talking it's approaching 5$. So they've been buying higher than current prices. <br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Yeah.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Anything else you want to update on Origin or should we turn it over to the SPAC market? <br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Let's go SPACs.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Great. Well, look, I think you actually said something in there that is a nice transition to SPAC. So just you said Origin at the time they did the deal, there were 60% redemptions and people were like, "Oh my God, what an awful disaster." Today, I think there'd be a lot of SPACs who would be shooting fireworks into the air if they only had 60% redemptions. We're seeing some SPACs that are like 99.5% redemptions or something. <br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> The average redemption rate in February was 88%. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> It's incredible. The way SPACs are trading after the deals go through, I don't know why you wouldn't redeem but it is interesting. I'll just give some brief overview back in last like January through March when SPACs were super hot and I'm looking at SVFA as just one example. That is SoftBank's first SPAC. The stock price was $11 per share, no deal, $10 in Trust. But a buzzy-sponsored SoftBank stock price is $11 per share and it's all anyone who wanted to talk about with me, right?<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Yeah. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> And today, SVFA is 978 per share. Guess what? They've got less than a year to find a deal or else they'll liquidate. So you're getting a 2% plus cash yield. And if they announced a great deal, the stock could go to infinity. No one wants to talk about it, no one wants to touch it, and that's just one example. Please do your own work, do your own thoughts. But it's just one example of, just nobody wants to talk about SPACs. I just see this great opportunity. I want to also review, what are you thinking about pre-deal SPACs where you have seen opportunities, how are you thinking about the market right now? <br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Sure. Well, first and foremost, I want to say that the Twitter SPAC Community is really fantastic. So we should start there. There are tons of resources for anyone who's watching this and isn't as familiar, you hashtag SPAC and you will find a lot of content from the smart people. <br><br>Listen, going to your point, at one point last year, the average pre-announced SPAC was $11, and post announced $14. I remember looking at this and saying it's kind of amazing the markets telling, you pay 10% premium for cash and that will go to a 40% premium. And that's a lot of money and it's all great until it's not. Right now, the majority of SPACs pre-announced Riposte answered our trading sub 10. So to your point, it's turned into a fixed income type product. <br><br>Like when I describe some of the SPAC averages that I do in the fund, I call it fixed income plus-plus. In your case, the average yield right now is about 2.8%. And it's interesting, if you think about you're buying, something that it has a 2.8% yield of SPAC by treasuries in the J.P. Morgan account. So why people are buying treasuries yielding 60 basis points and not SPACs? I'm not sure and I'm actually having that very conversation with a couple of corporate because they have big treasury operations and it makes no sense to me.<br><br>But now, you're actually getting paid optionality. This is a cost of capital question. You may say, making 2.8% is not what I want to do, but it's 2.8% plus, and in a lot of cases, you can buy the units for under Trust Value, in which case you're earning a little bit of a cash yield and you retain all this upside optionality. We should talk about warrant prices in a little bit but warrant prices are so low right now that when you have a good shot at making mid to high single-digit returns with no risk. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Can I just say, before we talk more because I do want to talk more because you and I view them a little bit differently. On the plus, my background with investors I've talked to recently is everyone dismisses the plus, all right? They say, "Oh the days of February 2021 are over, SPAC pops above 10 when they announced a deal and it does feel accurate right now. But I just keep pointing to them. Look back to October. DWAC, which is the SPAC that's merging with Trump's SPAC, the day before they announced the merger is trading under trust value. <br><br>As you and I are speaking, it's trading at almost $100 per share, right? That's a 10x on what was relatively before the deal. Buying under Trust is a relatively riskless position. Now, obviously, not everything's going to... I wish I don't have a position at DWAC, I wish I did. Not everything's going to do that but it only takes one for that to at for your basket of Treasury Securities that you bought at a 2% yield, all of sudden to yield 8% or something. Right? <br><br>So I think people are so dismissive of that risk, and I think there's going to be a couple of smart sponsors that find a deal that causes a pop. Getting better than cash returns with that upset optionality, I think people are very dismissive of it and I'm still not 100% sure why. <br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Well, let's also just look at the last deal of that price. I don't know anything about the sponsor. I'm not involved. It's called Shuaa Partners, S-H-U-A-A. SHUAU is the ticker. And just IPO it's trading at 999. It is 1025 in Trust and offers half of the warranty. So you could sit there by that paper knowing, the worst-case scenario you make 2.5%. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yep. <br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> That's the case, you know that warrant is worth something and it's more or right now warranty trading at about 35 cents average, give or take. So let's just assume as soon as it starts trading, you sell that. So your 2.5% plus your 3.5%, you've made 6% with no risk. To me, that's a fantastic return now. <br><br>I tell people and investing in SPACs if you think this was before kind of the carnage of the last few months. If you think and as I said you go up 30% a year, this price isn't the best trade for you. But if you don't, I think the risk-reward here is great. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Just on SHUAA. I just put up the S1 as you were talking in. Look, it's not just you're buying at... let's just call it 10 to make you're buying the units, which include a warrant at 10, these guys have 15 months to do a deal, or else they're going to return 1025. So 2.5% for 15 months. I mean, I think 10-year treasuries yield 2.5%. So you're getting that great optionality there and if they announced a deal the warrant will have some value. I just think it's a fantastic combo and I'm with you.<br><br>For pre-IPO SPACs, every time somebody asked me, "What's your best idea right now?" I say, "Honestly, it's probably Pershing Square Tontine" Which I know everybody's burnt out on that but you're buying it 1% below Trust. They've got less than a year until they need to liquidate that thing, so you get 1%. And if they announced a deal, they think you go parabolic and you get the Tontine warrants and everything in there like risk. I get that it's not as high upside as a lot of other things people talk about, but risk-adjusted. It seems tough to beat.<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> I completely agree. So what we're talking about right now is kind of that safer end of the SPAC risk Spectrum, which is where right now, I mostly play as a fund but there are just tons of these opportunities where if all goes wrong-- Sorry?<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> On the safer end, are you more focused on... So SHUAA, right? If your IPOed in February 2021, because the IPO market was so hot, you got great terms, right? Ten dollars in Trust, very low warrants... <br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Twenty-four months, yeah. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> ... (24 months and all this. And then you just mentioned, sure, right? Which was 1025 in Trust. I don't know the warrants, it's probably, half over 1025 potentially on the Trust. At 1025 in Trust 15 months. If they want to extend, they've got to put extra cash in Trust. So are you more focused on the SPACs from yesteryear that is often trading 975 less than a year to go? Or are you more focused on the SPACs that are IPO today that are often treated in 1025 in Trust but really tight terms? Does that make sense? <br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Yeah, it's a little bit of both. And the way I think about it is, for me, it's first sponsor quality and then some underwriter quality and then the terms. So, I've always said when I was picking stocks, I'd rather have my list of, this is what I want to buy but it's too expensive. So I'll wait and I'll have that work done. Just similarly, I know this sounds kind of silly but I have price targets on these SPACs where I assume I'm going to get my Trust Value back. I have a framework for what I think the warrant could be worth and so it's simply as my downside case is getting Trust back. My upside case is getting Trust plus some value for the warrant. I'll run that sort and then, see okay, I'll put the names I'm interested in that's anything show up as being attractively priced. And the other is...<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> What are some? Oh, go ahead, please.<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> ... one of the other things is the liquidity here isn't great. So when you make your buy, you should be prepared to then sit with it. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yep, 100%. Hey, you mentioned your focus on top-tier sponsors a little bit underwriting quality. If you can, what are some previous SPACs that you are interested in or taking up? Do you think listeners should maybe go take an eye out if they're looking to pull some cash?<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Sure. At the risk of what you're talking my own book. So full disclosure...<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> When I said listeners, I'm more meant, what are some pre-deal SPACS I can go and kind of purchase that one. [crosstalk]<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> There's this SPAC called H.I.G. Acquisition Corp., and why I think it's interesting is, H.I.G. is a stand-alone Private Equity Firm. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yup.<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> So, unlike a lot of the SPACs that came to be because it was an executive or just a group of smart guys. This is a firm that one, it does deals for a living. Two, it has access to financing in LPs. And three, it has a pretty darn good track record. It's interesting because guys like this in the public markets, in the stock market, they don't have a KKR type of name but if you kind of does your research, you find out like this is a very good middle-market Private Equity Firm.<br><br>So, you look at this and you can buy. The common rate of the units right now, you could buy for 995 knowing you're getting $10 back in the third of the warrant. In this case, also, I would say, you can split it to as common trading at a really high yield or the warrant really cheap. In this case, the warrants are really cheap. So the safe way to do it is to buy the unit. The riskier way would be to buy the warrant outright. But you can [inaudible] a lot at a pretty healthy return if they do a deal and I would just assume that they would as a firm that does this on a day-to-day basis with access to capital.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> I want to ask about the warrants in a second because I know you and I might have a little bit different views and talk about the I think we're going to see a way of SPAC liquidation so we can wrap it all that. But I did have one question, I've just been thinking in the back of my mind that I thought you might be a good person to talk about. <br><br>So, these two recent SPACS, Black Rifle Coffee, which trades now under BRCC, and System1, which trades under SST, both of these merged recently. Both of them are typical for the SPAC Market heading into the merger. We're trading right around Trust, big redemptions for both of them. And now, both of them are trading way above what the Trust was, right? Trust is gone. So you can forget about that. <br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Right.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> But shareholders had the option. "Hey, do I want to own stock in this company, or do I want to redeem it for 10? The vast majority of people in both cases chose 10. And guess what? That proved wrong because here we are a couple of months later, System1's trading at about 1350, Black Rifle Coffee's trading at about 1750. So I wanted to ask you, do you read anything into that? Or do you think it's just, "Hey, we have seen one SPACs at huge redemptions often they just become trading sardines where people are flipping a really low float?<br><br>It's like System1, Black Rifle, a couple of others like, do you read anything into it where hey, good deals that are undervalued there's a lot of potential upsides? Or is it more, hey, check-in and six months because he's got a lot of redemptions they might just be there are options out and people are just trading around?<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> I think it's the latter. So let's start with System1. System1 had 99% redemptions. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yeah.<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> And so, the float right now is just so tiny. I always say the warrants don't lie. The warrants right now are trading at $37, which implies a high single-digit stock price. They file the S1 for the warrants already. I would venture to say as soon those warrant from exercisable, you'll see the common come under pressure.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Louis, do you want to pause for a second? You can see this with a lot of companies. So, DWCA, again the Trump SPAC trades at 97, and the DWACW warrants trade for way below that implied price. But do you want to pause for a second and just explain to listeners who aren't super familiar, why the warrant pricing might be out of line with the stock and why that might imply the stocks going a lot lower?<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Sure. So you would look at the warrant of the DWAC and you say, well there's a huge arbitrage opportunity here because I can create the common buying the warrants for much less than just buying the common outright. The problem is...<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Just to give people the math there. So DWAC warrants, the last I looked traded for like $23 per share right now. The warrant lets you buy the stock for 1150. So that would imply the stock is worth about 35. DWAC trades 495. So there's a 60 dollar per share are up there just to explain what Louis is talking about there. <br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> That's exactly right. So you would say, "Okay. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to buy the warrants and I'm going to short the stock." The problem is, right now, I'm checking if you want to short the stock, it will cost you 117%. Since you don't know the timing or anything, it's just not an actionable trade because you can't collapse the warrant and you're going to pay a huge cost for it. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yep. As Louis mentioned, it's because the warrants aren't registered, it normally takes some time. Once the warrants are registered, then you could actually exercise the warrants and collapse the spread but the market is saying, "Hey, once the spread collapses, the stocks are going down." So, I'll just pause here to remind everyone, we're on an arbitrage shorting, very risky. Please, please, please, I basically avoid turning at this point, please do your own work and consider that. Anything you want to talk about?<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> On SST, the only difference, so warrants are exercisable on the later of one-year post IPO. For 30 days post the deal but an act of S1 needs to be filed. For SST, the IPO is in June 2020. So we're much past a year and the deal closed at the end of January. So we're now past the 30-day marker and so it's all about having an effect of S1. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yep.<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> They filed their initial S1, when that goes effective, is up to the SEC usually within 2 weeks. But if that's right within 2 weeks, those warrants become exercisable, and that arbitrage trade if you will, will collapse. This means either the warrant should trade up or the common to trade down. Historically, it's the latter that happens. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yep. Perfect. Let's use that to transition to pre-deal SPAC warrants. I'll let you explain the thesis but I know a lot of people who make a really good argument, pre-deal SPAC warrants have been just so tossed out of the water. They're such cheap optionality. They represent a really interesting opportunity. Why don't you give that thesis, not a review? I've kind of had a different viewpoint so I can push back a little bit. But why don't you start by laying that out? <br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Sure. So, when I started investing in SPAC warrants. The previous SPAC warrants were in 2015, and they were 40 cents. So up until now, you would always hear those remember when stories, like "You remember when we bought the Capital acquisition warrants at 40 cents and they wanted to..." "That was just amazing." Or, "We bought the Trinity warrant at 40 cents and they end up taken out for..." There were so many examples and obviously, you never buy enough in hindsight. Now, the difference is back then, there were much fewer SPACs but at the same time, no one knew what SPAC was. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yep.<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> So the ability of the deal done was similarly as challenging. You fast forward now, and it's... Okay. So we're actually getting back there where I think I just saw before I hopped on the median pre-announced back is 36 cents. So we're back to those levels even a little lower. But I think it's really important when you dig in and start segmenting what sort of SPAC you have? Who is the sponsor team? Who is the underwriter? <br><br>For me, it's thinking about do you have proprietary access to deal flow? Do you have access to financing whether that's in that market or equity markets? Are people going to trust in you to do a deal? You can take the extreme. The Gores franchise that's on their 9th SPAC, they're probably going to do a deal. Just my belief. <br><br>When you look at kind of the KKRs of the world who have a SPAC, the A-Rod is a huge private equity firm. I think they're going to get deals done. But Barry Sternlicht complex, they've dedicated a lot of resources as fast. I think those guys, they've dedicated resources. They have their own capital so they can step up to these deals. They have access to deal flow and other capital through their core business operations. I think those guys get deals done. So, I'd rather pay up for quality here, whereas, just saying, I used to look at a list years ago. It's like, what are the cheapest warrants?<br><br>I think if you do that, you get yourself in trouble. Again, I have nothing negative about these specific sponsors, but there is a host of warrants right now trading below 20 cents. Like you and I can sit here and say, "That is so cheap." But it's cheap for a reason. Don't get me wrong, some of them can get deals done, and those will be great pieces of paper but when I think about "Where is the risk of liquidation?" The market is telling you, it's in this list.<br><br>As I flipped through it right now in real-time, I don't see any names that I recognize either as a private Equity Firm, a hedge fund, or just a prominent financial institution. Similarly, I don't think it's a surprise, you look at the underwriters. You're not seeing like a Goldman Sachs under its back on this list which I think tells you that people have more faith that, if you did your deal with Goldman, Goldman has a big M&amp;A operation. They're going to find something to shove down your SPAC. It may not be a great deal, may not be a good deal at all. But you'll get that announcement. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> So let me just give a slight push SPAC stat. So I definitely hear that and I agree, there's opportunity. I know people who run Monte Carlo models and say, "Look at 40 cents, these things are buying." I was laughing when you were saying back in the 2015 days because I've got a friend whose ex-Citadel as I know you are. When I talked to him, he's always talking about... <br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> I was, you cannot tell that to anyone.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> ... totally, the same deals and same warrants that you talk about. So I was just kind of laughing there. So I hear all that. But I do worry like they're just so many SPACs out there. That even with somebody sponsors, we're going to see waves of deal failures and SPAC liquidations. Even with Buzzy sponsors, this is out there but like ATIP which was backed... I think that was Fortress. <br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Fortress, yeah.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Fortress took on private. I know me and a couple of other people took it back because we're like, "Oh, this is physical therapy, contracted out and then that company, I mean, they're probably going to file or have to restructure or something and the stock goes from 10 to 2. I'm worried like, you buy these warrants at 40 cents, thinking, "Hey, these are good SPAC sponsors that will announce the deal. I worry the liquidations are going to come in a little higher than you think and then every SPAC deal that gets done is going to go from 10 to 6. <br><br>So you break even on the warrants that you do buy and you lose money that you get deals through and you lose money on the ones that liquidate. So all laying your like break even or lose a little and drop opportunity cost is just awful. Does that make sense?<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Sure, but I'll push back a little bit. So, a $6 stock usually has a warrant that runs a dollar. So your real risk is exactly what you said. If you're buying these, pick your number, 40 cents. I'm buying mine a little bit higher because I'm skewing for quality. There's a big question if these smart sponsors can figure out what the market wants right now? Right? <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yep.<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Then if you take a step back, as much as we're all pretty sick of talking about Nikola, right? Nikola was the first Biggie SPAC. If you were paying attention, you saw it go from 10 to 80. So, every other sponsor they'd like, "Okay. This is what the market wants." They want something conceptual, something if you address it, they don't care that there's no [unintelligible] and so, they did all these EV deals and that worked at a time. I think this project finished really smart. So it would be unrealistic for them to say, "You know what? The market wants cash-flowing companies, with some growth and a reasonable valuation. So can we figure out a way to do a deal that sticks at 10 or I joke around?"<br><br>If a sponsor can do a deal that only destroys 20% of value. So, 8 bucks, the warrants are worth a dollar 70. If you're buying them at 50 cents, that's a triple. So now we get into okay, well, what's your liquidation rate? Because obviously at zero and we'll find out, but my view is that it's lower for these higher-quality sponsors and it's probably higher for lower-quality sponsors. Some of the sponsors that are going out now and doing a one-year term, full warrant overfunded trust, looks great to the IPO investor, but it just makes it that much harder to do a deal.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Makes so sense. So you mentioned Gores, a lot of the private equity sponsors. Any under-the-radar sponsors that you think the markets discounting a little bit that you think are interesting?<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> So, I mentioned H.I.G. just because of the same setup. Another one is would be like One Equity Partners. One Equity Partners was the old Merchant Bank of JPMorgan. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yep. <br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> So similarly, you know private Equity Firm. I've got a lot of them on my list. The question is, "Are the returns high enough for me?" Like I'm waiting for better prices, but there's the TPG. Well, Social Capital to me is not interesting with the common above 10, but you had your window a couple of weeks ago where dropped below. So kind of my case in point of putting these on your watch list. If you could buy something like that under 10 like of church...<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> A few minutes ago, I had mentioned SoftBank SPAC which is trading at 980. If we had talked a few weeks ago, I would have used IPOD &amp; IPOF because both of them were below 10 and I would have said, "Look, every SHUAA SPAC has traded above 10 at some point. Like you've got the optionality to buy it at 990 yet, liquidates or it's an awful deal. Okay, you made 1% and your opportunity cost wasn't that great, but IPOF here we are. It's gone from 992 to 1035 and you keep hearing whispers from the internet people, "Hey, maybe, he's going to take SpaceX public." <br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Yeah. And some other ones like [inaudible], equity distribution acquisition (EQD), that's Sam Zell. Like when you think about the ability to finance he can write the pipe from his back pocket. He's pretty got it set, cash in like lost in his couch. Another one, I know these guys I think they're really good investors, it is a firm called Corsair. Of course, they are partnering Corp., CORS is the ticker. The same thing, they are a financially oriented private Equity Firm. Again, the same pillars of, they do deals for a living, they have LPs, they have access to capital, etcetera.<br><br>So, I just think that the odds of them doing a deal are probably higher than not and because people don't know who Corsair is because again, it's not a name you would know if you're just a public markets investor, the warrant trade is cheap which makes the units are cheap. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yep. Let's see. Anything else we should be talking about with pre-deals SPACs? I wanted to mention these SPACS quickly if that works, but anything else on pre-deals SPACs?<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> I don't think so. We can talk about some... I mean a lot of people talking are about CND in a circle which we can talk about a little bit if you'd like. Otherwise, we can definitely get into some deals SPACs and I can check. I am not so sure here at the conversation that I am having with SPAC sponsors on how to navigate this choppy market. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yeah. Let's talk CND Circle. I actually have had a few friends who were pinging me on it several months ago, saying, Hey, you should take a look, Circle's going crazy." I don't think I've ever seen a SPAC restrike their deal at a higher valuation. So I'll stop rambling. I'll let you kind of tell the story and why it's so interesting. <br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> I thought it was really interesting, too. I've done calls to the company. My background is in covering financials and Fintech and this was kind of a nice intersection. Even though to be totally clear, a lot of the crypto stuff is way over my head but this was pretty straightforward. It reminded me a lot of a Trust Bank, very rate sensitive. You know what I liked about it as you dug in is they assumed no interest rate hikes in the forecast. So you knew there were a lot of upsides and you could track the USDC issuance and you can see that there was upside to the plan.<br><br>So that got me really excited that you were going to have s SPAC raised numbers because we've talked about that's not so common. And so what was interesting is the common was trading at 1050, which as you know is very good for a SPAC these days. But it's also saying it's a way to say the market thinks this asset is worth 5% more than the deals cut out. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yep.<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Yet, they come in and double the valuation. So I was pretty frustrated again. I spoke to the guys at Circle, I have a lot of respect for them. They felt like they were in a good negotiating position. They had to recut the deal because their timeline with the SPAC was expiring and they apparently just held all the cards. But if you think about it now, they get this nice valuation on paper. They lost the pipe. The stock is now trading below Trust.<br><br>So, it's back in the hands of the arms from the fundamental guys and the setup now just feels like they're going to face high redemptions, and they prior to needing to raise a pipe. So, the question for them will be what term do they raise a pipe? Can they raise it better terms and before even if it's at a discount to the SPAC price? But you take a story that I think was really primed to explode it from a stock standpoint and you make it a lot more challenging. It's one of those businesses and the stock are different. The business is still fine and dandy but could be harder for the stock. <br><br>The other thing they did was they updated their forecast to include the interest rate curve, the forward futures curve, which, obviously, unbeknownst to them, this whole Ukraine issue happened. A lot of global volatility is in turmoil, and now the futures curve is coming down and so, all of a sudden you went from, this is a sure thing beaten raised to now, like, is there a risk? I don't know. It just gets a lot harder. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yeah. <br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> So we'll see how it plans out. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Correct me if I'm wrong, Circle CND took a really long time for them to get their deal done and that's part of the reason why they had to restrike everything. I've seen FTCV which if I remember [crosstalk] is merging with Etoro.<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Etoro.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> And FPAC, which I think is really interesting optionality is merging with [crosstalk] Bullish. <br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Bullish.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Both of them have taken way, way longer than I would have suspected to get their deals done. They're different, right, but all of them loosely touch on crypto. I'm wondering if the SEC is just having big pushback on SPACs that touches on crypto. Do you think I'm reading too much into stock? <br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> No, I think you're exactly right. I've spoken to all 3 of those teams because I've noticed the same thing and they just said "Look, we're working with the SEC, were giving them whatever they need. The SEC apparently hired some crypto guys a couple of months back." So they're educating themselves as well. But FTCV to deal was announced on March 2021, and here we are a year later.<br><br>I've asked the CND guys, "What do you think your deal closes?" They'll all say, "We don't know. We're ready to close now but we're just waiting on the SEC and FPAC Bullish. They'll say the same thing." So, everyone's working really hard. Listen, there's another SPAC, its entry called Queen's Gambit, GMBT. I flag that one for two reasons. One, they've already beaten numbers before pre-deals SPAC and I think that's pretty interesting. But two, they filed and amended f4 last night. It's their fifth draft. And if you do a Redline comparison, there are four changes. <br><br>As far as I'm concerned, and as an investor all immaterial. So the SEC is clearly harping on all SPACs and I would say it's a fair read that crypto even a little bit more. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Is Queen's Gambit touching SPAC? I don't know who they're merging with. Does their merger touch SPACs? Or are you just using that as a general [unintelligible]?<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> You mean crypto or? <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Oh, yes. Sorry. <br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> It's effectively a rideshare app. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Okay.<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Do you remember GVs Via?<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yes, I do remember Via. <br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> So it's like Via but internationally in the Middle East and whatnot. The unit economics are really interesting because unlike Uber where it's like one driver one passenger. They're the drivers that fixed cost and as you drive usage you actually grow your margins. I fly that one because you get my attention if you beat earnings and raised before he dies back because again, this has really happened and they've been able to accomplish that. So I've been trying to understand this back process and when they filed last night, you know, first I saw and learn I was like, "Great. They're going to get their date and go effective and they didn't. But you start flipping through and try to understand what the SCC folk did and you come always scratching your head, "Why are you stopping a deal for...? <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> I was laughing when you said they were merging with an international Via because <br>if you look at the stock price of Uber, or Lyft, or any of the international Uber have left. I think we [inaudible] [laughs] once that goes through.<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Very well could be the difference seems to be that they're so far beating. You look at something like a Grab. Grab really sucks for someone who likes this back world as a whole because it's a quality sponsor, they structure the alignment so it&#180;s well aligned and obviously still, you know, a poor result. I'm not that close to it so I can tell you what is macro versus over-aggressive but it's exactly right. These things have gotten hit. But again, I think the solution for a lot of this back issue is back to come out and beat raised numbers. It's really that simple. I was speaking to a sponsor this week and I said, "Whatever numbers you ultimately go out, with for whatever asset you buy, I would seriously consider cutting them by 10%, having a fight that the valuation is not as cheap but then like during your DS[?] back you being raised a little and you're being raised and you're like all these other beating ray stories that we've seen. <br><br>But I think, there's no way to prove this bull... There is a way, they've all missed. I think a lot of these facts came out in the early '21 and leading to 2021, they had to put out these really aggressive forecasts to justify the valuations and get the deals done. This is probably a good segue. I know you want to talk about these facts. When you report Q4 21 and give your 2022 guy, that really could be declaring event because you've taken your pain, you've divorced yourselves from these ridiculous forecasts that you originally put out and now you may finally have level set expectations to beat and raise and just because you didn't like a stock at 10 doesn't mean you don't have to like it at 4. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yep. No. I'm with you. It's just such a tough balancing act for the stock there, right? Because if you lower the numbers too much the [inaudible] is going to look at you and be like, "Oh, I'm not interested in this back on the announcement because the valuation is too high." And then you beat... It's just a tough game... [crosstalk]<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> They're not interested anyway. Let's be fair right now.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Sure. Sure.<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> But again, you look at deals like [inaudible] Robin's, right? I know that's a high-profile one that people talk about and you've got an asset at a reasonable price, very evened out positive, very free cash flow positive and you're able to look at something like that and say if you do your work and you get comfortable, even if I really like this business and there's volatility around the dish back, they're generating cash, it's real, it's not a concept so, does that mean you should put your entire portfolio into it? Absolutely not. But does that make it easier to own versus some of these other stories? I absolutely think so. <br><br>We should talk about... And full disclosure I'm long CRA issue common and warrants. We should talk about that also because one of the questions that showed up on Twitter was about some of these non-redemption incentives that sponsors are starting to offer. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Let's let's wrap the conversation up there. I think that's a good place to stop. So a lot of sponsors... I can't remember who the first one was but we've seen it increasingly where they'll do... It's similar to talk team structure, right? "Hey, if you own shares and you don't redeem, basically, we've set aside a pool of shares."<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Yup.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> And for every shareholder who doesn't redeem, you'll get one. So if no one redeems, everyone gets 0.1 extra shares, but if half of the people redeem then everyone gets 0.5 extra shares. So it gets up and it really encourages. I've seen that structure so far. I mean, it's been limited. I don't think it's been that successful and discouraging redemption because everybody's been looking at these things and saying, "If the stocks going10 to 6, it doesn't matter if I redeem an extra...<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Exactly.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> What do you think about them? Do you think these are clever? Do you think we'll start seeing more of them? Have you seen them work so far? <br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> We haven't really seen them work but small sample size. There's a deal coming up for both...<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Starry? <br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Story. Exactly. Some have it. The way I think about it is you're not being compensated enough if you're like an ARB[?] who is not fundamental to say, "Oh, you're giving me like an extra 0.1." Let's say 0.1 shares, right? A dollar of consideration. So sure I'll stick around because you look and there are just too many of these things trading that drops immediately.<br>The 7, 6, 5, 4, 3. So I view it as a sweetener if you like the deal. So again in the Conn[?] Robbins case where I like the deal and I like the cash flow characteristics. Sure. If you're going to give me a little extra juice. That sounds good." By the way, the warrants that restrike, too. So I'm going to get more value in my warrants and that's great. If the forecast is close to right... Even if it trades on a little bit, the thing is in a compound value. In my opinion, for these cash regenerating stories, a warrant is just a cheap form of leverage on your cash flow compound. So, in the case of CRHC, a highly profitable business at a reasonable price. So if you like it before the story, then the 6.6 million shares are allocating to [inaudible] of bonus and the warrants being restocked is also a bonus. But it all starts from liking the business and then when you look at Starry. Starry said, "I'm not in the lead, but it sounds like an interesting business could mission to bring cheap internet everywhere. <br><br>But I looked at it and say, "Okay, this business is free cash from negative to the tune of about $350 million over the next 3 years based on their forecasts. That's just not the type of stock that works in this environment, right? As we've seen with people from Origin. So what? Even if the private investors are impressive, you have Tiger, they've got Fidelity but I look at that and say, "You know what? I'm not quite sold on the story here and so offering me the million shares that they're offering to non-redeeming shareholders isn't going to change my mind or get me excited to play." But it would have if I was interested, to begin with.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> I'll just mention for listeners. I just did a deep dive in the cable space and on the blog one of the things I did was I talked about Starry because I think Starry has a really interesting model. If you look at the projections, if you look at their model, it's very scary as a cable investor as a potential but I think Starry runs in some issues where they don't actually own... What they're doing is they're basically leveraging someone else's last mile to go offer internet. Someone and they've got a really novel way but I think there's a lot of questions around that where they don't know the infrastructure. They're the only ones who are trying to do this which should suggest that a lot of other people have some concerns with how [inaudible] is structured but it is a really interesting model. As you said some very smart guys are backing a pipe that is a pretty interesting valuation, right? Actual last question then I'm going to let you go. <br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> All right.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> There are a couple of specs that have rights outstanding right? So rights are kind of similar to warrants where if the deal gets done, the rights slip into a stock. The 2 I'm particularly thinking of are Benne, B-E-N-E. ESSC is the other one. I can't remember what the specs name is. Or are you familiar with either of these? <br><br>Louise: I know Benne because I think it's a Patrick Orlando's back. Is that right? <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yes. Yeah. <br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> And ESSC seems to get a lot of the red attention because it's gotten very low flow. But listen, I think rights in general are... I just had the data point up on where they were ...[crosstalk]<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Let's go to the rights thing in a second. These 2, in particular, I was going to ask because these stocks are around $10 per share and the right switch for both of them. 1/10 of a right becomes a whole share. So, the rights are at about 40 cents. So that implies a stock price of $4. My question to you is going to be, similar to the warrants, are the rights forecasting to stocks going straight down if the deals got approved, or are they forecasting to, "Hey, there's a big chance that the SEC blocks, these deals or the deals fall apart because if these facts can get a deal through, rights are worth to zero. So how would you read into this rights price these days? <br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> I mean can the answer be yes to both?<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> It can be.<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Right now the median rights for a pre-announcements back is 2 bucks. Normalized pretend so it's implying a 2-dollar stock price. Your point is exactly right. This either means that a lot of them are going to liquidate, or it means that the stocks are going to tank. I think from the perspective of doing a deal if they're only rights and no warrants to some extent, that could be easier, right? Because at times they look at it as delusion and so I think it's hard. What I like more about warrants is you get more of that upside but on a situational basis, the rights could be interesting. So I'll be specific. There's a SPAC called ROC Energy. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Okay.<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> So these guys went out, they did their IPO, no warrants, but they did a right. The reason they did that is they said, "Look, we want to buy an energy asset that pays a big dividend, and as you may or may not know if you pay a dividend over 50 cents it restrikes the warrant.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> And we've seen a lot of SPACs with warrants have to come out and amend the warrants because of exactly that issue.<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Yeah. So they said, "Well, we want to get ahead of that and so no warrant just a right.<br>I actually think that's an interesting structure and by the way, Energy could be an interesting asset class for his back right now, since Energy has been out of vogue for years, and all of a sudden it's... [crosstalk]<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Very in vogue now.<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> So I actually think that... And full disclosure. I own those units. Actually, that one could be interesting but there are a lot of other ones where they're issuing rights because they have to keep giving goodies to investors. So, you look at some of these deals that have overfunded trust plus warrants, plus rights. There was an interesting deal that actually showed alignment. I know we're over here. So I'm going to try to find this fast for you. But there's this SPAC with the ticker BLEU. What they did here is they issued rights so they wouldn't have to over-fund the trust which could have just been a capital issue for the sponsor.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yep.<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Well, what the sponsor did to offset that is they temporarily forfeited some of their promote unless the stock is above whatever the number is 1250, 15 bucks. So, if you're an investor or the target company, you know that there's no incremental delusion here unless the stock is up 25% plus, and then candidly no one cares. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yeah.<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> So if they're creative structures like that, I think that's okay but in a lot of the other cases, it just feels like right or kind of last in the line of goodies too sweet and IPO so you should be careful. But if it's only rights, it's okay. If it's not only rights, you could be wrong.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Perfect. Louis, I think we covered so much on this podcast. It's great having you on. Congratulations on your launch.<br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Thank you.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Hopefully a couple of months from now, we can come to an update on Origin. They'll be close to getting plant one online. We can do an update on the stock market and hopefully, things are a little more lively than they are today. It's great having you on, congrats on your launch and we'll talk soon. <br><br><strong>Louis:</strong> Thanks, Andrew. I appreciate the time.

It was a labor of love and very related to my day job (which includes a huge investment in cable!), so I&#8217;m not looking for your pity on my efforts.

The next company I&#8217;m doing is Regneron (REGN); I&#8217;ve already done the expert calls for them, and that post should be out in the next few weeks. But I haven&#8217;t chosen a target beyond that; again, <strong>if you&#8217;ve got suggestions or ideas for companies or sectors I should do this on, please lob them in</strong>.

Again, despite all the warnings, the ETF didn&#8217;t really drop until the Russians actually went into Ukraine. </p><ul><li><p><strong>My takeaway: </strong>This reminds me of COVID back in Feb. 2020. If you were paying attention, you knew there were huge risks, yet the market barely had sold off and vol was low. One thing I&#8217;m going to be pressing myself harder on hoing forward: when there&#8217;s a situation with a big tail (either upside or downside) and the market has barely moved, I&#8217;m going to look harder. My instincts are always &#8220;o, that&#8217;s down 5%; it&#8217;s priced in.&#8221; But here we&#8217;ve got two earth shattering global events (COVID and the Ukraine invasion), and the market clearly hadn&#8217;t priced them correctly until the world was actually in the throes of the crisis.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Second</strong>, it&#8217;s a reminder that anything can go to zero overnight. I know that seems trite, but it&#8217;s easy to forget the world has massive tail risk. RSX just shows it to me a little more; I mean, an entire country&#8217;s ETF going down 50% in five days! I know that you take that type of risk with emerging markets, but to see it happen in real time is a powerful reminder.</p><ul><li><p><strong>My takeaway: </strong>I&#8217;ve been particularly thinking about this as it relates to China. I haven&#8217;t done much investing in China (a few small special situations) for a variety of reasons, but the rapid drop in RSX makes me think about the chances we have that happen in China one day.</p></li><li><p>You can apply that thinking to domestic stocks too. Lots of people (including me sometimes) like to look at a stock and say &#8220;well, it&#8217;s at $25; if things go wrong it trades to $20, if they go right it goes to $40. $15 up, $5 down for a 3:1 risk/reward.&#8221; That can be a useful framework, but this is a reminder that the downside is always zero in a tail case!</p></li><li><p>It&#8217;s also a reminder that things can go way, way worse than you expect quickly, and your money is always at 100% risk in the stock market. Think of all the companies that have reported earnings this year and seen their stocks drop &gt;20%; the second you put capital at risk in the market, all your money is instantly at risk. I can&#8217;t tell you the number of times I&#8217;ve taken a small position and said &#8220;looks like a good risk / reward; I&#8217;ll put a little on and keep ramping up&#8221; and watched the position get cut in half in no time. Maybe it suggests I shouldn&#8217;t be putting those small positions on (though there have been some that really worked too!), but just a reminder that small speculations can really add up if they get crushed and they absolutely can!</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Third</strong>, I know a lot of people who &#8220;bought the dip&#8221; on RSX last week and have gotten slaughtered. I&#8217;m not here to dunk on them; Lord knows I&#8217;ve made worse trades! Plus, it&#8217;s still early; it&#8217;s never fun to be down 50% on a position, and it&#8217;s hard to see a way this snaps back to break even or better in the short term, but it&#8217;s possible! Anyway, not trying to dunk on anyone, but I do think that a lot of people who bought the &#8220;Russia dip&#8221; had very similar political and world views that probably skewed them to believing Russia would be a winner in all this because their leaders are &#8220;strong&#8221; and the West&#8217;s leaders are &#8220;weak&#8221; / not trusting what the Western world was telling them. We all bring our own biases into every investment we make or action we take, but the Russia situation was probably a little more overt than normal and the quick initial drop fog of uncertainty probably exasperated it in this case (If something&#8217;s down 20% in a day, it&#8217;s way more tempting to quickly give in to biases and say &#8220;buy now before it snaps back!&#8221;; if something&#8217;s down 20% over a few months, it&#8217;s easier to take it slow, think things through, and do lots of work on it because you don&#8217;t feel that same pressure that the thing is going to snap back instantly).</p><ul><li><p><strong>My takeaway: </strong>I&#8217;m certainly not a political or macro expert; maybe you are. But if you&#8217;re not, don&#8217;t trade on macro / politics. And, if you are, make sure you&#8217;re actually trading macro / politics, and not just buying into what your political believes are. And if something down huge in a day, it might be a sign to step back and think the situation through a little further, not quickly buy the dip before it snaps back!</p></li><li><p>I think something similar could apply to big drops in stocks you own. A lot of time, the instinct is &#8220;this is an irrational panic; buy the dip!&#8221; Sometimes that works out&#8230;. but maybe big drops should be met with a &#8220;I can&#8217;t trade this for 48 hours; I need to coolly recollect my thoughts and reassess this position.&#8221; IDK, I can see an argument for both sides (I&#8217;m assuming you&#8217;ve already done tons of work on the company, so you could argue you should know exactly where the market is wrong on a big drop, or that you really do need to go back to the drawing board and reassess).</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Anyway, nothing new here, but good reminders. I&#8217;ve been tihnking about it with my own portfolio recently. I run reasonably concentrated, but I&#8217;ve got a few smaller event trades. One of them is<a href="https://yetanothervalueblog.substack.com/p/starting-the-year-with-some-forced?utm_source=url"> NTP, which I wrote up earlier this year.</a> The stock had gotten hammered when I wrote it up, and I put a small position on thinking it was from forced selling and &#8220;the bottom was in.&#8221; Guess what? Since then, things have gotten worse, and the stock is down &gt;30%. Obviously, that could change, and there&#8217;s a lot of asset value at NTP if shareholders are allowed to realize it, but I can&#8217;t help but look at the fact pattern and know that I was attracted to NTP only because of the quick drop / forced selling angle.</p><ul><li><p>And the funny thing is: this could all be recency bias when saying &#8220;think slow&#8221;. When<a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewRangeley/status/1498327067317915657?s=20&amp;t=G5EdDNlgTUwq7LJcS7-NYw"> I tweeted this out as a thought bubble</a>, several readers pointed out (and I remembered!) of several examples where the right answer was not &#8220;act slow&#8221; but &#8220;the market is way under reacting to this; buy / sell everything now!&#8221; </p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Bottom line: </strong>Investing is hard.</p></li></ul><p><strong>A mini-rant / you can tell someone to go to hell tmr</strong></p><ul><li><p>One of the most frustrating things about having a (small) public presence is the negative feedback you get from random strangers. Every now and then, I&#8217;ll do a post on a company and I&#8217;ll get an email from someone that says "&#8220;I don&#8217;t care about that company; never mention them again.&#8221; It&#8217;s just so frustrating; these are random strangers who are reading free content that they voluntarily signed up for and they&#8217;re telling me what to write (or not write) about. </p></li><li><p>Anyway, my temptation is always to tell them to go to hell. But, a quick reminder for both myself and any readers out there who find themselves in a similar situation: you can always tell someone to go to hell tomorrow. The internet is a big place.

Hello and welcome to Yet Another Value Podcast. I'm your host, Andrew Walker. And with me today, I'm excited to have the original guest of the podcast. The most frequent guest of the broadcast. My friend, Jeremy Raper. Jeremy, how's it going? <br><br><strong>Jeremy Raper</strong>: Great, mate. What episode am I up to now, 6, 7, somewhere in there? <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> You know, I was wondering this afternoon, I think it's six. It could be seven. I need to keep track. I'll start labeling the podcast. Like I keep track of what number of podcasts. Well, if everyone else podcast, then what Jeremy Raper's podcast. Just to keep your hand up[?]. <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Did you get any feedback saying that random Australian guy's been away too many times, stop getting him back?<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> No. You're one of the most popular guests. I tweet out that you're coming on, and the inbox fills up and they say, "Hey, have him talk about every name in his book. Have him tell us what we should do with our life. You're a popular guy. <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Good to hear. Well, I'm what can I say? I like to solve problems. That's what I do. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Let me start this podcast the way do like every podcast. First, disclaimer, I remind everyone nothing on this podcast investing advice, probably particularly true today. I think Jeremy and I are going to talk about his latest activism play, but we also might talk about some other stocks. And Jeremy traffics in the E-liquid, the international, the unknown. So, just please consult a financial advisor. Do your own due diligence. The second way, I start every podcast is a pitch for you my guest but we already did the pitch six-time on the podcast. If that doesn't speak to you, I don't know what is. <br><br>So let's just dive right into it. You're running another activist campaign. I think the last time we had you on or maybe two times ago, was kind of your first activist campaign over at Hunter Douglas, which worked out. Seemingly, I'll let you kind of recount the full story, if you want to. But the contest you're running right now; not a contest, but the plays you're applying pressure is FAR Limited. The ticker is F-A-R (FAR), it trades in Australia. And all that all the way, I'll toss it over to you. What's going on with FAR? <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Sure. Thanks very much. So, yes, okay. So I'll try and keep it as brief and as succinct, and up-to-date as possible, because this is quite has a long and interesting corporate history that's a company, but I'm not sure all of it is entirely relevant to what's going on today. But in a nutshell, FAR is as you mentioned Australian listed as Small-Cap Oil and Glass Explorer. And when I say small-cap, it is a small-cap. I think the market cap today is about 65 million Aussie. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yep.<br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> They have just over 100 million net assets. As I mentioned, a very interesting in toward a history of exploration, mostly in West Africa. Mostly with poor success. However, they did kind of strike a huge find in Senegal, a very long time ago. Over a decade ago, they found the original oil field that would later become the Sangomar S-A-N-G-O-M-A-R. Sangomar development project, which is frankly, one of the world's great oil discoveries in recent years and has been progressively advanced from discovery to development, to probably first oil production in 2023. <br><br>Unfortunately, now under different ownership will talk about that. But essentially, I mean, just by way of context, this is a very small company. There are lots of companies like this in Australia. I mean, it's kind of like Canada. There are kind of a dime and dozen junior, junkie, small-cap oil, and gas or mining exploration plays[?] with varying degrees of management quality and varying degrees of exploration assets. <br><br>What makes FAR interesting today is that, unlike say, 9 out of 10 of those other types of plays listeners Australian probably most in Canada too. You have something real and tangible on the balance sheet. And that is a whole bunch of cash and extremely valuable deep in the money earning out from Woodside. <br><br>Woodside being a very large Aussie operator, the largest oil and gas producer in Australia, a 30 billion-dollar company. Which bought the Sangomar assets from FAR and it's the operator today and is essentially going to pay them in earn-out if production comes online and oil prices stay at certain levels over the next few years. We'll talk about that.<br><br>But just to frame the overall valuation case first, was I think this is important. So basically, net cash on the balance sheet today, net of all remaining obligations and basically with an accrual for costs in 2022 and probably longer than that. I think is about 45 to 50 censorship. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yep. <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Okay. Then the value of the...<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Hey, Jeremy, I'll stop you there. As we speak now, we can talk about how this FAR[?] first got here because it's interesting in its own right. But as we speak, the stock is around 65, 66 cents Aussie. So when you say 45 to 50%, it's not the entire share price, but it is a lot of the share price just to give you a little background[?].<br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Exactly. The stock price today is 66 cents Aussie, 45 cents-ish 45 to 50 cents, depending on your burned down assumptions on what happens with the corporate overhead and other things like that. Is it cap-backed by cash? And then you have this Woodside earn-out. Now, the Woodside earn-out is up to 55 million U.S. dollars. It's a contingent payment, right? <br><br>So it's up to 55 million U.S. dollars total based upon FAR's share of run reproduction. Once the Sangomar assets reach the first production, which is slated to be in mid-2023. So call it a year from today, maybe slightly longer than a year from today. And essentially what that means is you look at Forex original stake in the Sangomar assets before they sold Woodside, which was 13.7%. <br><br>Then you look at what Woodside is saying, phase one production will be which they're saying up to 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. Then, you calculate the value that 13.7 percent, let's say a hundred thousand barrels a day, multiplied by the annual production, multiplied by the excess value. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> I was told there wasn't going to be a lot of math here, Jeremy. <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Sorry. I know. Let's just put it this way. It adds up to about 25, 26 million U.S. dollars a year based on the metrics that would side has disclosed in U.S. dollars from the first production. So for example, if you think the field comes online in mid-2023 then from mid-2023 through mid-2024 assuming they produce around a hundred thousand barrels a day, FAR would be entitled to about 25 million dollars in arrear. So from mid-2024, they'd be getting 25 million. And then the year after that, they'd be getting another 26, 27 million. <br><br>So it is essentially from two full years of production they could get the full earn-out if oil prices stay where they are. So the maximum oils price trigger is $70 Brent, $70 Brent per barrel. And right now, the price of Brent is $100 a barrel. Importantly, the futures curve of Brent is not[?] of serving at all as a barrel for 2024 and last I checked, 2025. I need to check. <br><br>So the oil futures curve is in backwardation, basically, saying current prices are very high. They'll come down in the future as supply comes online or there's a shortage right now in the market, but my point is the oil futures curve is very liquid. You can easily hedge this out. If you wanted to make a bit on 2025 oil prices and "lock in those prices", you could do that today. So the earn-out is risky in the sense that or would say has to execute in RAM production.<br><br>But we're not talking about five years forward. We're talking about the near term, as it gets for a new potentially massive oil field. And that's evidenced by, I mean, the valuation of this thing before they were even thinking of selling it, right? So if you think about it, sorry. I should recap the valuation case before we talk about the event path because that frames everything else. So just take me at face value for now that the Woodside earn-out is worth some NPV number off that 55 million. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yep.<br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Because oil prices have deep in the money and because it's not too far and production, it's coming online in 12 to 15 months. And then, you have quite a long window of observation. You have three years from the first oil, up until the 2027 hard date. So, assuming even some incremental delays, you still have a three-year period to get your money from whenever you first of all start. <br><br>And if there are any periods of zero production or kind of hiccups, those don't count. So we can debate the NPV of that number. But if oil prices stay as they are, maybe it takes 2-3 years. Maybe it takes an extra year. You're probably going to get close to 55 million U.S. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> And how much of that for sure?<br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Yeah. So 55 million U.S. divided by the exchange rate today is 71, 72, it's as much as mid 70 cents per share gross. Now, of course, you have to NPV that because you wouldn't be entitled if you tried to cash it in today, you got an NPV. So then you have this argument about discount rates. I use a 10% discount rate. As I said, there's no price risk at the moment. There's very minimal price risk, but there is execution risk.<br><br>The 10% discount rate makes it worth about 55 cents a share. Slightly higher actually, maybe I got like 57 cents a share, some of that. The company... Yeah.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> At this point, no. Go ahead.<br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> I was going to say, the company is fighting off a takeover bid at the moment, and in their documentation, they said it was worth, I think 50, 55, 50, a very similar number because there are third-party values or came up with a very similar discount rate. It was a 9.5 to 9 to 10% discount rate they got to as well. And that's a bit of fudge. I mean not a swag type math, but there's a way of estimation in these things.<br><br>But Woodside is, as I said, a premium operator, no note, no credit risk. Completely the best quality counterparty you could have, equivalent to BHP or whatever. Near-term production, they're the operator of the asset, huge financial commitment to developing this asset. As I said, this is a multi-billion dollar project, right? <br><br>Before this project was sold down by FAR, they were saying their NPV 10 of their own 14% stake back in mid-2019 when they did the original financing for the development of the field, there are 13% required funding cash call. They said the NPV 10 at the time was 540 million U.S. dollars for 13%. And that was with crude Brent at 60, 65 dollars a barrel. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yep. <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> So my point is this is not some hundred-million-dollar project. At today's oil prices, this is at least a 10 billion dollar project. To Woodside, this is a huge value creation opportunity. And the earn-out to Woodside is totally and utterly immaterial. Like there's no risk that they would slow play this project because they don't want to pay 550 million dollars. I mean, this is a...<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> And people who listen to the podcast for a long time, we'll remember the Bristol-Myers CVRs where they managed to slowly climb. There's been some interest in court filings there. But yeah, like if it's a 9 billion dollar liability slow play it. If it's a 55 million dollar liability for a 10 billion dollar asset, you're probably not going to slow play. Especially it's not like if they delayed by a month, they're going to get out of it, right? There's this huge window of time. So you might as well just get that thing producing. <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> That's exactly right. They couldn't get out of it even if they slow-played it by a year or two. I mean you may as well just try to maximize value. And again, we're only talking Phase 1, right? This is meant to be part of a larger system in production that should not stop at 100,000 barrels a day. It should continue to grow through investment from there. So, for Woodside I mean, we can talk about what happened and how they even came to this asset. But essentially, they are coming out well ahead. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> So we've got 45 cents per share in cash, NPV 55 cents -ish of the earn-out here. So, I mean, right there were at a dollar per-share value. Anything else we need to consider when we're valuing this thing? <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Sure. So that's a dollar right there. I mean, in my numbers, I was slightly north of a dollar more like a dollar 6.7, but whatever. Call it a dollar, that's what the company said. And then, they have all their hodgepodge of remaining oil drilling licenses. And so, look, I don't accord much value currently to those just because they did drill on some of the wells in The Gambia. The Gambia is right next to Senegal in West Africa. All their assets are in this West African pocket Senegal The Gambia Guinea-Bissau.<br><br>But anyway, they had a massive failure of one of their exploration wells. It was a complete disaster in their Gambier assets that they had spent 27, 28 million U.S. dollars on. So think about that, this company at that time it even a sub 100 million market cap company spending 28, 30 million U.S. dollars on one single exploration, which was delivered over budget by 10 million U.S. dollars. <br><br>Anyway, that was a failure and didn't find any commercial movable oil. Although they did say, they found hydrocarbons, great. The point is, they have that, that's their 50% share. They're also the operator. The other 50% is owned by Petronas, which is Malaysia's state-owned oil company.<br><br>And then, they have some other blocks of potential interest in Guinea-Bissau, which haven't been drilled in many years where their partner is a small Norwegian company called PetroNor that also doesn't have the money to drill those wells. And then, they have one tiny Australian asset. There's essentially worthless. So look, I mean...<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Let's put them all together. Just kind of bundle all those up. What do you think there's a roughly where[?]? <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> In my model at the moment, nothing. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Nothing. Okay. <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Yeah. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> So dollar per share a value, current share price about 65 cents. And then there's probably some other optionality in there. <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Yeah, there's optionality. Right? I have nothing in it now, but there could be optionality that is very valuable to a large long-term investing state oil champion like Petronas that frankly, we as small shareholders in a company like FAR should not be valuing but Petronas may well be interested in owning these huge potential results[?]. <br><br>So, for example, let's forget about Guinea-Bissau. And frankly, I don't think that's worth very much either. It's in a much more difficult geography. Guinea-Bissau had a coup attempt earlier this year. He's had three or four coups in the last 12 years. And apparently, an exploration well was meant to be drilled there as FAR back as 2015, '16, they didn't drill anything. So they're also not an operator. FAR is not an operator there. <br><br>So basically, they've already stated, they're trying to farm down their interest there. So, that farm down means, accepting a lower interest in the upside from development in return for, I guess not having to pay for the exploration well, right?<br><br>If we just focus on The Gambia, which before this recent disaster of a well, FAR was saying contain hundreds of millions potentially a billion barrels of oil in some of these discoveries, right? So huge, huge numbers and then I came up dry. Apparently, there's a path forward if you listen to FAR. I'm quite skeptical and dubious, especially given the history, but if that is so, why shouldn't we talk to Petronas and pinch potentially try to monetize at stake, right?<br><br>Let them take the development risk. And enjoy the upside and let us get out with some token amount to be determined, which would be de minimis for Petronas in, essentially, meaningless. But for FAR shareholders, currently with as I said, 50 million, 45, 50 million U.S. dollar market cap, a 20 million dollar check. Ten, 20 million dollars is a huge, huge kind of upside optionality. So, I mean, that's one of the platforms of my approach which I intend to pursue, we can talk about that. <br><br>But to summarize the evaluation case, 45 to 50 cents of net cash was unaffected. Call at 55 cents of NPV in the Woodside earn-out. And then, maybe something worth another 20, 30 cents if things break our way. But the key point is, this is an unaffected value. Unaffected meaning without core financial engineering. And the point is, the company is sitting on today, 50 cents of cash with the stock trading at 65 cents, okay.<br><br>And the company says, our shares are worth at least a dollar share, and the market it's been very liquid, stocks up a bit. But I think 20, 25 percent of the company has traded between 45 cents and 65 cents in the last month. Instead of spending this excess cash on further drilling adventures, a key part of my platform is to do something FAR more creative for shareholders and that is tender to retire a huge amount of stock. <br><br>Something close to the current price because yeah, it's a dollar per share if we leave things as is and just proceed to a wind-down. But if we actually retire a bunch of the flow, let's say, 75, 80, 85 cents, you can add another 20, 25, 30%. You're upside just through Efficient Capital Management. So all of a sudden, I'll let you speak in a minute. <br><br>But all of a sudden instead of getting a dollar value, we're getting a dollar 30 of value simply through efficient capital allocation. Like no exploration risk. No aggressive kind of Capex, no kind of operational risk at all. Simply through astute management. And so, that's something that is kind of a sine qua non of my investment thesis, and my kind of activist platform is what are we doing here? We should be doing a massive Dutch tender at its lowest prices possible. This is like ripe for the picking. Anyway, you had a number of questions. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Now, look I think you did a great job laying out the numbers there. But one of the things is you said the surge that there are a lot of stocks, a lot of oil and gas, explorers. A lot of Biotech companies are trading below cash or something, right? You're trading way below hard asset value. The issue is, the market is putting a chance that the company is just never going to return that cash to shareholders. They're just going to keep drilling. Keep drilling into all the cash is gone. <br><br>I want to talk about what attracted you to the situation, and then talk about why. I think you published, I can't remember. It was a news article or your letter but you said, "Hey, I own about 1.5 percent of this company and I'm pushing for change here." So maybe we can start with the situation and then go, you pretty much already laid out your platform. Buyback shares when they're undervalued, and milk this thing.<br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Sure. Look, as you said, there are lots of cheap stocks in the world. I mean, this is kind of analogous to what I'm used to in Japan, right? You have very readily identifiable value, right. A bunch of cash, a bunch of securities are very deep in the money earn-out, right? And then, a bunch of people sitting in control. You come to the gate, you see behind the gate there's a bunch of treasure. The problem is, there's an ogre in front of the gate, and the ogre is not going to roll over and get out of the way, and that's the problem. <br><br>The problem is extracting the value. So, what's really interesting in this case is that, not only do I think it's possible to extract the value, I think it's almost inevitable. So let's look at the sequence of events. Okay. So this company was on the cusp of catapulting itself from being an unknown junior to being truly a large, mid-cap to larger Oil Company, purely based on its 14% stake in Sangomar. <br><br>As I said, on the books at NPV 10, 500 million-plus back with oil at 65, if they had, simply been able to maintain that stake and meet their funding calls, this would be a multi-billion dollar company today. So what happened? I'll try to keep it as brief as possible. But essentially, like all oil discoveries, it's generally a club affair, right? It's a JV with various ownership stakes. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yep. <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> FAR had been and always was a small and junior player. And then, they originally the large ownership stake was owned by ConocoPhillips. And another ownership stake was owned by Caron[?] Energy, the UK Energy company. Conoco decided to sell out their interest, I think it was in 2016. At the time, I think they were 35, 40% and they were also the operator. Okay, they sold that interest to Woodside as mentioned. <br><br>So Woodside went from zero came into the project. They saw the potential. They came in as a significant owner. If not, they weren't the largest in a bit of significant owner and operator. At the time FAR exercised, well, FAR claimed that move was against the JV agreement because they were not offered a preemption right on that cell. So in other words, it's pretty common in JVs that if you're an existing partner in the JV, if one of the JV partners wants to sell out, everyone else in the JV gets first, right to be on it[?]. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yep. <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Now at the time, FAR was still a rinky-dink tiny "shit goat" with no money. So they didn't have the money to even come close to bidding on the 35% stake in this field. Whatever Woodside paid, I'd have to look it up hundreds of millions of dollars. Nevertheless, the current managing director kicked up a huge fuss, tried to take Woodside to court. Went to arbitration. Arbitration extended for a very long period of time. <br><br>It extended so long that even though Woodside eventually did close on the transaction and won their case in arbitration, it precluded FAR from being able to raise enough capital expeditiously to fund their cash calls when the time came to make the payments because covid happened. Okay. <br><br>So while Covid happened, they had not finalized all their funding arrangements, FAR that is. And as a result, they were kind of caught short shrift, because they have done an equity financing of north[?] of 200 million Aussie. But that was going to be backed up with 350 million U.S. dollars of senior debt and potentially a junior piece of debt as well. Because their portion of the cash calls to get Sangomar to the first production were close to 500 million dollars.<br><br>Now, because of the ongoing arbitration, this is what I think, they had been unable to raise that debt financing well in advance, right? So, instead of raising that debt financing say, 18 months in advance of needing to pay the money. All of a sudden they were trying to raise that debt financing six months in advance of needing to pay the money or less, and then Covid happened. <br><br>Yes, Covid was a piece of bad luck, obviously, but that lack of astute management that decision to enter arbitration, the basis on which was questionable, and the financial consequences of wish you had no ability to finance anyway, was in effect to the downfall of this company. Because it forced them then during Covid to sell to Woodside at cents on the dollar. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yep. <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Now, that in itself is another story, but essentially, that was the point. That's the key lesson or the key outcome here is. Because they couldn't meet their cash calls to keep their stake in the project they became a forced seller[?]. Once they were a forced seller, their kind of wolves are at the door. But even then, they made other mistakes. For example, they then engaged a further third party, an Indian oil company called ONGC, and decided to sell their stake. <br><br>Theoretically, with 540 million U.S. dollars at NPV 10 with 65 dollars a barrel, they decided to sell it for 110 million dollars. It was 45 million dollars plus reimbursement for some Capex, which ended up being a hundred the total price ended up being 126, but the headline number was 111 at the time. In other words, an 80% discount NPV 10. To be fair, this was in late 2020, basically, so oil prices had gone negative and then rebounded. <br><br>So all prices at the time, were 45, 50 dollars a barrel. So that's 165. So that NPV 10 number is basically, I'm saying that needs to be discounted fair. But again, why are you negotiating with the true third party who has no knowledge and no involvement in the JV? And when you know and as has been proven that Woodside has the right to come in and take any transaction you agree upon. Which is essentially what they did. So I got maybe you want to jump in here. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yeah, I think that was a good job. So I think at this point you've shown, hey this company was mismanaged historically. Maybe ethically, mismanaged. Though they obviously cope[?] with their arrangement[?]. But they're trading for less than they're pretty hard NPV for firm assets. Trading for less than firm assets is been mismanaged historically. <br><br>Let's fast-forward to kind of the news article that happened a few weeks ago that spikes your interest of the company.<br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Sure. So mismanagement historically, as you said, trading a big discount NPV forced to sell their core asset at cents on the dollars through self-inflicted mistakes. Let's say, and then I'm sorry, I need to include one further detail before the news article because it's quite important. As I mentioned, they raised a bunch of money from the equity markets in 2019 to fund their cash calls on Sangomar in two different transactions. <br><br>May 2019 and December 2019, they raised a total of 203 million Aussie. In both of those presentations, if you look at the investment decks, use of proceeds to get Sangomar for the first production. Yeah, they've had other corporate purposes. But essentially, this is infrastructure investment. This is not drilling. This is not wildcatting. <br><br>This is not exploration. This is to fund a share infrastructure costs to get a proven oil discovery to first production. In other words, their share of the FPSO. FPSO is a very expensive piece of the oil platform, essentially. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yep.<br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Yeah. That is extremely expensive. You need to build that. You need to build the oil pipeline that's going to tie into the FPSO from the actual discovery. These were very expensive and they have to fund their share of that. That was the stated use of proceeds for over 200 million dollars of invested capital. <br><br>Then all of a sudden, they're forced to sell that one asset for which that money was intended to be spent. And instead of returning said 200 million dollars, they decided we're not going to return anything and only after that existing shareholders cause a huge fuss. Do they decide to return 80 million dollars? Eighty out of the 203? <br><br>Complete and utter disregard for shareholders rights, frankly, because their money was raised based on infrastructure investment. Now, they're saying no we have a right to go and spend it as we say best fit on something completely different. I mean, it's essentially saying imagine if you were a horse and buggy manufacturer and you say we're going to expand our production of horse and buggy's. <br><br>And then a fire happens. The horse and buggy were house burns down. You take all that money and say, you know what, we're going to go invest in railroads. I mean, that's how different it is. Oil exploration versus infrastructure. I mean, that in itself was not just bad management, that was almost dishonest. Frankly, I'm happy to use that word, [unintelligible] almost dishonest. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> I'm just laughing because you know, you're preaching to the choir over here. I 100% agree with you. But at the same time, I mean, you've seen it a hundred times, right management. Management never wants to return the cash to shareholders once they've raised it. <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> You do see it a lot, especially in the junior oil and gas company. But again, going back to your point, what drew my interest in a situation is, this did promote some change. So, after the last AGM, so June 2021, July, 2021, the old board was turfed. They returned 80 million dollars, a number of the Legacy directors, but not the managing director. Miss Norman, who's been there for a decade. We'll talk about her shortly. <br><br>A number of the entire board got turfed. She remained. Two new directors came on board. So all the comments I've made, frankly, are not really related to those two new directors. They've only been there for seven months, let's say.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yep.<br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> They're regarded to Legacy Management of the company. I want to make that very clear. But so there was some board renewal. They did return a million dollars, but nevertheless they kept going with this well. We want to continue drilling the prospects. For example, we have The Gambia, the one that just failed, that was drilled after the Sangomar asset sales. That's different. <br><br>But what drew me to the case, was about a month ago, an Aussie investment fund called Samuel Terry Asset Management, they call it STAM, just as an abbreviation. They bought 5% of the company, 4.9% and launched a takeover bid at 45 cents. Stock at the time was about 40. I mean it was almost a no premium bid. Maybe it was 5 cent per year.<br><br>And so, I had followed it peripherally on and off before then, but I wasn't really close to it. But you know, that bid made it quite clear what they wanted to do. Right? I mean, their cost basis was 40 cents. Essentially, 35 to 40 cents. And these are pure financial buyers. These aren't oil guys, but deep value guys based in Australia. They put in a bid for the whole company, saying, we want to get at least 50.1%, which is important. Meaning they want control. Once you have 50.1%, you have corporate and board control. You can essentially do whatever you want with the company.<br><br>Because that meant essentially they're going to try and wind the thing down. And basically buy it for 45 cents and get the dollar plus of value, as I kind of outline. So they're at 4.9%, they bid. That forces the company to come back and defend why that's inadequate bid. And as I mentioned, the company's putouts what's called a target statement where they say, look we're worth at least a dollar share.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> And we're taping this. What's today? Like I can't remember I did. <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Today is the 25.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> We're taking this video the 24th, I think the target statement came out yesterday, February 23rd?<br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> It came out either yesterday, or the day before, couple of days ago. But anyway, the Samuel Terry Asset Management bid seems quite unlikely to succeed. Just given where the stock price is, but I mean, in terms of platform, I think they're kind of analogous with what, again to be clear, I have no discussions with them and I am not a concert party of STAM. <br><br>But their platform for the forward look of the company is very similar. I imagine to what I would look to do and that essentially manages this thing in an orderly wind-down scenario and or strategic alternative scenario for the best value for shareholders. <br><br>And so, what really interested me was that because that led to a changing of the register, right? So 45 cent bid stocks are mainly trades 47, 50 cents. Obviously, that captures my interest. I bought all my shares in the 50s, but a huge amount of the float turned over a huge amount, 20% plus. And every day, the float continues to trade and my point to the company is look, you may have thought you had a mandate from shareholders for more drilling.<br><br>Post this standard[?] that is patently not clear because at least a quarter of the company is now essentially a vote for Capital return and maybe wind up. So your previous mandate has long been abrogated or relinquished. And shareholders simply want something new, they want a new direction. And so, I speak to a lot of shareholders in my position and I've acquired 1.5 percent of the company. I believe I've spoken with is in excess of 30% of the register. <br><br>And I'm going to try and speak with more. And I've had a lot of inbound since my letter went out as well. So maybe even 35% of the company would broadly support the kind of agenda that I'm setting forth. And that is essentially, an orderly windup of the company's affairs and return of all capital in the most expeditious form to shareholders. As I said, a very large tender would accomplish that but there are other avenues as well.<br><br>Negotiate with Woodside to crystallize the value of the earn-out in advance. And again, there's ways and mechanisms to do that. But essentially, what I'm offering is some kind of return of total value in it. Well, in excess of a dollar share, which again is the company promulgated number. But the company promulgated number is kind of interesting because that's a static theoretical number where they'd say, it's worth a dollar including 50 cents of cash. <br><br>But then, they want to continue spending that cash on drilling. So, it's kind of a habit both ways number. It's a have-your-cake- and-eat-it-too number. That's not really a dollar value unless we can get the value enough in shareholders pockets expeditiously, which is what I plan to do. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> So, let's just summarize what we've got at this point. So, the company has about a dollar per share and asset value plus a little bit of extra optionality. A couple of months ago, STAM comes and mobs in it. The stocks ready way under that value, probably because people think they're going to go drill a lot of dry wells, but trading way underneath it, STAM lobs in a 45 cent bid, which is, "Hey, we'll pay you for the cash on the balance sheet and we'll take everything else and then we'll liquidate this make a big profit ourselves."<br><br>The company rejects that, but stock trades through the offer. You come in buy up 1.5 percent and, correct me if I'm wrong, you are running a platform here. You're going activist, you're trying to replace board members and get your holders to vote on. Hey, let's get some board members, who will follow this pretty easy plan, right? Stocks at 66 start tendering at 72, tendering at 78, 82. Keep on tendering until you retire all the shares and then liquidate the proceeds to ever remains.<br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Essentially, yes. I should clarify, I have not put forth a board slate yet. So I just to be completely clear on where I stand today. Certainly, my go-forward plan is to engage more actively to take potential board control of this company through some shape or form. But again, just to kind of clarify the rules. So in Australia, you need to be a 5% shareholder to call an EGM an Extraordinary General Meeting. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yep. <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> At which meeting you could propose a variety of resolutions. For example, replacing directors. The directors are the ones who had replaced the managing director. So it's a bit of a two-step process. The first thing to do would be to propose your own slate of directors to achieve board control. And then, and that board would essentially replace the managing director. <br><br>Assuming the current board doesn't come around and see things my way, which that's a TBD. Frankly, again, all my comments on the historical mismanagement of the company relate to the current managing director and the legacy board, not the two new board members. Who as I said very new and obviously, I'm very happy and willing to work with them to achieve the best outcome for everyone involved. <br><br>The only thing is I just don't have anything concrete right now that I can disclose as with regards my own board slate, I can't say that I do. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> I shouldn't have said a word I say, but I guess that what you're saying is hey, I own 1.5 % of this company. I have talked to him for a group. But I've talked to another 30% of shareholders. And the board can go look at their stock price. It was 40 cents before the bid. It's at 65 cents now, like the stock was saying, hey, you're going to light a lot of cash on fire before this. <br><br>Now, the stock market, so you say, hey, we like that we might get our cashback and they're putting odds[?]. And you're just saying look, I'm going to pressure if the board wants to do what's right and return capital to shareholders, great, I don't have to do anything. If not, I'm prepared to go the next step is kind of where you're at, right? <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> That's totally right. I think that's a great way to put it. If the board is willing to play ball, we can have an amicable discussion. Of course, I welcome that first and foremost. But given some of the languages in their target statement, I think a prerequisite to that is going to be a change in managing director. <br><br>And so, maybe it's worth highlighting at least some of them. By the way, these are facts, these are not opinions. These are facts. But essentially, the managing director was appointed in 2011 in relation to FAR Energies merger with another small company called Flow Energy. Miss Norman was previously the managing director of that company. Since that time, she's been paying being paid gross compensation of 7.5 million Australian dollars. And delivered a negative 65% total shareholder return.<br><br>And today, she owns a couple of hundred thousand shares. And by the way, she did acquire a number of those shares in the open market, so it wasn't entirely all through grants and what have you[?]? But essentially my own holding at 1.5% is basically five times the entire boards holding today. So there's this basically, zero alignment between the board, the Legacy managing director and shareholders. And that's been the case for a very long time. <br><br>And as I said, 7.5 million gross compensation. I mean, to kind of put that in context, Miss Norman was getting paid regularly close to a million dollars a year. If you know, 78,900 churn[?] dollars a year. When the CEO of Woodside Australia is basically, were at the time was 25% of the CEO of Woodside's salary when the market Capex, one-one, ten thousandth or whatever it is. Right? <br><br>And so, there are a few other anecdotes that I'm you've all heard it before, but it only speaks to make the point. This company spends 500,000 dollars a year on office rents in Collins Street. Collins Street, Melbourne, by the way, I'm from Sydney. So I'm not taking a shot at Melbourne. Collins Street, Melbourne is kind of like Midtown Manhattan of Melbourne, white-collar bankers, lawyers territory.<br><br>I mean, this company has 85, 90 employees. It has no operating business. I mean, it's as a few, it has some businesses in West Africa where they're drilling for oil, but essentially has no operational revenue. No operating assets beyond a couple of drilling rigs which by the way, they don't own, they lease in, right? So for them to spend 500,000 dollars on and off head office rent for a company this size, is complete and utter, it's a joke frankly.<br><br>In 2020, the last disclosed year thus FAR, they spent a total of 2.7 million dollars on board compensation. Two point seven million dollars, again the board has shrunk since then. And again, those comments are to the previous board, not the current board, but the amount of corporate wastage and frittering of shareholders' assets when the board owns 0 shares have been frankly, objectionable. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Let me follow up on that, because, we can talk lots of risks and stuff. But this is a pretty simple story, right? This is an activist situation with hard assets, for the most part. You can quibble if the NPVs 10% or 9% or 11%, but accident situation at the hard assets here, I think the biggest risk is, I've looked at micro caps for a long time and there have been several times right by, this is a micro-cap trading below cash. Let's just like, get the CEO on the phone, tell him to return capital and it's never that simple. Right?<br><br>And you've seen, I've seen micro caps literally burn the bridges like just light the entire company on fire trying to hold on to their jobs. Trying to keep the activist. And sometimes, it's like one of those pyrrhic victories where the activist come in and win, but they come in and win and the insiders have spent 50 million dollars on activist defense. And there's just kind of nothing left at the company anymore. <br><br>So I guess the easiest pushback or the biggest risk here is, obviously, we can talk Hunter Douglas and you had great success there. The shareholder base here is turned over a lot. So you would think shareholders are probably supportive of getting more money over less, right? But what happens if managers says, "Hey, we're making a lot of money. We're in control of the company. We're going to burn all this money on fire, trying to fight the activists off and keep the gravy train coming as long as we can."<br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> All right, so I guess that's it. That's a very valid concern. Let me try and defang it as best I can. Firstly, as I mentioned, board renewal, this is not the board from elder, from the Legacy company. The two new board members essentially have no stake in maintaining the status quo, right? They've inherited a bad situation, sure. There are fees to be had, but if you look at the backgrounds of at least one if not both of those gentlemen, let's put it this way. <br><br>I believe they would be much more sympathetic to the argument I'm making to the Legacy board. So there's been some board renewal already. There are only three directors with two new and have been there for seven, eight months. And as you can imagine, you need a majority of the board to make it change at the MD position. So you can imagine how minimal board change is from here going forward could have a huge impact on the direction of the company. That's point one.<br><br>Point two, if actually read the target statement, they didn't come out right and say they agree with my agenda, of course, and there may be some elements within the board who want to maintain the gravy train. But if you look at what they've said about spending, they are doing a lot to kind of cut costs and wind down without saying it. So if you look at the two main exploration areas left Guinea-Bissau and The Gambia. Guinea-Bissau, they said, look, we're trying to farm down our interests along with the operator, so that we don't have to bear the costs of drilling a well. Okay, that's point one.<br><br>And then the Gambia, they said, yeah, there's still a lot of oil, we're encouraged about the future prospects. Nevertheless, we are trying to farm down our interests, such that we get a free carry-on a well to be drilled in late 2023. And some cash component[?] back for costs that have already been budgeted for 2022.<br><br>Not bad. And then, point three, they said we're continuing to try and cut head office costs including moving to a new head office premises in the near term. In other words, they're getting out of that Collins Street Building, finally. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yep.<br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> So you have three different items they're rapidly trying to cut costs. So, if your thesis was correct and these guys intend to pull up the moat and just fight to the death to get there, five, six hundred grand a year for the next 3-4 years, surely they'd be going the other way and say no, we're going to invest another 10 million drillings this well or that well. So it seems like they're maintaining some kind of posture. But at the same time, they're retreating somewhat from aggressive spinning.<br><br>So to your point, I think the situation is risky in the sense that it's a micro-cap, but I don't think it's all that risky. If they only commit to spending the six million dollars in 2022, which by the way, I think that number comes down further. Because as I said, cash on the balance sheet, 45 to 50 cents a share, plus the Woodside earn-out is, even at 50 cents on the dollar you're more than covered. <br><br>So this is still Raper Capital Special. It's like look after the downside, the upside will take care of itself. Yeah, I'm obviously trying to crystallize and catalyze that value return and get a huge excess return here. But you know, worst-case scenario, could I live with kind of a 75, 80 cents total return in six, nine months? Sure, I mean, that wouldn't be a great. I wouldn't put that up as a win, but it's not going to keep me in diamonds and furs, but I wouldn't be out on the street dancing for nickels.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> I would disagree with part of your thing, I think you could afford plenty of diamond and furs with that type of gross return. Let me tell one thing. I don't think this is essential to the thesis, but I do think it's worth discussion, and I think it's where a lot of people's first thoughts are. The reason I don't think it's to essential anymore, is I think this company is in play, right?<br><br>As you said, about a third of the companies turned over the stocks at 66, not 45 right now. But I'll go there anyway, STAM lobbed in their first bid at 45, right? <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Yep.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> And right now, there's one bidder. The one bidder is STAM at 45. So I don't think they're going up to 60, 65 or something. I don't know what they're doing. So just can you talk to me for a second? You're not a group. I don't know if you talk to them or not, but I know you're not a group with STAM. But can you just talk to me for a second about what you think STAM's going to do or thinking here?<br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Sure. So, as I said, STAM is a long-short value-oriented investment fund in Sydney. As you said, 45 cent bid, it's almost impossible not to make a great return right? There are no doubt very happy to take the whole thing down or just control of the company at that level. They see what I see it. It's simple. <br><br>Having said all that, I think they must have been realistic and thought, well, we may not get control. We may not be able to get the whole thing. But at least we're going to highlight the value and encourage other like-minded investors to look at this thing, which is essentially what happened. <br><br>And this is essentially what they did in their last activist case. So I mean, you can look at this is all public information in Australia. They have a history of going around and bidding sometimes for control of deeply discounted securities. And they're not ending up getting control, but nevertheless either getting a few percent or getting the board to play balls essentially. <br><br>So there was a company called Kangaroo Island Timber that is now Kiland (KIL) on the Australian stock exchange. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yep.<br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> That was one of the last one STAM did. You can look it up. They bid a dollar. I'm going from memory. So I don't know the exact numbers, but they bid at a somewhat of a premium to the extant stock price, I think it was a dollar-dollar five or something. They already own 20%, so they had a much larger shareholding and the 20-25 percent. They bid at a dollar-dollar five, which is still a huge discount to the asset. <br><br>But again a similar situation mismanaged entity, huge hard asset value, etc. They bid a dollar-dollar five. They didn't get many acceptances, maybe a couple of percent. They got up to 27, 28%. I'm not sure where. But thereafter, the board made their defense in a target statement. Say it rejected, said, we're worth $2 a share or whatever. And then, the next thing that the board did is they bought the quarter of the company in dollar 35. The stock today is like a dollar 40. <br><br>So sure, they didn't get their playbook across, in the sense they didn't get to buy the whole thing at a deep discount, but they nevertheless extracted a huge amount of value. Now, I don't know their current [unintelligible]... and has a stock come off since then. I was looking at it like a couple of weeks ago. So maybe it's lower, the market obviously been crushed. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> But no, I was just saying, that's beautiful stuff. It's wonderful to... <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Yeah, I mean, so they want to motivate and encourage through a visible campaign. I'm sorry, they want to. I'm speculating what they want. I have no idea what they want. But it makes sense to open the tent to broaden the investment tent for those who see the value. Because ultimately, it's a voting game, right? <br><br>And so they have 5%. But if another 15, 20% join, then all of a sudden you're guaranteed to get at least one board seat by force or by voluntary measures. And at that point, at the very least, we can return a huge amount of that excess cash.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> So the company just published their response to the bid yesterday, two days ago, something like that. Where do we go from here?<br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Sure. This is a slightly more speculative, basically the bid. Okay. So I'll just give you the timeline. So STAM's bid will expire on March 14th. I assume it will be largely rejected given the stock price where it is. So thereafter, those shareholders who have an interest in this will have to make a decision. Do you form a group? Do not form a group? Do you get your boards slate together? What do you do, call an EGM? Or do you wait for the AGM? <br><br>So, the Annual General Meeting (AGM) last year was in June. I assumed it would be it's similar timing today. There is one important detail I forgot to mention during the lead-up, which is very important in particular to this case. In Australia, there's a rule called the two-strike rule, which is a very interesting rule. If the remuneration policy gets at least 25% votes against...<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Just for our domestic listeners, remuneration, that's a big word. <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Compensation.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> That's the Say-on-Pay Votes in Australia.<br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> The Say-on-Pay Votes. If you get at least 25% against, it's deemed a strike. So, for example, you have the Say-on-Pay Vote, once a year at the AGM. If you get 25% against one year, that's strike one. Then, the next one rolls around. If you get another 25% against, that's strike two. That automatically forces what's called a spill vote? Where every director, not the MD but every director is automatically put up for re-election at a new vote. <br><br>So because FAR Management has been so historically bad, they did get that first strike last year. Meaning at the AGM this year, it's almost guaranteed. They will get a similar strike, meaning, if we go to the AGM, there will most likely be a spilt vote. Now, that means they'll be another vote sometime later, I think it's 60 or 90 days later, where all the directors have to be put up for re-election again. <br><br>And to be honest, you need 50%, right? So they may get the 50%. But it's my view that once there is a spill vote, once that remuneration policy gets that second strike, that in itself is a huge catalyst for board renewal. And obviously, the new members on the board, even though we were elected last year, they're not up for renewal but in a spill that they would be put up for renewal. So the managing director would not be at risk. I mistakenly thought the managing director would be up for a new role as well. It's not just the director but the two new directors would. <br><br>And so if they don't get the necessary votes, then of course, at that time, someone like me would likely proposed a new slate and those directors would obviously do what I suggested in my platform. And so, now that's a bit more of an extended process I think than an EGM. And any shareholder who owns 5% or group can call an EGM at which they can propose these resolutions to similar effect. <br><br>Now, you have to give 21 days notice. And then, directors have I believe it's 90 days to call an EGM. So, if you think about the timeline STAM bid's expires on March 14th. Thereafter, I imagine I will have conversations with a wide variety of shareholders and the company. Thereafter, you may or may not see an EGM resolution or we may wait till June go to the AGM. <br><br>But basically, within six months, I imagine this will be resolved one way or another. It's how I would put it. This isn't a 2 or 3 year trait. Within six months, one way or another, we will either have the board we have or a new board and a new MD or we won't. And we will know what's going to happen. <br><br>So in terms of cash burn at the company short 2022, you're going to continue to burn somewhere between, they said, six plus million dollars of cash out this year. I think it'll be lower than that. But yeah, you might have multi-million dollar cash out this year, but 2023 sure, the only other real liabilities on the balance sheet at least liabilities related to the office exit, which I believe were included largely in the 6 million. <br><br>And then drilling licenses and requirements which were running at a million a quarter. <br>But essentially, the thing about drilling license is if you are willing to bite the bullet and say we won't get anything back and just give up your rights to drill, you can walk away free and clear. <br><br>Maybe you have to pay some of the contractors a bit. But if you give up your rights, you don't have to put any more money in. My point is we do much better off getting a guaranteed dollar 25, dollar 30 back through a creative capital usage, then trying to drill for something that may or may not be there and we don't have the resources for. <br><br>So my kind of base or upside case scenario, I think the based case scenario is we're sitting here 12 months from today with a dollar 30 of value in our pockets, largely derived from a huge tender at a creative level. And Woodside cutting us to check early, which is in their best interest as well. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Okay, I think we've covered a lot here. It's late, my time. I'm going to get ready to go to bed in a second. But I want to ask two questions. First, FAR, I think we pretty much-covered everything. But is there any point you wish we could hit or anything we should have a little harder?<br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> I think that's basically it. I mean, I would only highlight, it is a small-cap company and not the most. I mean, it's liquid now, but it's often not the most liquid security. But in terms of actual...<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> But it is at the most, like with as someone who tried to buy a couple of shares the other day, it took some work and I'd have this overnights and Australian [unintelligible] something. It's not easy. <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Well, the thing is it was trading very aggressively in 50, 60 cents of range. It was trading a few million dollars a day, but it's kind of dried up around 65 cents, which makes sense. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Well the 50, 60 cents ranges, the range I wanted to pay Jeremy.<br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> You snooze, you lose mate. Got to wake up and trade local time. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> I know. <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> But look, who knows you might get another chance. I think we covered everything. I think we should probably do an update at some point in the next. I don't know, three months, four months from today. We should have a good idea of where we stand. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Well, my second question was I think every time I have you on, we say we're going to do just a run down and just talk lots of events stocks and stuff. But again, it's running late. So I don't know if we're going to do that, but maybe we'll do the three-month update and do that. But anything else on your radar you want to chat about in terms of event land[?]?<br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Dude, I mean, I've got another 10 minutes if you do. But if you want to, it's getting late, right? So you want to call it a day.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> We will try for 10 minutes. I'll try to eyes open for 10 more minutes. <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> All right. Well, I think there are a few questions on Twitter about Last minute, European Travel Stock. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Oh, I know. Well, yep. I know well because you're the one who told me to do it. Yes, I've told you. Go ahead. <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Yeah. As you can say, this is interesting. I mean, look, you have people fighting over themselves to pay mid-teens[?] and multiple of US OTAs. Wherever booking at Expedia trade and like in the last 12 months, we've seen a pretty aggressive local recovery in the US and everyone's buildup on the leisure travel return trade post-Covid. <br><br>But you know, Europe is essentially 12 months, 15 months, maybe more, but maybe not that. Twelve months behind where the US was just given the slower vaccine roll out in the more fragmentation of the market and you have looked lastminute.com is a Swiss listed smallishcat security, it's about a 500 million market cap.<br><br>In trading and I think four and a half times even EBITDA, post covid EBITDA. And they literally just came out in therefore, Q[?] report and said, it's okay. So, it's just to give a few elements of context. I don't have time to go into all of them. But essentially, they focus on packages. So not pure of Vanilla flights but packages, so flight plus Hotel bundled together. That's the core of their offering. <br><br>So they're much more akin to some business like Thomas Cook that went defunct or TUI, a big German listed operator, or even something like On the Beach, which is a UK Focus travel provider. Then they are to a pure OTA with has a much higher flight exposure like booking. <br><br>Anyway, they came out and said, we're seeing massive demand in February. Essentially, despite Omicron January was a very good month, February, a huge demand running 20% above pre-Covid level... <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> So Jeremy, "they" is last minute or "they" is booking?<br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> "They" is last minute. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> When they say that, I didn't see them say that[?]. <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Yeah, it was 19% above run rate. To be clear, in February. So not in the reported numbers before Q[?], but in recent weeks we're seeing 19% above run rate. Pre-covid, February, whatever it was the demand for packages. <br><br>And so, I mean, there are a few threads to pull out here. I guess those threads I like to pull out into the easiest to quantify and that is the cost-out opportunity. Right? So basically during covid, a lot of businesses did this. They went through and deracinated the cost structure of their business. <br><br>So, if booking levels GTV, so Gross Travel Value, basically, bookings get back to 2019 levels. I think instead of making 50, 60 million of EBITDA, I think they'd be making 80 and 90 million of EBITDA, right just there. <br><br>Then you have this structural move away from single flight bookings to more curated travel, right? So there's a structural move towards packages. People want to get everything buttoned up before they travel now. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Is there a share[?] that move to that? <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> They've been telling about it. The numbers seem to see, its very early in Europe, but a lot of providers have been talking about. TUI mentioned that aggressively. Last minute mentioned it a lot. It seems like there's a bit more interest towards it. <br><br>And in the third angle is strategic interest. This is obviously, special situations guy like me. This is where I really get out of bed excited. Is booking.com bought another European travel player Etraveli for a huge multiple of what turned out to be a loss-making business. I thought it was a profitable business, but they paid it a billion-plus for a business. <br><br>It's in a vertical essentially meta and flight oriented, but they wanted to integrate their offerings in Europe and then booking on their recent calls, said look, we could have competed and built the technology ourselves. But in Europe, it's quite complex given all the different markets.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> And that's important because, correct me if I'm wrong. But last minute does bookings. If you're on the booking website and you look for a package in Europe, last minute is the technology behind that. <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> That's right.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> The same rationale would play out. <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Yes. That's true. Slightly more nuanced in the booking does white label lastminute.com dynamic package offering, meaning a package of this not like seven days from Sunday to Sunday, but customized by the user. So, okay, I want to leave on a Wednesday, come back on a Tuesday. <br><br>And I want to fly Ryanair. So a customizable package called a dynamic package. That technology was developed and licensed by a last minute, not just to booking but to a number of other Hotel operators and sites in Europe as well. <br><br>But yes, that's a good strong validation for the technology. And it's essentially what booking was doing with Etraveli. They were a supplier to booking as well, and then they got rolled up for the synergies. <br><br>And so, I think there are just multiple ways to win either Europe reopens, it's 100% Leisure Travel. Leisure travel comes back, roaring. Everyone's talking about this thing trades on a very low multiple. <br><br>Two, booking tries to roll it up because they need the technology. They don't want to build it themselves. The market access 13 different markets that that last-minute is licensed in. All the local language support the last minute spent many years developing.<br><br>And three, the ownership structure of the business would encourage a sale because one of the founders recently sold down to essentially, a Private Equity buyer. Private Equity is increasingly dominating the float. I think they own about 30, maybe even 40% of the look-through and [unintelligible].<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> They were trying to sell before covid. If I remember correctly, weren't they? <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> They almost sold the business pre-covid at a level "much higher than the extant stock price". And the stock of that time was in the mid 40s. Yeah, I mean, I can't see how this trades it four or 41/2 of EBITDA even if it doesn't get taken out in 2022. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> The other thing that's interesting, I'm not involved here currently, but I did a decent bit of work on it when you first mentioned it to me. If you go through, I don't think they published the 2021 financials, either 2020 financials or the 2021 semi-annual financials, I can't remember. <br><br>If you look in the footnotes, they give you their goodwill and how they model and they give you the DCF or how they get their goodwill, which is them giving you their internal projections for what the business is going to do. <br><br>And it's a lot harder than what the current stock price has implied which internal projections, whatever. But I hadn't seen anyone, talk about them and my history has been when a company puts into a financial filing future projections that have been run by auditors. Because again that's in the footnotes to the auditors that to bless that, it tends to be pretty interesting if it's hugely diversion from what the stock market has. <br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Totally. That was a great catch. I should have mentioned that. And then, the other thing that's more obvious, unless observant person like myself, is that the executive comp package is two-thirds of it is struck at 60 francs a share of stocks at 40. <br><br>Now that these guys are getting paid unless the stock gets opportunity above 60 Euros, that's 50% upside right there. I mean, I kind of targeted some lower multiple, nevertheless, I think achievable multiple for a potential transaction with booking like a high single-digit multiple of neuron right earnings that get you a mid-70s stock price, 80 francs in stock price.<br><br>So it's pretty juicy, I think. Anyway, it's late. So I want to let you get to bed, but that's that's the one that's really on my radar. That's one of my bigger positions at the moment[?]. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Perfect, pretty well. Hey, Jeremy, in a couple of months we'll have to do is catch up on farm. We're going to have to do the long awaited, you and I just go through 10 different event names. And I think it's a really interesting time for events right now. <br><br>I posted something the other day just like, not that I've never, but, interestingly, you and I talked MoneyGram offline before but I just use the MoneyGram, for example because...<br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Yeah, pretty cool.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Thank you. I wish I had been a lot bigger but I just use the example. Like Reuters reports bid at 10-50 or whatever. Three bidders come in bids at 10[?] and the stock was at nine dollars for three weeks. And I just kept looking at me like what's going on and then a deal came. But we've seen several those Tegna the other day, there was one bid of 23. There is one bid at 24. <br><br>Stock closes last week at 20-50. And they announced a deal this week at 24. And I know these aren't like screaming grand slams, Jeremy Raper buy something for 40 cents and liquidates it for a dollar 20. But like there's interesting and I'm seeing a lot of those and I know some of those fit into your wheelhouse. So we're going to have to do that. <br><br>Jeremy Raper, I'm going to include a link to his Twitter. So look, if you're an Australian shareholder of FAR and you're just looking to swap notes, looking stock, clicking to its smarter[?]. Please reach out to Jeremy. <br><br>I do not empty this board if they try to stop you from doing what's rational here because we saw at Hunter Douglas, you'll probably get what you want. But thanks for coming over Jeremy. We'll chat soon.<br><br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Thanks, man. Thanks for having me. I appreciate it. Speak soon.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Bye, buddy.<br><br>[END]</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Premium: Gambling on a special situation]]></title><description><![CDATA[I mentioned last week that I thought there was an incredible opportunity set in rumored deals.

Why?</p><p>Well,<a href="https://yetanothervalueblog.substack.com/p/tegus-sponsored-deep-dive-1-cable-b64?r=a7n3"> part 2 detailed lots of stuff on fixed wireless</a>, but the basic thing I kept coming back to is that fixed wireless&#8217;s limitations meant it could really only compete with broadband in places where carriers had lots of extra spectrum, which tend to be very rural areas&#8230; and even there, fixed wireless probably would only make sense for people who didn&#8217;t have access to good &#8220;normal&#8221; broadband. You can see that in how mobile players are deploying: TMUS is rapidly expanding their fixed wireless offerings (<a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/5g/t-mobile-expands-5g-fixed-wireless-across-three-more-states?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=FT-NL-FierceWireless&amp;oly_enc_id=5123F8662390H8Z">they rolled out three new states last week!</a>), but they know that <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/operators/t-mobile-sees-2-categories-fixed-wireless-opportunity">their fixed wireless option is best for underserved communities that don&#8217;t have great broadband currently</a> (perhaps <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/fixed-wireless-service-quality-lags-wired-broadband-says-evercore">because their product is generally inferior to cable / fiber broadband</a>!).</p><p>Starry is a completely different. Their network is designed for urban spaces. Basically, they use high frequency / millimeter wave spectrum (which can carry lots of data but doesn&#8217;t travel a long distance / degrades rapidly if it passes through something like a wall). I&#8217;ll let the company explain it a little bit <a href="https://www.bamsec.com/filing/119312522030843?cik=1822219">(from this interview</a>):</p><blockquote><p>Starry pioneered the use of very high-capacity spectrum in the millimeter wave frequencies. Typically, when you&#8217;re building a network using fiber or things like that, you&#8217;re digging up streets, trenching thin wires and poles and that&#8217;s all very expensive and time consuming. What Starry does is get that last-mile physical infrastructure and just does it wirelessly. And, the reason we are able to do that is we pretty much created a category of using millimeter wave spectrum or high-capacity. Historically, that spectrum was considered difficult to use, fragile junk. Starry pioneered, about six years ago, how to develop and use that spectrum for high-capacity. And, that really allows us to cut our cost structure down dramatically which is a benefit that we just pass on to customers.</p></blockquote><p>So, basically, Starry got access to a bunch of really high frequency spectrum no one wanted. They take that spectrum and go out and put dishes on tall towers to send out their signal, and they put receivers on the tops of buildings. That&#8217;s an important combo; again, millimeter wave degrades quickly if there&#8217;s any interference (i.e. if there&#8217;s a wall or building between your tower and the receiver), so a tall tower + receiver on the roof let&#8217;s them dodge interference.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb8900bc-7243-48e5-a68a-857ef3cda42e_934x499.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb8900bc-7243-48e5-a68a-857ef3cda42e_934x499.png" width="934" height="499" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bb8900bc-7243-48e5-a68a-857ef3cda42e_934x499.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:499,&quot;width&quot;:934,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:464024,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb8900bc-7243-48e5-a68a-857ef3cda42e_934x499.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb8900bc-7243-48e5-a68a-857ef3cda42e_934x499.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb8900bc-7243-48e5-a68a-857ef3cda42e_934x499.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb8900bc-7243-48e5-a68a-857ef3cda42e_934x499.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Starry&#8217;s initial target market was large apartment buildings (Multiple dwelling units, or MDUs).

(obviously there are lots of other factors). Starry is saying they can build networks at 1% the cost of fiber and break-even at 4% penetration, so their low cost means they can attack traditional broadband in very different ways and still make money. Here&#8217;s how the company<a href="https://www.bamsec.com/filing/119312521351785?cik=1822219"> put it at an analyst interview in December</a>:</p><blockquote><p>There&#8217;s a lot of talk for fiber today, obviously and let&#8217;s divide that into two categories. Number one, what I will say LECs that are going to invest in fiber, whether it&#8217;s companies that have been restructured or whether it&#8217;s folks at AT&amp;T or whatever, and our view is that&#8217;s going to be, going into solidify their position. I mean, these people already have broadband customers, so really the first foray of that fiber is going to be making sure those customers are shored up. So we don&#8217;t necessarily expect a wholesale new set of passings being built out over the next three to five years, at least over the next three anyways. And then you have a lot of private equity type of money coming into the market, given the cheap money conditions. But ultimately as you compare fiber to Starry from a build perspective, we break even at 45&nbsp;percent from a take-rate perspective. Whereas you can bend it, fudge it, but the reality is you need 40 plus percent take rate in new fiber build to be able to justify it and with a very long payback window, whereas we hit these numbers in about 18 months or so. So we think we&#8217;re competitively very well positioned against, what I will call, a slow-moving progression. And frankly, if you&#8217;re coming in as a third party into the mix, Starry plus coax plus maybe a new slow roll of fiber, your take rates by default go down and then that creates additional pressure. So we feel really good because, not only can we pass at a very low cost, we can build a network at an incredibly high speed.</p></blockquote><p>And not only is it low cost, but it&#8217;s a service that actually seems competitive with cable / fiber. I talked in both the<a href="https://yetanothervalueblog.substack.com/p/tegus-sponsored-deep-dive-1-cable-d8f?r=a7n3"> Starlink section</a> and <a href="https://yetanothervalueblog.substack.com/p/tegus-sponsored-deep-dive-1-cable-b64?r=a7n3">the fixed wireless</a> section about how I thought the services would struggle to keep up with continued growth in data consumption. Starry is aware of that issue and seems to have a solution that can <a href="https://www.bamsec.com/filing/119312521351785?cik=1822219">keep up with that demand</a>:</p><blockquote><p>But today for example, in the fixed line broadband we&#8217;re seeing 30&nbsp;percent growth on data patterns, on data consumption, on an annualized basis and that&#8217;s compounding. So as you think from a competition and mode perspective, we think of obviously, wireline customer technologies, let&#8217;s just call it fiber, has a huge advantage over anybody else in terms of the capacity that they can ultimately be offering and also the speeds. And so you compare that to say, what does Starry have. Is that good enough for the next five, seven, ten, fifteen, whatever, the time horizon that you have. And as we look at, even the technology generation that we&#8217;re deploying today at a 30&nbsp;percent compounded growth on data consumption we&#8217;re not going to come close to sniffing the headroom of what we are already deploying today, right? As you think about on a per site basis, 35 to 40 gigabits a second of speed that we&#8217;re capable of delivering. And you&#8217;ve got spectral efficiency now driving effectively two to three gigahertz for the spectrum utilization off of a single one of those sites, which whose radiation pattern is limited to let&#8217;s call it a mild and extreme case between 1.2 and 1.6 kilometers. So there isn&#8217;t a whole lot that is on the horizon that as you think about it, that says I will have sufficient speed and capacity. And that&#8217;s a really important point for, I think investors. Ultimately what means success for a consumer is not necessarily just the speed you can deliver, but how much capacity you have, meaning how many customers at the same time can consume that much speed. So mobility or mobile-based networks fall short on that because their capacity is limited, number one. Number two, a fixed customer is consuming 50 times more data than a mobile customer. So by default, your revenue per bit falls 1/50. So that&#8217;s not a good, smart trade off when you&#8217;ve just spent 50 plus billion dollars or whatever it is in acquiring mobile spectrum. And then it&#8217;s the same challenge with the LEOs&#8212;effectively they&#8217;re not as capacity constrained as the geostationary guys are, but ultimately if you just take a step back the United States represents, give or take seven percent of the land mass, alright, of the world and 70&nbsp;percent of the world is water. So effectively your entire constellation is spending an incredible amount of time over what I will call non-population centers, right, and really what that capacity is appropriate for and intended for. So they&#8217;ll have great applications in those, but high-density broadband is not one of them in cities and suburbs.</p></blockquote><p>So I think the Starry threat is very real and, on the whole, the scariest of the threats I&#8217;ve talked about in this series. Why is Starry scarier to me than the other threats? As discussed above, the cost and that the current product seems to offer speeds and capacity similar to cable is a big piece of it. </p><p>But what really worries me about Starry is not Starry specifically. It&#8217;s that, if this model works, I see no reason why every wireless player couldn&#8217;t copy it eventually. Starry<a href="https://www.bamsec.com/filing/121390021051724/10?cik=1822219"> invested ~$200m in R&amp;D to develop a system</a> that let&#8217;s them roll out fixed wireless that can compete with broadband in urban areas.</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;To dive a little bit deeper into the intellectual property stack that we have developed and are rapidly deploying, when we started, this technology didn&#8217;t exist and outside of the stack we have built, we don&#8217;t believe there is any other technology that is available in the market today with the same capability at the same cost structur<strong>e. We&#8217;ve invested nearly $200 million to develop and commercialize our technology with an incredibly talented team</strong>. Starry&#8217;s expertise spans RF engineering, smart antenna systems, high frequency integrated circuit design, software that runs close to the metal, and network engineering, and software in cloud. We iterate and integrate all of these disciplines to build our technology stack to achieve very attractive unit economics. We also have a dedicated team of care professionals that are quick and responsive and effective sales and marketing engine and a skilled field team that is in the frontlines deploying our network and service our customers. This is the result of our hard work and innovation.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Verizon doesn&#8217;t disclose their R&amp;D number, but in 2021 they spent $29B in SG&amp;A (which should include R&amp;D) and another ~$20B in capex (plus $48B in wireless spectrum spend and another $4B for an acquisition). If the Starry model works, I see no way that Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile don&#8217;t end up copying / stealing all their tech and their model. If those three are successful, suddenly they could use the Starry model to roll out a fixed wireless product in every major city in America, and we&#8217;d see massive broadband competition in the largest cities in America, which would destroy the cable franchises. Again, Starry is saying they can deliver gig speeds at $10-15/HP, and they need just 4-5% penetration to break even on their model. The big 3 wireless players would look at that spend as a drop in the bucket compared to their existing capex plans, and they&#8217;d almost certainly get to that penetration just by marketing to their wireless customers <a href="https://www.bamsec.com/filing/121390021051724/10?cik=1822219">(quote below from Starry&#8217;s announce call</a>).</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Second, we were vertically integrated as a company with design and built our own technology at low cost and assembled much of here in the United States. As a result, we are able to build a gigabit speed last mile coverage layer at $10 to $15 per home pass. The coverage CAPEX is nominal, and the majority of the CAPEX is variable, and success based, meaning only when the customer orders the service. This is the inverse of a traditional fixed line broadband network where most of the CAPEX is spent up front before a single customer is attached to the network. This allows us to get to even, break even at just four to five percent of homes under coverage.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>This is a point several of the experts I talked to emphasized; the threat from Starry isn&#8217;t Starry. It&#8217;s that the big wireless companies will eventually copy Starry&#8217;s model; in fact, the fate of a Starry investor could come down to how big wireless players view Starry through a buy/build framework (i.e. is it cheaper to recreate Starry&#8217;s tech and try to poach their customers, or just pay up for Starry and buy all their tech and customers in one swoop).</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55029eff-59a9-4067-ac8e-ef46ede7d38f_738x429.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55029eff-59a9-4067-ac8e-ef46ede7d38f_738x429.png" width="738" height="429" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/55029eff-59a9-4067-ac8e-ef46ede7d38f_738x429.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:429,&quot;width&quot;:738,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:234727,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55029eff-59a9-4067-ac8e-ef46ede7d38f_738x429.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55029eff-59a9-4067-ac8e-ef46ede7d38f_738x429.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55029eff-59a9-4067-ac8e-ef46ede7d38f_738x429.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55029eff-59a9-4067-ac8e-ef46ede7d38f_738x429.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>So, as a cable investor, my worry is not on Starry in particular, but on what happens to cable companies if the Starry model is proved out and all the wireless companies copy it.</p><p>It&#8217;s a big concern, but ultimately I think it&#8217;s one that cable can overcome. Why?</p><p>Well, first I&#8217;d note that this is a concern that only applies to <strong>very </strong>dense urban areas with big MDUs. Obviously that&#8217;s millions and millions of households, but that leaves a lot of cable&#8217;s franchise protected from the Starry risk. </p><p>Second, I&#8217;d note that Starry remains alone in pursuing this model despite the apparent success of their initial roll out. The cable and wireless companies aren&#8217;t dumb (with one or two exceptions). They&#8217;ve seen the model Starry is pursuing for years; I find it curious that none of them have chosen to aggressively copy the Starry model. Perhaps the wireless companies aren&#8217;t copying the Starry model because they can&#8217;t figure the tech out, but (again) Starry spent a fraction of a fraction of what the major companies spend in R&amp;D and capex every year. I struggle to believe they couldn&#8217;t recreate the Starry model if they wanted to. More likely, I think the wireless companies believe there is some risk to the Starry model longer term that suggests investing R&amp;D to copy the model would not be a good spend.</p><p>What could that risk be?</p><p>I think there are two related risks. The first is that the Starry model looks great when you&#8217;re adding your first set of customers to the network, but performance and reliability quickly trails off as the network fills up. This <a href="https://yetanothervalueblog.substack.com/p/tegus-sponsored-deep-dive-1-cable-d8f?utm_source=url">issue is very similar to the one that came up time and again when discussing Starlink</a>; the network works great for the first set of customer, but when you put the second set on the performance of the whole network degrades. Sure enough, it was one of the first risks / reasons for suspicion experts identified when talking Starry.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e42f6de-96b2-4721-a13b-d22b7e286834_765x491.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e42f6de-96b2-4721-a13b-d22b7e286834_765x491.png" width="765" height="491" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2e42f6de-96b2-4721-a13b-d22b7e286834_765x491.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:491,&quot;width&quot;:765,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:327590,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e42f6de-96b2-4721-a13b-d22b7e286834_765x491.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e42f6de-96b2-4721-a13b-d22b7e286834_765x491.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e42f6de-96b2-4721-a13b-d22b7e286834_765x491.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e42f6de-96b2-4721-a13b-d22b7e286834_765x491.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>If I had to guess, this risk is the reason wireless companies aren&#8217;t aggressively following the Starry model. They&#8217;ve run tests in their labs, and the results suggest that the network will degrade quickly as additional customers come online, and they&#8217;ll never be able to recoup their investment into the product. And, if the current wireless companies can&#8217;t justify the investment with their huge fixed cost base, spectrum resources, etc&#8230;.. it suggests Starry&#8217;s going to have trouble in the long term. Heck, <a href="https://yetanothervalueblog.substack.com/p/tegus-sponsored-deep-dive-1-cable-b64?utm_source=url">as noted in part 3</a>, even T-Mobile (the fixed wireless champion) is <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/t-mobile-launches-home-fiber-service-in-manhattan-yes-its-real">renting fiber to attack the Manhattan market</a>. I suspect they would have loved to go with the Starry model if they thought it was feasible as they took share and ramped.</p><p>The second risk to the Starry model is pretty simple. For a long time, cable has argued that a competitor coming in with a fixed wireless build out is very similar to an overbuilder. Remember that broadband consumes much more data than a typical wireless user, and in order to handle that much data fixed wireless needs to go over much higher frequencies. Higher frequencies degrade faster, so running a fixed wireless network generally means you need to build small cells much, much closer to where people live than you would with a cellular tower. Basically, a fixed wireless network eventually starts looking very similar to a cable network, except at the very end of the network there&#8217;s a small cell running very high frequencies instead of coax fiber running into your home.</p><p>So I think the second risk to Starry is that they found a novel way to cheaply create a cable overbuilder&#8230;. but Starry really only owns their technology and customer relationships. They don&#8217;t actually own the network or any of the physical infrastructure. That&#8217;s fine now&#8230;. but there&#8217;s a limited amount of fiber and backhaul capacity in any town. If the Starry model is really successful, on the backend I suspect they are going to run into some real issues with the people who actually own the infrastructure they&#8217;re leasing (the towers, the fiber connecting to the providers, etc.). Remember that selling data is very high gross margin but requires a huge fixed investment; in the long run, I suspect all of that gross margin goes to the person who made the fixed investment, not the person who is good at customer service or who has developed a really unique last mile solution (that I suspect can be copied).</p><p>(PS- another interesting risk: if the Starry model really works, the success of it will have come in large part from how undervalued the super high frequency spectrum they run their network on was. Going forward, similar spectrum will get bid up like crazy, which will drive up the cost of similar models / expansion).</p><p>I&#8217;m not a network engineer, so I feel like I&#8217;m having trouble explaining that thought. Maybe that suggests I haven&#8217;t fully internalized or thought about it properly yet, so let me try a different way. Years ago, there were tons of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_virtual_network_operator">Mobile Virtual Network Operators (</a>MVNOs). These are companies like Cricket wireless that don&#8217;t own their wireless networks, but are simply brands that acquire customers while leasing one of the big mobile networks like Verizon or AT&amp;T. Over time, all of those mobile players went went bankrupt or were acquired for a song because the people who actually own the networks ultimately had all of the leverage in their relationships.</p><p>I suspect Starry is going to run into a similar problem. In the long run, the towers and fiber they are leasing can say &#8220;Hey, nice business you&#8217;ve got there. We own own one of the only two small cells on this block, and all of your infrastructure is on our tower. We&#8217;re raising your prices by 50x and taking away all of your excess profits; you can take it or leave it, but if you leave it you don&#8217;t have a business.&#8221;</p><p>Maybe that&#8217;s a little on the extreme side. Again, I&#8217;m not a network engineer, and I don&#8217;t have access to Starry&#8217;s data room and contracts and everything. But everything I&#8217;ve seen in telecom suggests that the economics ultimately flow to the party that owns the most irreplaceable part of the network; in Starry&#8217;s case, that&#8217;s the people who built and own the local fiber / towers that Starry&#8217;s network operates on, not Starry itself.</p><p>FWIW, the experts appeared to agree with my conclusions. While they generally were impressed by Starry&#8217;s execution to date and one suggested <a href="https://app.tegus.co/app/transcript/26122">Chet (their CEO) was a &#8220;great visionary&#8221;</a>, in general they thought Starry wasn&#8217;t a huge risk to cable in the long run (though they certainly noted competition would be ramping up for cable in the long run!).</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9eacbbd5-12ef-4aab-a5ac-a9d71f9f0b15_1044x228.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9eacbbd5-12ef-4aab-a5ac-a9d71f9f0b15_1044x228.png" width="1044" height="228" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9eacbbd5-12ef-4aab-a5ac-a9d71f9f0b15_1044x228.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:228,&quot;width&quot;:1044,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:65902,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9eacbbd5-12ef-4aab-a5ac-a9d71f9f0b15_1044x228.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9eacbbd5-12ef-4aab-a5ac-a9d71f9f0b15_1044x228.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9eacbbd5-12ef-4aab-a5ac-a9d71f9f0b15_1044x228.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9eacbbd5-12ef-4aab-a5ac-a9d71f9f0b15_1044x228.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>I&#8217;m going to wrap it up here; overall, I think Starry (and the model they&#8217;ve built) are the scariest when it comes to cable, but my &#8220;MVNO mental model&#8221; suggests that Starry is going to struggle in the long term from not owning their full stack, and the fact that seemingly no one else globally is rushing to copy the Starry model suggests to me that they are likely to struggle as the try to scale up.

Welcome to yet another Value Podcast. I am your host, Andrew Walker. And with me today, I am happy to have my friend, Bill Chen. Bill is a managing partner at an institutional real estate fund. Bill, how is it going? <br><br><strong>Bill Chen</strong>: Great. Thank you for having me on. I appreciate it. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Hey, thanks for coming on. Let me start this podcast the way I do every podcast. First, a disclaimer to remind everyone that nothing on this podcast is investing advice. Please consult your financial advisor, do your work, all that type of stuff. And then second, a pitch for you, my guest, the obvious pitch here would be to let listeners know that you are by far the best croquet player I know. I will take you over anyone on pinch with. Bill gave me quite the beatdown last fall. But look, I have known you for a couple of months. You're a great guy. You're a great investor in New York City real estate, in particular. Maybe that's because as you were telling me before, you've seen a hundred different ways to lose money in New York real estate. But I have seen yourself, I know you do great due diligence on the companies you invest in. And for that reason, I am excited to go to the company we are going to talk about today. So, that out the way, let us dive right into the company we are going to talk about. I know this is a high conviction idea for you. It is FRP Holdings. The ticker is FRPH. And all that out the way, I'll turn it over to you. What is so interesting about FRPH?<br><br><strong>Bill:</strong> I think what is interesting about FRPH is a good way to think about it is that there is a billionaire family and they own a collection of high-quality hard assets that work in an inflationary environment, that works in a deflationary environment that you could buy today, you pay $55 for it, it is probably worth $90. It is my personal opinion that it would be worth about $110, two years out. And again, it's got a good collection of trophy assets. You could buy it at roughly sixty cents on a dollar. It probably grows 10% at its fair market value. Actually, on a look-through basis, you are compounding at about 18% roughly, give or take. And then there is a huge gain that you could potentially get from that gap closing. But just the fact that you are buying at sixty cents on a dollar and the inner asset is growing at 10%. That gives you an 18% compounding. <br><br>And I think that's attractive. I am a brick-and-mortar guy, so I get into the assets and I think about the public market, the private market. What the private market will pay for this collection of assets versus what you could buy in a public market. And frankly, any big REIT would love to own this collection of assets. Any big family office that is managing more than $10 billion would love to own this collection of assets at the price today. And that assures this is one of the advantages of being a public investment is that you could own a collection of assets like this at a fraction of what it would cost in the private market while the billionaire family, you get to tag along while they are doing all the heavy lifting for you. So, that is what gets me excited about it. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yes, that was a great overview because everything that I've got on my question list and everything, you hinted out there. So we are just going to be diving into everything you just went through in the interview. Let's start with the controlling shareholder. I don't think FRP is a REIT yet, right? Right now they are just a normal public company. There has been talked of REIT conversion, but one of the things with big public companies with chunky real estate holdings like this is you have got to trust in the management team, right? <br><br>Because a big building, it's going to throw off lots of cash flows. They're going to have to reinvest it and it runs the gamut. We all know of public companies that have lots of real estate holdings and the money just goes into management's pocket one way or the other or there are real estate companies that compound value over time. Let's start with FRPH's management team. I know there is a really interesting history here of how they got to the current set of assets. Let us just go in the background there.<br><br><strong>Bill:</strong> Let us go into the background of all of this. the Baker family owns about 30% of shares outstanding, and who is the Baker family? Right before the financial crisis, and I think around 2006, Vulcan Materials approach a company called Florida Rock Industries. So, Florida Rock Industries, FRP, hence the FRP Holdings. So the Baker family used to run the Florida Rock Industries, which was a multibillion-dollar company. In '06, housing was hot. They got approached by Vulcan. They got a bid, and they said this bid is too good. We have fiduciary to our minority shareholders. <br><br>We don't want to sell this, but it is not just us even though they own a lot of Florida Rock Industries. They said, "We needed to do the right thing for our shareholders," and they sold the company to Vulcan Materials. That was one instance where someone would approach them with a bid. They weren't looking to sell. Someone approached them with a bid that they thought was very attractive and they took the bid. The second time that happened was in 2018. Blackstone, for the last ten years, has been approaching everyone who owns a warehouse portfolio that's more than four million square feet. They've accumulated, I think about a billion square feet at this point of warehouses.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> I live in a one-bedroom apartment in New York City. I think if it was a two-bedroom they may have approached me about turning it into a warehouse and making a bid on it.<br><br><strong>Bill:</strong> So, Blackstone approached them and they went out and got an opinion from investment bank and they said, "Okay, we'll sell it to you but it has to be the absolute highest end of our valuation." So, if you look at the proxy that was filed when they sold the warehouse portfolio for $359 million to Blackstone in 2018, there's a lot of background of how much time, it took them about a year of going back forth in negotiating. <br><br>I think Blackstone visually pushes them for $300 million. They're like, "No, it has to be 359," and they got the deal done at 359. So, this is a family, and we have a long conversation with them over time, where they said that given a high enough price, every asset is for sale. So, there's a history of the families that only Florida Rock Industries when they got approached by Vulcan. And it seems like they are always selling when they're getting a really good price. So, I think that taking away perhaps 90% of this High inside ownership will control families for real estate companies. <br><br>Because they could kind of treat it like, this is our family business, go away, we don't want to be bothered. And then if you look at also their GNA. The GNA runs about 6$ million a year. And by my estimate, this pool of assets is about $700 million. So, if you were going to get money to a real estate private equity. In that sense, you're getting your pay no preferred and you're paying eighty basis point management fee and you get the legal quiddity. Again, I'm constantly looking at what can I get in a private market and what can I get in a public market? And in my opinion. This is a much better approach, this is a much cheaper, much better, and cost-effective way to get this kind of high-quality real estate exposure in the public market. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Fantastic. I'm with you. I hadn't thought of putting it like that but eighty basis points, annually of the management fee as you call it, versus if you went to Blackstone and you took someone with this track record of two sales, maybe selling warehouse in 2018 wasn't the top of the market but they've got a very good price for it. That history, you'd be paying two and twenty in a heartbeat, right? Eighty basis points for student training, that's great. Lots of places to go here. But again, this is a real estate company. So I think there are lots of interesting things to talk about here, but we don't have to make it too crazy complex. Right? There's real estate, we need to value it. We can talk about interesting optionality, but I think the most important thing is the share price is fifty-five right now. You mentioned REIT NAV is around $90. Let's talk about what goes into the NAV around $90 per share. <br><br><strong>Bill:</strong> Sure. And I think, why do we start with the royalty business, right? That's interesting. This is probably one of the harder assets. I think most real estate <br>people could value a multi-family. They put a copyright on it, they put a dollar per square foot on it. And the Royalty is kind of a different beast. From my conversation with the Bake family over the years, we've owned this since 2015, so we've gotten to know them very well and they've been very candid in terms of feedback and whatnot. In a sense, they said that given the choice of buying a multi-family or a warehouse. <br><br>Like a four and a half cap rate or whatever you want to call it. They would rather buy the royalty business at the same cap rate on any given day. And let's think about why. But before we get into any of it, if you look at the historical performance of this aggregate business, they have had 200 thousand dollars of CapEx since 2006. And in that sense, I think they pulled out more than, at this point probably somewhere around 100 million dollars from 2006. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Can we just take a step back? I agree It's a great business and they've got some slides and stuff, but I just wanted to find for listeners who haven't dug into the filing chip. What is the royalty business? What is the aggregate business? <br><br><strong>Bill:</strong> Absolutely, fantastic. So Peter Lynch. This goes to the accumulation of knowledge. I found this couple of weeks as I read Peter Lynch's book, ONE UP ON WALL STREET. And Peter Lynch on One UP ON WALL STREET very bizarrely mentioned the aggregate business is one of the businesses out there. Because you get it. It's literally like you're buying a ton of sand, gravel, crushed stones and it's worth next to nothing. There's no value for these assets and that is the inherent molt of an aggregate business. Because it cost you probably $10 a ton but if you want to ship it fifty miles, the trucking causes $10 a ton. So, you kind of draw a circle, and within that radius, you have a ton of pricing power. <br>If you're doing a construction project, say in New York City. You'll never go to Chicago to buy rock. It doesn't matter how good the rocks are. You won't even go to New Jersey because by the time you bring it over it's going to cost you more to buy it locally.<br><br>So, these are at worst local oligopolies. A lot of times the industry is very consolidated. There's more Marietta and bulking. And then there are some players like Cemex and a few other French boys, but they're local at worst local, either local monopolies whole duopolies or local all accomplished logo, got these awards that you could get. Yes, and the other thing is, there's a very strong in [inaudible] angle to it. It's probably five or six years for you to get a permit approval because let's face it. Right? Like everyone will love it. Lovely neighborhood. They don't want a big rock quarry in that backyard and heavy trucks and you know, noised us and you got, you know, rocks falling off and like it just like there's not a curb appeal. So we love messing to be assets because what it means is that basically, your chance of new supply coming onto the market is very, very well. So if you got a portfolio that's already cash flowing, that's already been mine, that's got a minimum of a 60-year life, that with half a billion tons of rocks of reserves, that's incredibly valuable.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> And so FRP they own these quarters, these are accurate, they own them, but correct me if I'm wrong, they don't operate them, right. They'll spend Vulcan, you mentioned they sold a lot of these to Vulcan in 2006. But some of the ones they still own the least the Balkan and Vulcan just paste them the pure profit they get. I think it's a percentage of sales. Volumes monster. <br><br><strong>Bill:</strong> Yeah. So, this is the other aspect. And you know that, that, that why they're there's so Bhisma so beautiful. It's a pure top-line royalty, right? Like, like we they never disclose the actual percentages, but we estimate that it's about 10%. So 10% of the top line. So there's no cost overrun, there's no inflationary concern where you know, your labor cost goes up or equipment cost goes up. If anything, you know, inflation is so the top of mind, this, this is probably one of the best assets to own my opinion, in an inflationary environment, right? Because, you know, inflation goes through this, this an asset that naturally has a lot of pricing power, they could usually, usually increase prices by three 4%, like GE CPI plus two, right? So you could beat inflation. And there's no like I said, you know, I look back to 2006, I think there was like, $200,000, of CapEx in the entire business, that that threw off Kozue I guess, like around $100 million, or royalty income.<br><br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yep. Perfect. So as you said, this is a great business for inflation, because especially what they own, they're just taking a percentage of the royalties, local ngapi, as you said, The Rock it's not very expensive to mine and sells. But if you want to transport it more than 50 miles or something to transport costs are going to eat into all the costs. So you get nice pricing power and everything. Let's talk valuation, right. So great business. How do you look at the value of this? And I think this is one of four different pieces of value, just so people can keep that in mind as we do the sum of the parts. How do you look at the value of this business?<br><br><strong>Bill:</strong> So if you look at you know, a company itself has kind of, you know, in their investor day presentation, they have a great investor presentation, and they have kind of said that you know, more Marietta and Vulcan are good comparables, right? And they use Evie to EBIT up metric. But the reality with this is that I think you really shouldn't be using Evie to EBIT, right? Because they have no CAPEX, I suppose. Right? And Vulcan has CAPEX, right. So I think if you look at more Marietta and Vulcan, I think they trade at over 20 times, which will give you invert that that's about a 5% cap rate. Right. So So, on a run-rate basis, this business royalty business is doing about $10 million, in royalty income. Now, the reality is that all you're doing is you're sitting around cutting, you know, royalty check, right, your staff, the satellite with a little bit of extra kind of GNA, overhead, whatever they want to sell at. This is probably a 98% EBIT margin type of business. Right. So you can use the revenue as like. <br><br>So if you do 10 million divided by 5% cap rate, right? I mean, that gets you to two to about $200 million, roughly, right. And now there's, there's more to it, right, they just pass it, we just pass it infrastructure plan, right. And spending on infrastructure projects has got to go up to 20%. It's commonly expected that, you know, on the investor day, they mentioned that we could probably see very large increases in pricing, and about 5% increase in volume, right. And that will probably translate into the royalty Inc, you know, revenue hitting about 12 million in the next two years. So you go out two years, you know, 12 million on a five cap. Now you're in that I think I think you're in a 240 range, right? Like, you're in a 240 range. So, but there's there's more to this business, right? There's more to this business, there's a terminal value component to this, right. Like, it's like, what step? It takes about 5% cap rate, like, Is that appropriate? Well, there's 60 year life, there's a 60 year life, right? When you DCF ever out, right? It like if you run the DCF with like a 4% price increase, and at 5% initial yield, like like that, that's a very, very reason because you're actually getting a probably like a 9% return on asset by owning this by holding on to it for six years. And you know, like we'd get really technical, it's probably worth like, it's probably got 100 year old life because as you dig down, you tend to find more rocks. Like from a county perspective, you can't really record it, right. But typically, when you dig down, you find more rocks, right? There's probably 100 year life there. Now there's a little more because they own to, they own all the land. When when the mining gets completed, they own all the land. And what's super interesting is that they own a site down in Florida in Fort Myer, where, where this like so big picture, they own 19,000 acres of land in Georgia in Florida and being a real estate nerd. Like I've actually physically seen all these rock quarries in person, right.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yeah, I have seen pictures of it you know, out there with hardhats.<br><br><strong>Bill:</strong> So what's interesting is that there is a parcel of land and Fort Myer, where they're going to dig down and then this area is going to fill what this turquoise blue water, and it's been zone 401 luxury waterfront lakefront. Like it's the best business that I come upon, right? Because someone's paying you to dig out the rock and create an artificial lake for you. And then you now could sell the lakefront lots, right? Like I don't know a better business, than that. Right. And, you know, what we see on Zillow is that landlords down in that neck of the woods will go for probably, you know, we saw on a one-acre lot, probably one and a half million right today. And you figure but they won't be able to sell till 2028. So if you DCF that back at 12%, right, you know, with like little 3% annual price increases on it, you know, that gets us to about $16 million for that, for that what we should be able to get about $130 million in 2028. Right? Yep. And that's something that there's another kind of code for 1000 acres in Brooksville, which a few years ago was probably a depressed area, but with you know, Florida being so hot like it's about an hour north of Tampa. <br><br>I mean, that could potentially become like a housing development right? And we valued at 20 million. I think, you know, that's just like a little bit further away, right? So I think if you add everything up like it, you, you get to a high two hundred, three, you know, high 200. So like, right around that 300 million. But what's important to understand about this asset is that we've owned this company since 2015, right? Every year we sit down to do an evaluation, we're like, oh, like, like, yeah, they took more rocks out of the ground. They took like another 6 million or eight No, and then like tons of rocks out and around, but like the values increase, right? Because of that, because of that pricing power. Because that ability to keep pushing 4% cpi plus two and this is an acid that took us a long time to like understand but, um, but this is, you know, I'm starting to see the world the way they view it that that that, you know, between the multifamily and this like, like, I'd rather own this and you get, and you get in the long-run exposure to Georgia and Florida like, you know, we're demographics and you know, you got all the right trends going for you.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> That can be one of the most fun things about following a company for a while where there's like one segment or one thing they do where you just wish they wouldn't do this or wish they'd do something else. The company tells you to know, you're gonna love this gonna be so good. And sometimes three years later, you look, you look back, you're like, God, damn, why did those people keep doing that? That was so dumb, but I love it when it comes this way where it's like, no, they were right, this is better. But just to put those numbers in perspective. So right now, it's about $55 per share price for the whole company. You mentioned on the very low end, the first number you threw out was 200 million. And then as you started throwing in some more things, I think you said a $300 million, there are a little under 10 million shares outstanding. So we'll just round up and call 10.<br><br>But on the lowest end, this side of the business is worth $20 per share. On the higher end, it would be pushing over $30 per share. So what's that serious numbers right? Well, we've only talked about this one segment. And we've already got somewhere between 40% over 40% to over 50% of the value of the company. I think that's good on the royalty business. The second part, I'm just going to throw out the company, they have no recourse debt that you have debt, but it's all at the property level, not at the level, they've got $170 million or so of cash and 1600 70. I'll do the math for you. 10 10 million shares are under outstanding. That's about $17 per share. Do you want to say anything else on the cash? Because we will come back to it later when we discuss it? <br><br><strong>Bill:</strong> No not really. I mean, I think I think that I think one of your questions is like the opportunity costs of the cash, right? <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Let's come to that later. Because I want to establish some of the parts and I just wanted to jump through the cash because you add that to the royalty business. And now we're talking like, Hey, we're at least $40 per share value. And we haven't even talked about the things that I think most real estate investors know this company for and get excited about. So let's dive into that. They've got a lot of real estate projects, asset management, JV. Let's talk about the last pieces of some of the parts here.<br><br><strong>Bill:</strong> Sure. So I think this is a little bit hard to do verbally. You know, I think I think if you look at some of the photos, you know, they own a few multifamily projects, most of them Washington DC in an area by the National Baseball Stadium, and it's so they don't eight multifamily assets, right. And the way to think about is that there's a DC waterfront play, right. So Washington DC, kind of revitalize the baseball area that was kind of when the very rundown industrial area. And there's a lot of both private and public capital that went into it. And there was a couple called for the city for city enterprise that build out a big kind of mixed-use multifamily office that got bought by Brookfield, right. <br><br>And where their asset sits is they sit on the water between the Anacostia River and the Washington National Baseball Stadium. So inherently like Buffett talks about moats all the time, right? They're like, Oh, you want to own own own businesses with a moat? It's like, it's like, what is a physical book? A physical moat is a body of water, right? Where people can attack you right in the real estate business of moat is some sort of geographic constraint, right? Where, where people can't build anymore, right? So if you're right on the edge of the water, you got a real moat because they can't build anymore. Like you got that you got the river view. Right. And that's what gets me excited about the location right when you're in this upcoming like it's not up and coming, because it's already like one of them, you know, one of the fate favorite neighborhoods in Washington, DC. And what makes it cool is that you got this Riverwalk down there, you got an entire kind of park outdoor park here, you're about a 15-20 minute walk to Capitol Hill. <br><br>So you'd like there's, you will get the staffing, right. Like, like a lot of people who live in that area, is that they're there? 15% I think there's like military, there's, there's like if you watch NCIS, like on the outside, like, like, that's right next to there, right? You got Capitol Hill, a lot of people are lobbyists who live in these buildings. You got a lot of big four accounting people, folks who were there and those categories are about half of the residents. And what's most impressive about this asset, right people talk about, okay, like when you when we stress test, it's like How bad did it get right? Like, doing COVID? You know, that's 79 you know, which is what a building's on on the award of their occupancy like was only down about 1% And they kept red flag right, but it is one of the most impressive for an urban location. That's one of the most impressive performances that I've seen and you know, we like, we editorial position when we saw that, and then if you look at the mirror, which is a new building right next door, they went from zero to 45%. Lease and 2021. In q2, right, like they, it was leasing up with people using iPhones to light life, you know, kind of lie, like to give people life tours through iPhones.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> It's easy to forget, I mean, q2 is before that was right before the vaccine roll up really got going. Right. Like, by July, people thought that we were going back to normal, and then Delta and Omicron came back. But then q2, I mean, that is the right at the start of the vaccine days. So that was still a very tough time in New York City. I know, you know, New York City. Well, that was the end of hey, get four months free on a one-year lease in New York City, April and May were right at the end. So for them to go zero 45. That's pretty impressive. <br><br><strong>Bill:</strong> But I think I think you're thinking April of 21. This is<br>2008 was April 2020. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Oh, yeah. That is way, way worse. <br><br><strong>Bill:</strong> But there's like no clarity. There's no clarity. They went from zero to 45. In q2, like when we were just locking down like, like, if you think about do you want to lease multifamily in an urban location, but this was like, not the time, and they got 45% lease in one quarter. I mean, now-<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> I completely misread the investor presentation. That's way more impressive than I was, you know what I think it was I had a mental block that there's no way anybody could rent out a multifamily deal in April 2020. That's probably, yeah.<br><br><strong>Bill:</strong> So I mean, it's like, I think if you start with the worst case, and you work backward, you say, How bad could it get? Right? This is the worst they could get. And they have this type of performance. So So I think in this category, on dancing on the marathon, it's kind of easy to value, right? Like the marathon when it's stabilized. There was a press release that said, If valued at $150 million, and then you can kind of like work through the 88 million that was a mortgage then. Yep. And like arrive at a value. You know, docks, I mean, I would generally use a $7.3 million. Noi, like, like, that's what we think when we kind of normalize like, what that will be an El Cap rate assumption is about four and a quarter, right, like, most multifamily in the US Tre in a forehand, though, with the Sunbelt being in the threes, right? And this is, you know, these buildings were built in 16 and 20. Right? <br><br>So these are brand new I trophy Class A, like a great location, waterfront, right. So, between these two buildings, we get to about 97 $98 million, like, like, caught 969 $7 million of equity value for those two buildings alone. Right. And then there are two more land parcels right next to it, that they could build without you that at about $51 million. And there's a lot of conflicts, you know, we've done a lot of digging, where there are land transactions sold in, in those areas that were away from the water. And they're generally, you know, we're valuing those at court, you know, 85 $85, a square foot, and those were from years ago, right, like, as a naval gets further build out that the value increases, using a comp further away from the river. Right. So we think that's very reasonable. And then there's 1800 hash rate. And Brian St. You know, we value that, that at 38. And Colet $59 million. And that's very simple. We're just using book value. Now, when you think about a real estate development, like you, you know, pour the foundation as you build that out as you stabilize and do the interior and lease it up, right. But the value gets created on a, you know, daily, weekly, monthly basis, right. But because of GAAP accounting, you say, it is worth you know, I like it is worth this initial book value. And then there's a quarter where they'll issue a press release and say, Oh, you created you double your equity value in this development project, right. And that all happens once.<br><br>And that's what happened with America, right? The marathon, I think in q1 or q2 of 21, when it stabilized, they came out with a big press release that says, either 40 $50 million of GAAP net income and you gotta adjust it for like the joint venture value, right? But nonetheless, what I'm getting at is that there's a big headline, there's a big press release, that's going to say, you know, there's a big gap income, a big step up, and what that what that is supposed to convey is that that's how much value they created through the development process. And they usually get that value from the bank appraiser when they put a permanent mortgage on it, right? <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yeah no, they don't those can be my question. So where are you getting those equity values? It's not like they're, they're pulling them out of nowhere. It's either Hey, we sold A piece of this to a JV partner and this is the equity value that the value that or more likely, hey, you know, it's on our books for 80 million, but we just went in took out $140 million loans on this thing because it was appraised that 200 million or something is where you're pulling these numbers on the developer. So I'm pulling on the development projects, literally holding them from the 10 Q. Again, its historical cost, its historical costs from, I guess, like, but these two projects, you know, and these projects are like two to two years in two and a half years in, and they're, you know, in lease-up. And, you know, I talk a lot. <br><br>So, you know, I'll talk about catalysts a little bit, but I'll go through it, you know, they got a project down in, you know, bring Greenville, South Carolina. So now you're in like more Sunbelt territory. And those projects should do well. So if I aggregated you know, all those, all those assets, right? I got about a $297 million equity value in that in that bucket. Right. And this is net of debt, and then of JV interest, right, like, you know, there's a lot of like, so let's talk about like cat. So you do 296 divided by its nine and a half million shares that I use, if you close round it up, Bill, come on, is making the math easy. Yeah, no, make math easy. So you know, you're talking about like $30 a share in the multifamily. And this is probably one of the best portfolios because it's waterfront, it's, you know, it's in like, this really exciting neighborhood in DC, right. And like someone like watch someone like Brookfield, the home would be like a very much firewall like Avalon Bay.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> And you know, insurance company buying RD, lease style multifamily. So I think that's great. So let's just pause right here. So some of the parts, right, we've got $17 per share and net cash on the balance sheet, no recourse debt. So there's $17 per share ish, then we've got call it $30 per share in the royalty business that we mentioned earlier if you include the value of the fort Meyers land and everything. It's called $30. There, and then a little bit around $30, as well in the multifamily. So we've got 30 plus 30, plus 17 if I'm doing my math right on the fly, that 77. And I was probably conservative because I was using tenants at nine and a half. And then there's probably another 100 million of miscellaneous, you know, office warehouses and stuff. I don't think there's anything too chunky in there that we need to dive into. But again, that's another $10 per share, add all together, that's 87. Again, I was using 10, seven, nine half. So we're at your 90, Is that about right at that point? <br><br><strong>Bill:</strong> Yes, that's that's about right. And I think one thing you may want to just take away from is that they do have some deferred income taxes, you know, as you sell real estate, and what they've done is they've done a really good job, either using 1031 changes or investing in opportunity zones for those taxes, right. So I think the actual record, the book value is something in the 50 $60 million range, but like, you're not gonna pay it today. And the opportunity's own has a lot of energy is where you hold it for 10 years, you kind of almost indefinitely, the further so I MPV it, and I call it 25 million, right? So you probably want to take two and a half dollars away from it, you know, and I think we're in the right ballpark like, like I have, in my model about an $89 value, like, you know, court like we're in the right ballpark for it.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> And look, if it's 86 versus 90, the share price is 55. So that's fine. So let me get into my pushback here, right? I think this is great. Because the thing that jumps out is me it's really hard to you know, people talk about the pre mortems, right, where you kill an investment for us, it's really hard to see how you do poorly too poorly here, right? You've got to a management team that seems committed to shareholder value that's done well over time. They're not raking their pockets with fees of $17 per share of net cash on the balance sheet that gives you a long way for downside protection. You know, dc, dc already leased apartment buildings. This is a great asset portfolio. So it's tough to kill yourself on the downside. But the things I worry about here are things like first opportunity cost, right?<br><br>Okay, I worried that this is an investment where 10 years from now you and I are you're beating me at croquet or maybe I've gotten better and I'm beating you but 10 years from now we're out in the croquet fields and I say oh, hey, how's that for pH doing? Say, oh, you know, it's great. And i ne v is at 180. Now it's at 140 or something right? So that's not too bad two and a half over 10 years but that's not outstanding, you know, we didn't make any great alpha so my first pushback would be just Are we really gonna make a lot of alpha here short of the you wake up in three months and they've decided to sell the whole company thing? <br><br><strong>Bill:</strong> Sure. I'm in I think that. So what's important is so let's talk about catalysts, right? Like why does it make the gap close? And I think that if you know. The way that the so a couple of things, let's talk about Catalyst, and let's talk about their track record. And I think that tracker is also really, really important items to talk about, right? I think that if you look at how they've allocated capital since 20, oh, 2015, you know, when we sort of own this company, every project that they've done, they have achieved by my estimate, open, you know, 20% IRR or higher. Okay. They, you know, that that applies to multifamily development that applies to warehouse development that applies to the opportunity to sick residential, you know, homebuilding lot development, where they're getting 20% IRR on those projects as well. Right. <br><br>So I think, I think when you and they're very, very selective, right, like the process is that they've seen 100 deals, why am I talking with them is leasing 100 deals, and they've only invested about a handful there. And that was since they sold the portfolio to Blackstone, right? So I think I think that's key. Because if you're invested with family where they could get, they could get you 20% IRR on the capital that they do deploy, right. They're very conservative, very selective. But when they do put capital to work, you're getting points in IRR on it. Right? I would say that I'm willing to bet that over time, people will start to agree with me because of that track record, right. Like we're talking five years from now. I think people will see a lot of these assets stable, you know, stabilize and, and there's also a, on the capital side, there's a resource conversion, right, I think I think it was Marty Whitman, who coined the term resource conversion, right? Like you take land that's thrown off any cash flow, you put a building on it, right, now throws off, you know, call it like seven or $8 million of net operating income and you put something on it, right? Like, you could, you could, you could get $5 million. <br><br>And were like, even as soon as two years from now, like, fast forward, you're in next year, right? You're in 2023. By my investment, I think they could do $35 million of FFL, or, you know, operating cash flow, right, and most REITs, most high-quality multifamily REITs, trade at 2530 times FFL. And that's just, you know, you could pull up like, you know, the big industrial reads, The Big multifamily reads as a high quality read, will trade at 2530 times for multiple, right. So in the short term, there's that catalyst potentially working for you, right? In that, you know, I like to own these assets, when it's hidden land value, that doesn't grow up in cash flow, and over three years, it gets converted into cash flow, and then people could put a multiple on and say, oh, yeah, that office is cheap. Right. So I think that's, that's one of the mechanisms. Right.<br><br>The other angle is that you know, you mentioned, the opportunity costs $170 million of cash, right? You know, they're putting that to work. And, and part of the reason why they have this cash is that it's so good at these developments, you know when they do a development project, that sometimes they'll finance it with both equity and preferred. And when it gets they will, as they get that preferred back now, they got more cash on the balance sheet, right. They recently identified a couple of projects that so remember why this is a company that has its roots in warehouse development, right, they built up this warehouse portfolio from nothing to fully own square foot and solar devices. So they recently gain, you know, the, they have the rights to about 2 million square foot warehouse. So you figure to develop, you know, usually buy the land, I think you know, what, they've been buying it for about 10 $15 a square foot, right, but it's worth 20 30,000 square foot, but will cost him probably another nine hours to to to kind of build the shell build the foundation and get that lease. So there will be a use of very productive use to that to that capital. And, you know, they'll probably do 40% return on the asset on that deployment into the warehouse base.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> No, that's perfect. That was going to be my next question on how they pay cash. Let me just ask two questions about the warehouse. Yeah, so obviously the first sale of the warehouse they did from the kind of 2010 to 2015 and six blocks, and that was great. Do you know what the IRR that they invested that they kind of realized? That portfolio was? <br><br><strong>Bill:</strong> Sure I mean, I think I think the cost basis was about 180 mil like some somewhere in that 180 to 200 million, and they sold it to three for 359. Right? And a lot of it was built now keep in mind, they're also collecting, I think was doing about $21 million. And then I bring a con when they sold it right? They were getting $20 million of cash flow every single year and they sold it for this essentially double what they pay for. And if you do the IR and something like that you're like, in the teens, and the thing is these guys, the family doesn't use a lot of leverage, right? Like, they use a lot of leverage, like we probably have an IR-like lever IR in the 20. <br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> If Bill and Andrews optimally leveraged finance shop had done what they did, we would have been in the 30%. No, that's great. So second question, this warehouse portfolio that they're about to build up, you mentioned, hey, they got the land for about $10 per square foot, you think the lands was $20 per square foot, and they're gonna go build it out, you know, $90 per square foot of cost, but the build-out and I are sure at the end will be very successful as it was a bit. I mean, my pushback there would be alright, these guys have been great at developing but it's not like the warehouse game is exactly a secret at this point. Like who's selling to them for $10 a square foot when there's a warehouse by at this point? How are they getting access to this?<br><br><strong>Bill:</strong> Financial question and this is where I think that the thing about like, their experience and where they have a lot of knowledge, right, they're, they're like, very, in the DC, Maryland, like in the middle Atlantic area, that's there, that's their backyard, right? That's where they have a real edge. And, and they're, you know, historically, from a corporate perspective, they built 4 million square feet now everyone's looking to do to the warehouses, right? Because that's, that's one of the hottest asset classes, the reality is that when you buy something for $10 a square foot, you got to take the time to get that entitle. And get that, you know, get that approved, get that ready to build, right. And, and that entitlement process, remember going back to the $6 million GNA, right?<br><br>That's what you're paying these guys for. Right? What you're paying these guys for is that anyone could buy a parcel of land, but to get it to shovel ready. There's a value creation process. And, and, and that's part of it, like like, it's like, what why did you buy that? 10? I think one, they found a good deal. But like, maybe someone else may have to pay 15 $20 a square foot, but to take it through entitlement. You know, there's a, there's a time component, and then there's a cost component to it. Where I mean, frankly, you know, when I spoke with them, they think that you got shovel ready land in the middle attic right now. It's probably 35 $40 a square foot. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's, you know, we own another warehouse company. So we're very, like, you know, in tune with, like, what land costs, what construction costs, like what rent is in each market. So this is, you know, this is a market where I, you know, I remember correctly, I think I think for a brand new class, a warehouse, you're getting $7, a square foot net, right? So if you could buy land, a tenant will take it through entitlement and built, you know, the shelf when it was like you're getting your building to 7% cap rate, and the warehouse cap rate is probably, you know, in that market life on a quarter today, you know, so like, you're creating a ton of value, creating value by developing these warehouses.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Let me ask this question. You mentioned earlier, the private market valuation versus public market valuation, and people go, I put this in my notes, like, I can point to a lot of REITs, where I think they would say, hey, our Private Market Value is a lot higher than our public market value. You know, the one I put in the notes was SL grade, which is all New York City. Now, that's New York City, which has its unique things. They've been saying it for a year, they've been pointing out, hey, like, our navy is way higher than our stock price do they bought, they buy back shares pretty aggressively. They have slides, they say, look, we've been saying this for years. And every time like, this is not some illusory thing. We sell assets at or above our nav there are, you know, there are lots of comps, where the building next door sells to us for a 3% cap rate in our nav has our building a three and a half percent cap rate.<br><br>So they've been saying something similar for years, right? It's actually kind of I think it's along the same lines. There. I think they say their nav is like 115 and their stock 70, which is kind of the same as you say, nav here is 90 and mph is 55. So I guess my two questions here are, again, opportunity costs, why are pH over one of the many other REITs that are trading at a discount to private market value. And then the second thing is just as an investor, whenever I look at these things, like I get it, like I can see and not just every SLG Bernado all these guys, I can see that the public market, the private markets are a lot higher than public market. But I just say like, what is the public market missing? <br><br><strong>Bill:</strong> Public markets are smart, they're not going to discount a whole sector for no reason. Is it just like, they think cap rates are unsustainable? Is there something else they're missing? Well, I think I think so. That's a good question. And obviously, this is something that I pay a lot of attention to, in my premortem analysis. Right. And I think I think in the case of Vornado so great, I think specifically has to do with that these are office assets, right? And if you look at the last 10 years, kind of rent growth, what you have to pay in terms of concession and leasing commissions and TR it like get an office lease-up in New York City. What the actual owners keep hasn't gone up a lot. Right? Like, like, it's just been a very challenge. And then you got COVID. And this whole work from home, I think I. So a better way think about is terminal value is extremely important in real estate because you're naturally buying assets at, you know, caught, like 20 times cash flow, right. So, you know, what, if there are any sorts of doubt on terminal value risk, right, automatically, it kind of doesn't work. People may not want to own that, right. So like, let's, let's, let's kind of walk through this, what gets me excited about FRP? Is what let's, let's look you got an infrastructure bill, right for the next five years, that's going to result in in in strong demand for aggregates. Right. And then the other thing is, what how would you impair you know, 14 sites and Georgian floor of aggregate royalty business? It's like trying to try to nuke that right?<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> If you want to get crazy, like one of the recent targets I had Vadim on and we talked beat that and one of his things was, hey, you know, I can't they're gyms. And there's an out-there risk where we all go into the metaverse or we invent a pill that you take once a day and get you super fit. I mean, we could invent a risk here where Georgia and Florida Florida are underwater, five years from now from global warming or something right now. That's great. But you can invent some strange receipt. One thing, my wife always talks like, oh, we should buy real estate, and sometimes we should buy an apartment. Sometimes like, Yeah, we should let's get a rent payment out of here. But other times like, Well, it sounds nice when you've been in New York City, and you're writing the 80s to 2020. Boom. But if you did Detroit real estate from 80 to 2020. I don't think anybody thought Detroit was like going downhill at the time, but it wouldn't have been great. So I don't know. I'm kind of rambling, but I do hear you on that. I agree with the Georgia Florida feature.<br><br><strong>Bill:</strong> I think they joined Florida. The I think given the let's say, for the next 1020 years in terms of kind of the tax regime in terms of demographics, like where people migrating to the demand for homebuilding housing affordability I think, I think you don't have any of that New York City, like will people go back to the office like, like, you just don't have any doubts. Right. And I think I think that's a critical factor. And like, you know, people pitching me will bill what several times is real cheap, right? And I've been pitched that name for the last 10 years. And it's been cheap in some departments. Oh, this is super important. And I don't mean to like, you know, talk negative about surcharging, Messrs but I think-<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> I'm just laughing because once every two years I look at Sarah Taj on the same thing. I'm like, it looks cheap. But there's a lot of heavy lift in here. This is it's too hard, man.<br><br><strong>Bill:</strong> Well, there's, there's a there's something to be said about owning an asset where you can sleep well at night, right? You pay a 5% cap rate for 20 Multiple, but you could wake up next year, we got five years from now 10 years, 10 years from now you're like like they got pricing power. This is not being impaired, right? Versus like retail, right? Like, even five to 10 years ago. But you know, I had this conversation when people say, Hey, Bill, what are you looking at sabotage is so cheap on some of my interests me less when you're buying into a melting ice cube or potential melting ice cube.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Yeah. No, I, the older I get, you know, Warren Buffett said, I think there's Buffett time is the friend of the wonderful business and the enemy of the poor business. And it sounds so trite, but the older I get those trite Warren Buffett sayings they have so much and I think one of the reasons buying good businesses buying good assets, like your with fPh versus probably midway Cirrus is does have some good assets. But the nice thing is if you buy it for Pah, and it is a good business, and I think you've said you've made a good case like the value just keeps growing. So yeah, maybe you're 55 to 90 get doesn't close until they announced the deal 10 years from now, but guess what, the value just keeps growing over time. So as maybe the discount stays the same, but it just keeps going. And that's just such a nice tailwind to have behind you.<br><br><strong>Bill:</strong> Well not meant by going back to our original math, right. Like quite say it takes 10 years for you to close this gap right to I don't know whether like investors paid now for like, the actual prime market value or you get or you get, you know, get bought out or something, you know, something some sort of event happens. You know, if you think the private market value could compound at 10% a year, right and why 10% Usually, when you put leverage, you know, usually you put mortgages on a good multifamily asset, right, you could usually get to about a 10% lever IRR. That's usually from my experience. I mean, that's why pension funds endowments, the big insurance companies they all love these multifamily assets, right because we put 50% mortgages on it with like three, three and a half percent debt on it and get by To 3% rent increases, you could get to a 10% lever IRR on Yeah, right. So, so the anger business, you know, you get a 5% yield, you get like a 4% price increase, you get to around a 9% return on that without the use of any leverage, right. <br><br>And then any sorts of development that they do in the other pocket, they tend to hit, you know, 15 20% IRR, the only project that they haven't done well is this kind of like, mixed-use retail slash office asset. And that's been a little slow to lease-up. But that's like 1% of the Aum. I mean, other than that, and then all their projects since 2015, have been home runs. And I think that's the aspect that the market doesn't necessarily appreciate, right? And I just kind of look at it and I say, I kind of look at FRP my portfolio like, Why do I own it? Like I kind of view, it as drafting, like a really good offensive lineman, right? Like, they're not the like, like, this is a position. That's where you're like, you draft a really good left tackle, like someone like Joe Thomas of the Cleveland Browns, and you're like, he's got a lie, you know, a lot of value for you for the next 10 years.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> How can you argue with the last 10 years of Cleveland Brown football results, Bill? Come on, you can't bring the Cleveland Browns up here.<br><br><strong>Bill:</strong> Well, I'm talking specifically about Joe Thomas, who I never miss.<br>I know I this is, I agree.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> This is one of those. I mean, I'm just getting a chance to go through the podcast, but it's almost like everything you look at it's the same way I view charter in my portfolio, like everything you look at, I think charter can do mid-double digits IRR pretty easy for the next couple of years. Like I feel so common in terminal value. Everything I look at, it has to be compared to buying more charter and for you, I'm sure it's similar to FRP His I'm getting to that 40% discount to NAV the NAV is gonna grow 10% There's no recourse debt so it's really hard to get it you know, like anything you can do that sleep at night double-digit IRR like it's tough, tough to beat that. Let me ask you, I've got two more questions here. First, as you know, I share repurchases I'm just obsessed with share repurchases. I love share repurchases. I and I always find it interesting when a company goes from aggressive share repurchases to slow share repurchases. And the company, I tweeted this out, you know, they said, Hey, in 2020, we did a nice job buying shares back our stock was screaming cheap, and we took advantage and I think they retired about 5% of their shares outstanding, I'd have to check my math, but they didn't show buying back shares. They're not buying back shares today, despite the undervaluation. We've discussed a great balance sheet, no recourse debt, they say, Hey, we're not buying back shares. And that's fine. They've got some projects, we talked about the warehouse projects that can deliver solid errors, but it does strike me as interesting. If the company isn't buying back shares. And their history is when they're undervalued, they buy pretty aggressively. Why should I be buying chairs today? Does that make sense? <br><br><strong>Bill:</strong> Yeah, no. That's very valid. And this is something that took me a long time to kind of like understand and one so this right, so first of all, like, not every company is like a John Malone share buyback optimizer. Right. And, and, you know, my understanding is that, if you will get previous, the higher range of previous share buybacks, it's in the high for the high 40s. Right. So you could make an argument that at $55, right, like, you could potentially where they will stop, I'm not sure it will probably be a 49 hour like, as a high forehand home. Right is where so you're maybe sent off. So that's, that's just another reference point. Um, in terms of like, why not? I think that you know, like, like people say, yeah, there's so many companies out there trading at some parts discount, right? Like, why on this one, right. They're trying to solve that problem. Right. It's like, I think, I think sometimes shareholders could kind of be like, like, oh, like why would I want to own it? I think what they're trying to do, I think they have a board with some competent people on it, who told him well, you know, what, like for you to get fair value, you need to convert these assets into cash flow and assets. So, in the long run, Wall Street could you know put a cap rate or put an FFL multiple on it and you will trade to full value and you know, another company that we own is a company called Griffin industrial which is now converted into inducing Realty trust, right. And get belly owns a lot of that company. <br><br>You know, I spoke to Mario Bao and at a conference very briefly, and you know, Gabelli was very public about asking them to buy back shares right. If you look at what happened with that company, have they bought back more shares? They will own a lot of land in Connecticut with what very low cash flow right that the market would not care about. But instead, they pivoted into Lehigh Valley. They went into Charlotte, they sold land, and in Hartford, Connecticut, and they use 1031. They what diversify went into another market now their warehouse platform, right? I think when it comes to real estate, they're unique. trades in terms of like, how do you this is what I think about daily, right? As you mentioned, charter Charter is a deeply liquid stock where you could wake up on any given day, you could buy back as many shares as you want, right? There's, there's, I mean, there is trading liquidity, right. And I think like how you solve that, how you close that gap, in the long run, is, you go about the route of resource conversion, right, you convert your land into cash flow and assets that the market could put a cap rate on or multiple on, and then you build up enough of it, where and then it brings in enough investors if you so if you bought our shares, you like, you know, further creates a liquidity problem, right? Like, like, like, as a value investor, you're like, you're like, Yeah, but like, if you're at a discount, like, like, just my dad, you create so much more value. Three, I was like, at the same time, why, like, if someone who's big want to buy, you know, build a tunnel in opposition, it's gonna take a long time, I think, I think there is an element and 10 years ago, I was said, That's hogwash. Like I don't care, right? But trading liquidity and who could own the stock makes a huge difference in terms of the discount that you trade yeah?<br><br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> No, I 100%. Agree. And as you're saying here, like, as we're talking, it's almost the end of the trading day, the stocks traded 3000 shares, right? So that's 55 shares, I'll make the math easy on myself, we're talking $150,000 of trading value, like, yeah, it'd be nice if they were buying back shares at this discount, but they can't buy back all of the shares, right? So it's gonna be a drop in the bucket, you know, for these companies. I'm with you. Five years ago, I would have said, Hey, screw that they need to buy back shares. And I'm like, Well, look, there are dynamics behind this, I'm sure they're trying to create value. And honestly, with that trading volume, it might not even be worth the headache to try to retire shares versus Hey, let's go do 20% IRR is to build out the next great warehouse platform and we'll sell it again to Blackstone in 2024. And make a huge premium something. Last thing I said a couple of times. One of the nice things here is great DC multifamily assets, right $17 per share in cash on the balance sheet. I think pretty inflation resistant, you know, everybody's talking about inflation these days, you've got the ROTC course, multifamily should be pretty inflation resistance because your leases are turning over about every year, you're in everything. What kills you here? What keeps you up at night, when you're investing in FRP? Ah, what am I missing as a big risk here?<br><br><br><strong>Bill:</strong> I think that the, you know, what, we talked about what this continuing to trade out of this big discount in there, right? Like, like, if, if this professional, he trades at a 6% discount in there, then you may, you know, like that thing, like your return is lower. Right, like that, then. So that's one concern. You know, I tend to think, yeah.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> That doesn't kill you that just, you know, you're<br>fundamentally right. Yeah, that's just hey, you know, I'd like to do 15% annually for here, but I ended up doing 8%. Right. It's not the end of the world. It's not great, but it's up and the world is there. But it sounds like to me, you're saying it's tough to see something that kills you?<br><br><strong>Bill:</strong> It is it is. It's tough. You know. You know, my lawyers told me to alter, alter one more. Yeah. You know, lots of people said real estate, one of the reasons it's been such a great asset over the last 30 years is interest rates went from 15 to zero or something, right? You even said when you were talking about the math behind them running, building warehouses, if I remember correctly, they built it. And, all in math, they can build it to about a seven or 8% cap rate. But warehouses are worth about a 4% cap rate, and I'm just making it, so they built it real cheap. I do wonder, you know, interest rates, we get seven hikes this year or something. Interest rates are fundamental gravity is going from I'll just going up to 4%. Right? Yeah, free to go from four to six and a half percent. All of a sudden, these warehouses that we thought they were building creatively, they built value-neutral, and there's not that much margin of safety there where if interest rates are a little higher, or cap rates were a little higher, for some reason, they built out a loss. Do you worry that so much of I hate says because, again, interest rates higher inflation is higher? So the multifamily property is good, the quarries do good. But do you worry that some of it is just interest rates are so low that almost any build-out looks good right now? <br><br><strong>Bill:</strong> Yeah. So I mean, that's, I think, I think that's a great question. Right. Like, and frankly, that's a question that a lot of investors that are you know, 50 and younger, right? Or maybe like definitely 48 Yeah, they're like, never have to deal with the right like, as we've been, we've been in this since the 80s. We've been climbing interest rate environment, right. And it's something that I'm very, very common sense Enough. So let's walk through the mechanism, right? I think when you have a rising interest rate where it kills you, and this is what I saw that same group a walk, right? Usually, you get into a lot of trouble if you get a mark to market, it is not as bad. If you get a sudden need to repay the principal, that's when you get into a lot of trouble. Right. And, and I think that if you look at how they're financing it as Doc said, Marin has 12 years fixed rate of 3% interest, right? You could say if interest rates go up to 5%, tomorrow, right on a mark to market basis, you may say, oh, that's, that's worth a lot less now. Right?<br><br>I think the mitigate is that you don't have to deal with that balloon payment until 12 years from now. Yeah, and 12 years from now, if we're in a 5% interest rate environment, there's probably a pretty good chance, you're able to go from two 3% Rent decrease to five or 6% in rent increase, right? Because it probably indicates like a highly inflationary environment. So I think I think when you paint it, like, like you got to pay attention to not just the you know, the terms of the debt is just as important as the interest rate. Now, I, you know, we done an internal analysis, where I think if you get to a six cap for 6% cap rate for the multifamily and you put a 6% cap rate on the aggregate business, and kind of like impair everything else by 50% you get roughly what the what the stock is trading at today. Yep. And and I think, I think like, like if you ask most private guys, like would you want to buy a trophy waterfront class, a DC multifamily at 6% cap rate? Like I mean, I think there's gonna be a lot of people are like knocking down doors, I, you know, look into by that.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> It reminds me of a lot of times all talk to someone else, say like, oh, this company just to make it simple trades for eight times EBIT on all the columns straight for 10 times EBIT, and they'll say, and I think this company slightly better, right, let's say, Oh, well, what if it comes down to eight times? He does? And I think, you know, it sounds interesting as a pushback, because the bear case always sounds more interesting. But the answer is, well, I'm already buying an eight, so everybody else is down 20%. And I'm glad and in your case, like the market is already pricing in at a 6% cap rate. So if everything comes to a 6% cap rate, well, we got to cash in the meantime, and we're breakeven, so again, it doesn't kill you. Anyway, we're running pretty long. So I just want to last alternate for PAH I think we did a nice job covering but anything we didn't cover you wish we did anything you wish we had hit a little harder?<br><br><strong>Bill:</strong> Oh, no, I think I think I think we did a pretty good job. Maybe one last thing would be I mean, there are ways to hedge out some of that interest rate and market exposure like, you know, this is a smaller company you could buy you go 15 20% Out of money just buy puts in like an Avalon bay or like a Prologis or you could even buy 5% out of the money puts in barbarian and welcome right like like, as part of risk management for my portfolio. Like I just rolled this. And you know, my bills out here worried about giving it and then he's talking complex hedging strategies.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> No, I'm, I'm total with you know, like, again, it comes back if you're buying something for 8x. And all the peers are at 10x. Like, you could just take the market risk, or you can go hedge with peers, you know, I think I've looked at a lot with a lot of oil companies seem to imply like $55 oil and their stock price, but oil is at 90, there are ways to hedge that right. So and capture that spread again, that gets more complex. Everybody should do their work to their diligence, but I'm definitely with you there anything else that I've heard PH?<br><br><strong>Bill:</strong> No. I mean, I think I think I think we did a pretty good job covering it. And this has been a fantastic conversation. I've enjoyed it.<br><br><strong>Andrew:</strong> Hey, I know you do great work. I saw all the photos of you with the hard hats here. But this has been even better just like diving in here. This is why I love the podcasts. I mean, these things. Bill Chen is, a great real estate investor. Thanks so much for coming on. We're gonna have to have you back. So you can tell everybody your New York City apartment thesis at some point because that's a banger one as well.

But something about this particular fact pattern struck me as curious. </p><p>Reuters reported that MGI had a bidder at $<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/exclusive-buyout-firm-madison-dearborn-approaches-moneygram-with-acquisition-bid-2021-12-15/">10.50/share back in December</a>. Then, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/exclusive-moneygram-reviews-private-equity-bids-sources-2022-01-25/">in January, Reuters confirmed MGI had run a process and gotten three bids</a>. Now, I&#8217;m not an investment banker, but it seems pretty obvious if a major news outlet reports a bid and includes the price (as Reuters did in December) and the company then runs a process that attracts multiple bidders, the new bidders aren&#8217;t going to be coming in at a price under the original bid. If they decide the company is worth less than the original bid or their DD unearths something they don&#8217;t like, they&#8217;re probably more likely to just pass than go through all the effort of raising financing and putting in a bid that&#8217;s clearly inferior.</p><p>So MGI closed Monday at $9/share. If you believe the above (that any new bids would need to come in at or above the $10.50/share Reuters reported in December) and that MGI would fall to its pre-rumor price of just over $7/share if they decided not to sell, the market was putting in basically 50/50 odds that MGI would take a deal (~$1.50 up if they took a deal at $10.50, ~$1.50 down if they rejected and fell to pre-deal levels). That&#8217;s rough math; it&#8217;s possible that the market looked at three PE players making rumored bids for MGI and says &#8220;maybe we were too pessimistic at ~$7/share before the rumors started and fundamental value is actually higher.&#8221; And it&#8217;s possible that the winning bid came in materially higher than $10.50/share (i.e. we get a bidding war and a strategic comes in and pays $15/share or something). So, again, rough, simplified math; if you adjust for those odds, the market was probably saying less than 50/50 shot of MGI taking a deal.</p><p>Which just feels wrong to me. Again, you had a very reputable news outlet (Reuters) reporting a bid at a big premium and that multiple bidders were involved after the company had run a process. Insiders seemed reasonably aligned here; the company had tried to sell themselves a few years ago (t<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-moneygram-intl-m-a-ant-financial/u-s-blocks-moneygram-sale-to-chinas-ant-financial-on-national-security-concerns-idUSKBN1ER1R7">hat deal was blocked on national security concerns</a>), suggesting the board was open to a sale, and insiders across the board had just bought a decent amount of stock on the open market in November.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96b0fd3f-826b-4ca6-8580-eb7a8c5b6763_1021x456.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96b0fd3f-826b-4ca6-8580-eb7a8c5b6763_1021x456.png" width="1021" height="456" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/96b0fd3f-826b-4ca6-8580-eb7a8c5b6763_1021x456.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:456,&quot;width&quot;:1021,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:104155,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96b0fd3f-826b-4ca6-8580-eb7a8c5b6763_1021x456.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96b0fd3f-826b-4ca6-8580-eb7a8c5b6763_1021x456.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96b0fd3f-826b-4ca6-8580-eb7a8c5b6763_1021x456.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96b0fd3f-826b-4ca6-8580-eb7a8c5b6763_1021x456.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>So it all seems really obvious / easy in hindsight. In real time, it certainly wasn&#8217;t quite so easy; I had a very small position that probably should have been 10x bigger. I just kept looking at the gap between the market price (~$9/share) and the reported initial offer ($10.50/share) and saying to myself, &#8220;I have to be missing something, right? It can&#8217;t be this easy / obvious.&#8221;</p><p>Maybe MGI is unique&#8230;. but it feels to me that there are a lot of situations right now with lots of similarities to MGI that are trading at pretty large discounts that seem to imply pretty solid risk / reward in event driven names that shouldn&#8217;t have crazy market correlations.</p><p>I&#8217;ll give a few sample situations in a second, but with any opportunity set it&#8217;s worth asking &#8220;Why have the market gods presented me with this &#8216;gift&#8217;?&#8221; In the case of these event set ups, I think there are two possibilities:</p><ol><li><p>I&#8217;m just a crazy person and completely missing something</p></li><li><p>Markets<a href="https://yetanothervalueblog.substack.com/p/weekend-thoughts-anxious-and-bullish?r=a7n3"> have been absolutely brutal recently</a>, and funds aren&#8217;t willing to deploy serious risk capital after having their heads beat in for the past ~9 months.</p></li></ol><p>I obviously lean towards #2, but #1 is a real possibility!</p><p>Anyway, just to highlight the opportunity set, here are two situations I&#8217;m currently looking at that strike me as interesting / somewhat similar to the MGI set up. I&#8217;ll emphasize these are just situations I&#8217;m following; I&#8217;m not saying either of these are the best set ups in the history of the world or anything. But they do seem like very solid set ups for deals that have a decent shot of happening and/or getting bumped from here and in companies that are probably fundamentally undervalued even in the absence of a takeover.</p><ol><li><p><strong>CNR </strong>just got a <a href="https://www.bamsec.com/filing/88390222000006?cik=883902">buyout offer from their largest shareholder at $24.65/share</a>.

These are multi-billion dollar companies that trade millions of share per day, so you can&#8217;t argue &#8220;O, those are too small for real people to get involved (like you maybe could for MGI).&#8221; And these are companies with offers from financial, not strategic, buyers. Financial buyers buy for one reason: they think something is undervalued. They don&#8217;t buy because they think something is fairly valued but has material synergies with their operating business (like a strategic would do!); compare these bids to something like Cedar Fair (FUN), which <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/seaworld-says-offer-buy-cedar-fair-rejected-2022-02-16/">rejected an offer from Sea World</a>. That&#8217;s probably an interesting situation, but Sea World is clearly bidding with strategic / financial synergies in mind, which is much different than a financial acquirer coming in with no synergies and basically saying &#8220;this stock is too cheap.&#8221;</p><p>So I chose KSS and CNR for specific reasons, but I can list probably five to ten other stocks that fit into a similar bucket right now. The market just seems rich for this type of event investing right now. Happy hunting (and, of course, feel free to<a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewRangeley"> DM me if you see any other interesting situations</a>!)</p><p><strong>PS- </strong>One bonus MGI thought while I&#8217;m here. The merger includes a go-shop. MGI had already run a process (according to Reuters). It&#8217;s strange but not unheard of for a company to run a process and then include a go shop. What is strange is that, in the event of a topping bid, the go-shop calls for different payments to be made to the parent (the current buyer) depending on who the new buyer / bidder is (s<a href="https://www.bamsec.com/filing/119312522042943/1?cik=1273931">ee the language from the merger agreement below</a>; <strong>emphasis mine)</strong>. I understand why they did that (the current buyer doesn&#8217;t want a bidder who just lost the process coming in over the top because they know the exact number to beat now), but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen this term before. I increased my position a bit after reading the agreement; on the whole it just seems like the initial process was run for financial buyers and they set up a go-shop that allows for the possibility a strategic comes over the top (<a href="https://twitter.com/compound248/status/1493944503740162051?s=11">compound has a quick list of a few strategics and why they might want MGI)</a>. Obviously I could be wrong, but it seems like a pretty interesting risk / reward with limited downside (heads you get a topping bid; tails you probably break even given I don&#8217;t think the deal falls apart inside of the go shop!) so I figured I&#8217;d give in to my spidey-senses. Still a small position though!</p><blockquote><p>The Merger Agreement also provides that, in certain circumstances, including the termination of the Merger Agreement by the Company to accept a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement), the termination of the Merger Agreement by Parent following a change in recommendation by the Company Board, and other customary circumstances, the Company would be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $32,800,000, except if the Merger Agreement is terminated by the Company to enter into a competing acquisition agreement during the Solicitation Period or within 20 days thereafter with a buyer solicited under the go-shop provisions in the Merger Agreement, in which case the Company would be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $16,400,000 <strong>(or $30,000,000 if such buyer was a certain type of prior bidder as specified in the Merger Agreement).</strong> The Merger Agreement also provides that, in certain circumstances involving termination of the Merger Agreement following a failure by Parent to consummate the Merger or a material breach by Parent or Merger Sub, or the failure to obtain required approvals with respect to money transmitter licenses (if such determination is final and non-appealable), Parent would be required to pay the Company a termination fee of $65,500,000, except if the Merger Agreement is terminated due to the failure of obtaining required approvals with respect to money transmitter licenses, in which case Parent would be required to pay the Company a termination fee of $30,000,000. Parent&#8217;s obligations to pay any reverse termination fee and certain other fees and expenses up to a cap are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantors.</p></blockquote><p><strong>PPS- </strong>This post would normally be a &#8220;weekend thoughts&#8221; post, but I&#8217;m on vacation for the long weekend and this is semi-timely given MGI just announced their bid, so I figured I&#8217;d get it out now.

Interestingly, I&#8217;d say the most frequent response was suggesting Intel (INTC) as a potential candidate. Of the ~50 people who responded, maybe 30 of them included Intel as a candidate for a big multi-year run. Why?</p><ul><li><p>Low starting multiple (INTC trades for maybe 12x P/E)</p></li><li><p>New rockstar CEO coming in after the last team probably mismanaged the business</p></li><li><p>Business / industry that definitely has market tailwinds (though we could argue if INTC is positioned to capture them!).</p></li></ul><p>Anyway, just wanted to note that the responses for INTC were interesting, but that&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m thinking about this weekend.</p><p>What I am thinking about is my friend David Kim (<a href="https://www.scuttleblurb.com">author of the always excellent Scuttleblurb</a>) responded to my piece and said, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;ve had similar thoughts about NVDA / MSFT a few years ago!&#8221; Indeed he has;<a href="https://www.scuttleblurb.com/nvda2/"> check out what he wrote up in his NVDA</a> piece last July</p><blockquote><p>There is a time and place for grandiose convictions. In 2005, pounding the table with: &#8220;Nvidia&#8217;s going to be the dominate stack for the biggest compute trends&#8221; would have been prescient but also, I submit to you, absurd and unjustified.&nbsp; But any thesis more specific than that would have mandated that you blow out of the stock.&nbsp; In 2007, the thesis that that Nvidia&#8217;s MCP business and Windows Vista would catalyze mainstream GPU adoption would have broke 2 years later.&nbsp; The same is true if in 2009, following a ~60%-70% decline in Nvidia&#8217;s stock over the previous 2 years, you believed mobile was the next gargantuan opportunity.&nbsp; In 2012, many analysts still thought Windows RT (Windows 8 for ARM) was going to be a the third major operating system alongside iOS and Android, and presented a vast growth opportunity for Tegra.&nbsp; No one at the time was really talking in earnest about megatrends like machine learning, big data, and &#8220;the metaverse&#8221; that would really come to make the difference.&nbsp;</p><p>The same could be said about Microsoft.&nbsp; Investors see where Microsoft is trading today and berate themselves for not buying in 2011 when the stock was trading at 12x earnings.&nbsp; But Microsoft is not only a different bet today than it was in 2011, but different in ways that were unknowable at the time.&nbsp; Central to most long pitches back then was that desktop Windows was a resilient cash gushing platform, that mobile wasn&#8217;t a real threat for such and such reasons or that Microsoft would carry its dominance of PCs into mobile or something.&nbsp; But MSFT has 10x&#8217;ed over the last decade for reasons (mostly) unrelated to desktop Windows and despite its failure in mobile.&nbsp; You can&#8217;t even latch onto the catch-all &#8220;culture&#8221; argument &#8211; i.e., &#8220;nobody knows what the future holds but this company has an adaptive culture and a great leadership team, so they will figure it out&#8221;.&nbsp; This was still the Ballmer era.&nbsp; No reasonable person looking at Microsoft should have cited &#8220;dynamic culture and management&#8221; as part of their pitch.&nbsp; Not even Microsoft knew what it was going to be at the time. We tend to focus on whether an investment decision turned out to be right or wrong rather than the degree of conviction justified by what was knowable at the time.</p><p>When researching a stock, I often mentally snap myself back to an earlier date and ask what a reasonable thesis could have been. But this is also a tricky exercise with no right answers</p></blockquote><p>I read that piece when it came out, but I didn&#8217;t remember that part of it till David reminded me. I didn&#8217;t plagiarize the idea or anything (nor do I think David was accusing me of that! We were having a friendly discussion!), but I can&#8217;t help but wonder if having read that months ago planted the seed for me to have the idea / write it up recently.</p><p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about that &#8220;planting&#8221; of an idea a lot lately: we&#8217;re not going to remember most of the stuff we read today in a few months, but the information and thought process we read now probably buries in the back of our mind like a little seed waiting to sprout and connect at the right time / when the right prompt comes up (or it &#8220;incepts&#8221; us, for those who have seen inception).</p><p>That&#8217;s really powerful stuff, and it&#8217;s got lots of implications. But I&#8217;ve been thinking about it in one specific way: macro predictions when it comes to investing.</p><p>It can be really fun to debate and read up on macro stuff. Everyone wants to talk Fed policy, where interest rates are going, if inflation is heading higher or lower, etc. I get it. It&#8217;s really easy to have an opinion and debate on it, it requires a heck of a lot less work than studying up on a new company or something, and you can have a macro / fed conversation with basically anyone so it crosses borders really easily (i.e. I can have a macro conversation with someone who specializes in VC, PE, microcaps, biotech, or even someone who doesn&#8217;t invest! That&#8217;s certainly not the case if you&#8217;re looking at a company that&#8217;s not a household name). And, if you get a macro call right, the returns can be much faster than waiting for a company&#8217;s stock price to compound from a series of good earnings or something.</p><p>But I also think it&#8217;s dangerous. If you&#8217;re a fundamental investor and you&#8217;re spending any meaningful amount of time reading and thinking about macro stuff, it&#8217;s going to incept you. And, the fact is, most macro stuff tends to be overwhelmingly bearish; it&#8217;s just much easier to spin a wall of worry and talk about how everything is going to hell. That stuff gets way more eyeballs and sounds way better than saying &#8220;yeah, the world is scary, but humanity tends to find a way and stocks go up over the long term.&#8221; And if you&#8217;re reading bearish macro stuff (or any macro stuff), it&#8217;s going to start impacting how you&#8217;re thinking about and looking at companies. </p><p>Maybe that&#8217;s a good thing! Avoiding banks that looked cheap heading into the financial crisis would have been great. And my personal biggest regret as an investor is how I loaded up on stuff that was sensitive to COVID heading into the pandemic; I just never thought the world could stop like that.</p><p>But, in general, the best investors I know tend to find companies that are mispriced / misunderstood by the market, and then just buy them and ignore the macro noise (or any noise in general). I suspect that if you&#8217;re straying from that path by reading macro stuff, it&#8217;s going to &#8220;incept&#8221; you and you&#8217;ll start missing the forest (dramatically undervalued stocks you find) for the trees (worries that the market is going to drop by 10% in the short term, so why not wait till then to buy the stock?).</p><p><strong>PS- </strong>one bonus though while I&#8217;m here. It&#8217;ll come as no surprise to any long time reader of the blog that I read a lot, and most of what I read is fantasy books (I have a m<a href="https://yetanothervalueblog.substack.com/p/some-things-and-ideas-january-2022">onthly recurring feature in my monthly links</a> article recommending fantasy books!). I&#8217;ve definitely been thinking about how getting &#8220;incepted&#8221; plays with all of the fantasy books I read, but I don&#8217;t have a firm view yet. Does it make me more creative? Does it make me more likely to live in a fantasy land outside of reality? I know lots of tech guys love sci-fi; does sci-fi incept them to think about the future in more fun and clever ways, or do they read sci-fi because they like to think about the future and sci-fi plays into that? IDK; very open to thoughts and suggestions here. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tegus sponsored deep dive #1: Cable (part 4: Starlink)]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is part 4 of my deep dive into cable threats (sponsored by Tegus).

Most Tegus calls are behind paywall, but for the next year, these links should give you access to the calls even without a Tegus sub, so it&#8217;s a great trial even if you&#8217;re not a sub! The three calls are:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://app.tegus.co/guest/view/qiwWPgsAjBciQDo1XSbzCkehCjHSZxumopaTh2egnFxQc5B82mWc54w45LQ8">Former Chairman of the FCC</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://app.tegus.co/guest/view/oKq4DtaCXn9fJ1QUdP8K1p6GCDfN4zLzSjbNYrXHExxggvoY7fLBzQVoNC33">Telecommunications Executive and Consultant</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://app.tegus.co/guest/view/8Y247zVsJbuTv1SNpoNEtquSWTRdCUZLi9ccDiVYtob6kmvJc9sXrnrtUbF9">Former Manager of Starlink Gateways at SpaceX</a></p></li></ul><p>That out the way, let&#8217;s dive into Starlink.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/starlink-satellite-internet-explained/">Starlink </a></strong><a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/starlink-satellite-internet-explained/">is the satellite broadband play</a> from Elon Musk&#8217;s SpaceX. The goal is to launch literally thousands of low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites and use them to power a global broadband network. Cable bears have been pointing to Starlink as a massive looming threat; the company won <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/tech/spacex-winning-rdof-funds-2021-could-be-year-satellite-broadband-lifts-off">almost $1B in the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF) auction t</a>o build out to underserved / rural locations in the U.S., and every few months an article like this one will talk about how<a href="https://www.thestar.com/business/2022/01/08/crazy-good-rural-canadians-are-raving-over-elon-musks-starlink-satellite-based-internet-service-should-canadas-big-telcos-be-worried.html"> revolutionary SpaceX&#8217;s service is for the early adopters</a>. Combine those plans / reviews with the seemingly negative cost of capital that anything Elon Musk touches seems to get, and SpaceX poses a worldwide risk to the broadband industry.</p><p>So Starlink is certainly worrying. However, when I step back, I think the threats are more &#8220;on the margins&#8221; than terminal. I&#8217;ve mentioned several times in this series that the fastest, most reliable, cheapest way to deliver broadband is always going to be have fixed infrastructure (like cable or fiber to the home) connecting to the consumer; nothing I&#8217;ve seen about Starlink (or Starry, the topic for the next post in this series) changes that belief and that&#8217;s why I think cable continues to win in the long run. In addition, I think there are serious long term issues with Starlink that will limit its market / reach in most developed markets. It&#8217;s not just me who thinks that; even Elon Mush has said<a href="https://www.lightreading.com/services/musks-starlink-is-not-some-huge-threat-to-telcos/d/d-id/758092"> Starlink is not some huge threat to telecos</a> (maybe I should have just skipped all the interviews and writing and ended the article there?).</p><p>As mentioned above, Starlink is aiming to use LEO satellites to blanket the globe and offer high speed internet around the world. High speed satellite internet is nothing new; <a href="https://www.viasat.com/home-internet/plans/">Viasat </a>and<a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/hughesnet-internet-review/"> HughesNet </a>have been offering satellite broadband internet for years. Heck, if you zoom out, competition for telecom players from satellite is nothing new; Dish and DirecTV were formidable competitors to cable television in the 90s and 00s.</p><p>So the threats from satellite internet are nothing new. However, Starlink represents a unique beast. Viasat and HughesNet offer undoubtedly inferior products; speeds are limited (for example, HughesNet seems to offer ~25 megs down / 3 megs up), and you&#8217;ll get capped if you use too much data. So, in almost all cases, if someone has the option of a &#8220;normal&#8221; broadband provider like cable or fiber, they&#8217;re going to go with that over satellite internet.</p><p>Starlink is different. Their base service is 100-200 mbps, and they just rolled out a <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/starlink-intros-faster-leo-satellite-broadband-tier-500-month?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=FT-NL-FierceWireless&amp;oly_enc_id=5123F8662390H8Z">premium service that&#8217;s 150-500 megs</a>. Those speeds are comparable to the base packages cable / fiber offer today, and Starlink is clearly planning to use those speeds to attack the broadband market. One of<a href="https://app.tegus.co/guest/view/8Y247zVsJbuTv1SNpoNEtquSWTRdCUZLi9ccDiVYtob6kmvJc9sXrnrtUbF9"> my expert calls was with a former Starlink manager</a>, and he was clear that he thought legacy telecom should be afraid:</p><blockquote><p>So, I think the theme, I guess, what I'm trying to message to you is SpaceX will attack its market incredibly quickly, and they're going to rapidly outpace anyone else in the satellite telecommunications game, and they're going to rapidly put the infrastructure on orbit that would compromise other traditional terrestrial service providers. So that's what SpaceX does. That's what Elon does. They move really quickly, and you should expect the same thing here.</p></blockquote><p>That&#8217;s a scary backdrop. If there&#8217;s one thing equity investors have learned over the past decade, it&#8217;s that you bet on legacy companies and against Elon at your own peril.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc819bb4-d48c-4c4c-8acc-c6518597a442_1125x635.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc819bb4-d48c-4c4c-8acc-c6518597a442_1125x635.png" width="1125" height="635" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cc819bb4-d48c-4c4c-8acc-c6518597a442_1125x635.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:635,&quot;width&quot;:1125,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:41939,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc819bb4-d48c-4c4c-8acc-c6518597a442_1125x635.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc819bb4-d48c-4c4c-8acc-c6518597a442_1125x635.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc819bb4-d48c-4c4c-8acc-c6518597a442_1125x635.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc819bb4-d48c-4c4c-8acc-c6518597a442_1125x635.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>So this is not a risk I take lightly&#8230; but I still think history and the physics suggest that even Starlink / SpaceX are going to run into a wall when it comes to taking on domestic broadband. No doubt there&#8217;s a place for it; Starlink is going to be a godsend for connecting a lot of very rural locations. But I struggle to see how Starlink makes a real dent into the core broadband business.</p><p>Why? </p><p>First, I&#8217;d note that history suggests LEO businesses tend not to work. Again, Starlink seems to further along than many of their predecessors, but <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/aerospace-and-defense/our-insights/large-leo-satellite-constellations-will-it-be-different-this-time">history is littered with satellite internet businesses</a> that were going to take over the world and went bankrupt. </p><p>Second, I have lots of questions on Starlink&#8217;s speed and how it holds up as more people hop on the network. Again, for rural people this won&#8217;t be a problem, but I suspect Starlink&#8217;s speeds are really good because there aren&#8217;t a lot of people on the network currently. If you ever got multiple people in the same region on the network, speeds would likely suffer. <a href="https://app.tegus.co/guest/view/qiwWPgsAjBciQDo1XSbzCkehCjHSZxumopaTh2egnFxQc5B82mWc54w45LQ8">The experts seemed to agree with that</a>,</p><blockquote><p>The problem with Starlink right now is, you've seen the articles about how difficult it has been and how temperamental it has been. I mean that's growing pains, but the reality is that 100 meg or the speeds that they can offer today they can offer because there's a little contention on the network. Congratulations, you have been successful and your speeds go down as a result.</p></blockquote><p>And remember- I mentioned in<a href="https://yetanothervalueblog.substack.com/p/tegus-sponsored-deep-dive-1-cable-b64"> part 3 (on fixed wireless) </a>how the demand for broadband is constantly growing. Right now, you might look at Starlink&#8217;s 100 megs and say &#8220;that&#8217;s a reasonable amount of speed.&#8221; But roll forward five years and there&#8217;s a good chance that speed level isn&#8217;t going to be close to enough to support all of the different data demands a household has (9k video, VR games, etc.). Cable and fiber can offer 1 gig today, and they have a much cleaner path to upgrading that speed over time. I think it comes <a href="https://app.tegus.co/guest/view/qiwWPgsAjBciQDo1XSbzCkehCjHSZxumopaTh2egnFxQc5B82mWc54w45LQ8">back to this quote,</a> </p><blockquote><p>Here's what we know. We know that demand is going up. and is going to continue to go up. We know that the fiber capacity increases essentially in parallel with Moore's Law. And we know that there is no other delivery mechanism that can say that. End of discussion.</p></blockquote><p>There&#8217;s also questions on the reliability of the service. Have you ever had a broadband outage? I live in a giant apartment building, and like once a month my cable will go offline for maybe two minutes. Why? I have no idea, but I know when it happens because my Bloomberg immediately disconnects, whatever I&#8217;m streaming stops, all my smart devices go bonkers, etc. It&#8217;s insanely frustrating, so much so that I can remember specific instances of when it happened. Now, imagine that frustration, except apply it to every time there&#8217;s a storm or the wind pushes some trees the wrong way so they interfere with your house&#8217;s line of sight to the satellites. That&#8217;<a href="https://app.tegus.co/guest/view/qiwWPgsAjBciQDo1XSbzCkehCjHSZxumopaTh2egnFxQc5B82mWc54w45LQ8">s what can happen with satellite,</a></p><blockquote><p>Above the tree line, Starlink may be a great decision, and congratulations, 100 meg is all you can do.</p><p>And for what you're going to be doing above the tree line, that's great. For the curves and where things are going, it isn't going to work. I mean, you're not going to be doing the Metaverse above the tree line. I'm sorry</p></blockquote><p>Even putting all of those concerns aside, regulations and physics are going to serve as a big moat for legacy broadband players in suburban and urban markets. The former Starlink manager noted that regulations meant their network could only service 300-600 users in a city sized area.</p><blockquote><p>And it turns out, with the current satellite design, roughly approximating here, for an area the size of like Seattle or Toronto, that large of a surface area, you can really only put like 300 to 600 users. So, this isn't, as you've said, honestly, that big of a competitive threat to like raw servicing of highly dense areas, it's a spatial play.</p></blockquote><p>The Starlink manager framed that as a big part of the Starlink appeal; they could attack a couple of customers in every region across the globe</p><blockquote><p>And it turns out, with the current satellite design, roughly approximating here, for an area the size of like Seattle or Toronto, that large of a surface area, you can really only put like 300 to 600 users. So, this isn't, as you've said, honestly, that big of a competitive threat to like raw servicing of highly dense areas, it's a spatial play.</p><p>So, in a lot of ways, a big competitive advantage that SpaceX has is, they're attacking every customer, every competitor a little bit, because as you know, the telecom broadband fixed cable community is highly nonhomogenous, heterogeneous or whatever the word would be.</p><p>It's very diversified and there's a lot of different owners that all own their fight to them. Well, SpaceX is attacking those guys just a little bit everywhere. So, we're talking a lot of different people, but nobody directly that's going to cause them to have a lot of competitive backlash.</p></blockquote><p>I have my doubts. I&#8217;m with them that a lot of telecom is a game of scale and leveraging your fixed costs, but I struggle to understand how it&#8217;s a good thing that Starlink can only attack a couple of hundred consumers in a market with millions of households. If you think back to the FTTH overview in part 2, it takes years for a new network to scale up because taking customers from their existing service is a literal battle that often involves lots of marketing, going door to door with sales, and capturing people when they&#8217;re most likely to switch (i.e. when they move). Obviously Elon carries a marketing touch that no other company has (Tesla doesn&#8217;t advertise and instead relies on word of mouth and Elon&#8217;s Twitter), but that game gets a lot more difficult when you&#8217;re trying to get people to switch a service that is basically a utility to them. How is Starlink going to capture people when they&#8217;re most apt to churn? And how is Starlink going to turn people down when their local networks start getting too crowded?</p><p>And this isn&#8217;t just a short term issue; the Starlink manager suggested that they&#8217;d be able to service some extra people in an area over time, but they&#8217;ll still always have a big cap on how many households they can service in a particular region:</p><blockquote><p>Yes, I think five years from now, totally guessing when I'm speaking, three years from now, five years from now, you're getting to the point where you have enough satellites in orbit and there's a newer generation with the larger aperture diameters antennas where you can fit, call it, 3,000 to 6,000 people in the same service territory where you only used to be able to fit 300 to 600.</p></blockquote><p>Anyway, put it all together and it&#8217;s hard for me to look at Starlink as a serious competitor to cable / fiber in the majority of the United States. It&#8217;ll be great in rural areas that are currently underserved and Starlink can easily reach them, but I suspect Starlink will make almost no inroads in urban and suburban markets and that the vast majority of people who have access to both a traditional fiber / cable internet provider and have starlink as an option will chose to go with the traditional option because it&#8217;s faster and more reliable.</p><p>By the way, it&#8217;s not just me and the general consensus of the experts I talked to who believe that. <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/musk-says-starlink-satellite-broadband-complements-fiber-5g">Elon Musk suggested over the summer that Starlink</a> is &#8220;a nice complement to fiber and 5G,&#8221; and he&#8217;s also<a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1446156822692315138"> tweeted Starlink is designed for</a> &#8220;low to medium population density.&#8221; Elon isn&#8217;t exactly known for being conservative with his projections, so for him to say it&#8217;ll be a complement and won&#8217;t completely eat their lunch suggests to me he knows the physics overwhelm Starlink in urban / suburban markets.</p><p>A few last Starlink things</p><ul><li><p>Right as I was finishing this article, I saw <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/4g3gwifi/starlinks-network-faces-significant-limitations-analysts-find/d/d-id/764159">this summary of a Cowen report</a>. I haven&#8217;t seen the actual report (which makes linking to dangerous), but it&#8217;s a great summary and very supportive of everything in here (plus with some references to reports and primary sources I haven&#8217;t seen / linked here).</p></li><li><p>I quoted from it extensively throughout the article, but I can&#8217;t recommend the <a href="https://app.tegus.co/guest/view/8Y247zVsJbuTv1SNpoNEtquSWTRdCUZLi9ccDiVYtob6kmvJc9sXrnrtUbF9">Starlink Expert interview enough f</a>or thinking through all the different parts of Starlink.</p></li><li><p>Just this month, Starlink <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/starlink-intros-faster-leo-satellite-broadband-tier-500-month?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=FT-NL-FierceWireless&amp;oly_enc_id=5123F8662390H8Z">introduced a premium tier that offers 150-500 mbps</a>. It&#8217;s $500/month, plus a $2.5k hardware fee. When you look at those costs, I think you can see the issues Starlink is going to have. Those speed ranges are in line with Charter&#8217;s base plans of 200 mbps, which costs $50 - $75/months (depending how you factor the promo rates in), has no data costs, and I believe has no installation or hardware fees. Starlink is just dominated by good cable / fiber.</p></li><li><p>The base <a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/musk-says-starlink-satellite-broadband-complements-fiber-5g">Starlink package has a terminal that costs &gt;$1k;</a> Starlink charges consumers ~$500 for that terminal, so they lose money on it. Those costs will come down over time, but it&#8217;s another expense / area that Starlink will struggle with if they actually try to take on cable.</p></li><li><p>Musk sent an email out late last year noting <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/elon-musk-to-spacex-starships-raptor-engine-crisis-risks-bankruptcy.html">SpaceX was at risk of bankruptcy</a>. I think that&#8217;s hyperbole; I near guarantee there would be 100 private equity and sovereign funds lining up to write SpaceX 10 figure checks if they ever asked (again, it sometimes seems Elon has a negative cost of capital). But the history of satellite and space internet companies is they go bankrupt, so I do think there is some base rate that suggests a BK is possible!</p></li><li><p>Starlink won almost<a href="https://www.fiercetelecom.com/telecom/ntca-fiber-broadband-association-diss-spacex-s-starlink-s-rdof-prospects"> $1B in subsidies from the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund in late 2020.</a> That<a href="https://www.telecompetitor.com/viasat-to-fcc-dont-approve-spacex-for-any-rdof-funding/"> grant has proven very controversial.</a> I can&#8217;t claim to be an expert so I&#8217;ll refrain from taking a view, but most of the people I&#8217;ve talked to who are knowledgeable seem to agree that there are real issues with the SpaceX bid, but I do think reading through <a href="https://www.fiercetelecom.com/telecom/ntca-fiber-broadband-association-diss-spacex-s-starlink-s-rdof-prospects">some of the push back </a>competitors are giving the SpaceX bid can help show some of the areas SpaceX is going to struggle with as they try to scale.</p></li></ul><p>Ok, that&#8217;s it for part 4. I&#8217;m going to return next week to wrap this series up by talking about Starry and some closing thoughts on the cable industry. Why next week? Well, Altice reports earnings next week, so I might grab a few quotes from their call / comment on their earnings a little bit. And, while this series has been a blast, it&#8217;s taken up a ton of time, so finishing it off next week lets me focus on a few other things in the meantime.</p><p>See y&#8217;all then!</p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
