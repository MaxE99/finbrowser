Both problems remain under-explored because advances in artificial intelligence algorithms have compensated for a relative lack of advances in AI hardware.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Background</h3><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has a hardware problem. Most of the conversation about AI&#8217;s hardware problem focuses on technical obstacles and solutions. However, the AI hardware problem is also market driven: the global semiconductor industry, which creates the hardware on which all AI operates, faces cyclical and structural challenges that pose potential roadblocks to ongoing innovation by AI designers and users.</p><p>In March 2021, the congressionally mandated National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI) released a 756-page <a href="https://www.nscai.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Full-Report-Digital-1.pdf">report </a>on the state of U.S. AI competitiveness. Among its many findings, the report observed that U.S. leadership in microelectronics is critical to overall U.S. leadership in AI. However, the report went on to note that, &#8220;despite tremendous expertise in microelectronics research, development, and innovation across the country, the United States is constrained by a lack of domestically located semiconductor fabrication facilities, especially for state-of-the-art semiconductors.&#8221;</p><p>It is precisely these semiconductors that power today&#8217;s most advanced AI systems. Sustained U.S. leadership in AI is contingent on sustained U.S. firm leadership in semiconductors. However, U.S. leadership in semiconductors has faltered in recent years at exactly the same time that interest in AI has peaked yet again. This divergence has important strategic implications for the United States and important implications for the AI innovation environment more generally. The limited number of advanced semiconductor manufacturers shapes the evolution of AI chips and thus the depth, breadth, and pace of innovation of AI.</p><h3>What Are AI Chips and How do Semiconductors Enable AI</h3><p>AI, the science of making computer systems intelligent, relies on a combination of algorithms, hardware, data, and talent. AI algorithms are the computational techniques and theorems developed by researchers to create predictive models. AI hardware, or &#8220;compute,&#8221; refers to commercial off-the-shelf or custom integrated circuits on which AI algorithms function. The term &#8220;data&#8221; refers to digital information, structured or unstructured, on which AI algorithms can be trained to ultimately make predictive inferences. Finally, talent refers to the highly skilled human know-how that synthesizes the hardware, software, and data into an AI system that creates value.</p><p>The development of these four components of AI has occurred at different stages since the 1980s. The enthusiasm AI has generated in the past decade is largely attributable to a favorable confluence of breakthroughs in AI hardware and data. However, chokepoints in the AI hardware supply chain and the semiconductor innovation ecosystem threaten to stymie current advances in AI. In particular, the fragility of the semiconductor supply chain, the concentration of advanced manufacturing resources in Taiwan, the sole-source reliance of most AI systems on chips from these Taiwanese manufacturers, and the slowing of Moore&#8217;s law all indicate hardware is the most likely determinant of AI competitiveness to undermine current breakthroughs.</p><p>AI hardware refers to certain semiconductors or &#8220;chips&#8221; that power all information technologies. While AI algorithms can run on any microprocessor, most models benefit from the speed and efficiency that comes with using specialized chips. There are three types of chips commonly used for AI workloads: GPUs, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). The use of all three types of chips comes with benefits and tradeoffs among speed, efficiency, accuracy, and flexibility (Table 1).</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17a8eecc-ebff-462e-b236-e66166e15275_499x185.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17a8eecc-ebff-462e-b236-e66166e15275_499x185.png" width="499" height="185" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/17a8eecc-ebff-462e-b236-e66166e15275_499x185.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:185,&quot;width&quot;:499,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:17401,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17a8eecc-ebff-462e-b236-e66166e15275_499x185.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17a8eecc-ebff-462e-b236-e66166e15275_499x185.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17a8eecc-ebff-462e-b236-e66166e15275_499x185.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17a8eecc-ebff-462e-b236-e66166e15275_499x185.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs are all optimized to handle different AI workloads. GPUs were originally designed for image-processing applications and found widespread commercial adoption in gaming systems before their more recent pivot to use in AI training tasks. GPUs efficiently and accurately process parallel computations, making them ideal for AI training in which an algorithm is iteratively &#8220;taught&#8221; using labeled data. FPGAs were invented in the 1980s and offer greater flexibility than other types of chips, allowing for post-fabrication customization depending on their AI workload. FPGAs can handle AI inference tasks, where efficiency and customization are more important. ASICs are specially designed chips optimized to perform specific algorithms powerfully and efficiently. ASICs can handle AI training or inference workloads depending on designer choices, but because their circuitry is customized for specific algorithms, they inherently lose relevance as AI algorithms evolve.</p><p>Companies engaged in AI research seek competitive advantages through better hardware. Semiconductor firms, which generally do not lead in AI research, compete to maximize the performance of their hardware. These competitive pressures have generally benefited recent advances in AI. Semiconductor manufacturers increase the computational power of their chips by adding more transistors on progressively smaller pieces of silicon. AI companies leverage advances in chip performance and cost by designing chips that optimize hardware performance to efficiently execute specific calculations associated with ML. This combination of specific design choices and advanced hardware is essential for leading AI firms because training a leading AI algorithm can require <a href="https://senrigan.io/blog/">months of computing time</a> and <a href="https://lambdalabs.com/blog/demystifying-gpt-3/">cost</a> tens of millions of U.S. dollars. The high fixed costs of semiconductor fabrication mean AI firms have focused their research and development efforts on algorithms, data, and talent. As a result, no leading firms engaged in AI research manufacture their own hardware, choosing instead to design and outsource the fabrication of hardware to contract semiconductor manufacturers. These specialized &#8220;AI chips&#8221; are essential for cost-effectively implementing AI at scale. Attempts to deliver comparable AI application using older AI chips or general-purpose chips can cost tens to thousands of times <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/ai-chips-what-they-are-and-why-they-matter/">more</a>. As a result, AI firms are keen to secure access to the most advanced compute. However, after innovating at a relatively predictable pace for 65+ years, the end of Dennard scaling has coincided with a loss of U.S. semiconductor manufacturing leadership, presenting strategic and innovative risks to AI.</p><h3>US Firm Leadership in AI Hardware</h3><p>There are no U.S. semiconductor firms that lead in AI and no U.S. AI firms that lead in semiconductors. As a result, AI firms, large and small, all compete to secure access to state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing and leverage hardware advantages for their AI efforts. However, as the number of leading-edge manufacturers has shrunk, this has meant these leading AI firms are all competing to secure capacity at one of the ever-diminishing number of leading edge manufacturers. Many of the most celebrated AI chips in the United States like Google&#8217;s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), Cerebras&#8217;s Wafer Scale Engine (WSE), and Nvidia&#8217;s A100 processor all share one thing in common: they are manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC). While U.S. firms continue to lead the world in designing custom silicon to handle AI workloads, the acute lack of advanced domestic manufacturing assets poses a supply chain risk that is under-analyzed by the AI community in the United States.</p><p>The loss of U.S. leadership in semiconductor manufacturing and its associated impact on AI chip development is perhaps most apparent when looking at Intel&#8217;s efforts to develop AI chips. After completing the US $2 billion <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-ai-acquisition/">acquisition</a> of AI chipmaker Habana Labs in 2019, Intel suffered a series of process slips that delayed commercial rollout of its 10- and 7-nm chip manufacturing processes by several years. At the same time, TSMC and Samsung both ramped up commercial production of 7-nm chips. Though Intel operates a series of 15 wafer fabs in 10 countries, Habana Labs was forced to partner with TSMC to take advantage of the most advanced manufacturing process available to ensure its AI chips would remain competitive. This is a remarkable admission by the U.S.&#8217;s once-leading semiconductor manufacturer that it can no longer meet the fabrication needs of companies it acquires. However, this decision to turn to TSMC is commonplace among leading U.S. AI companies. Table 2 presents the leading AI hardware developed by U.S. firms organized by the manufacturer they turn to for their AI hardware fabrication.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50e552d0-c582-4464-9654-d55989248b37_494x527.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50e552d0-c582-4464-9654-d55989248b37_494x527.png" width="494" height="527" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/50e552d0-c582-4464-9654-d55989248b37_494x527.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:527,&quot;width&quot;:494,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:63013,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50e552d0-c582-4464-9654-d55989248b37_494x527.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50e552d0-c582-4464-9654-d55989248b37_494x527.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50e552d0-c582-4464-9654-d55989248b37_494x527.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50e552d0-c582-4464-9654-d55989248b37_494x527.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>This reliance on Taiwan for AI hardware fabrication is also true of the chip industry more generally. A <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/100-day-supply-chain-review-report.pdf">recent</a> semiconductor supply chain risks review conducted by the White House concluded, &#8220;The United States relies primarily on Taiwan for leading edge logic chips and relies on Taiwan, South Korea, and China to meet demand for mature node chips.&#8221; This review identified fragile supply chains, malicious supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical factors as several risks associated with this geographic concentration of leading-edge fabrication resources. These findings echo those of the NSCAI.</p><h3>How Access to Advanced Manufacturing Bottlenecks AI Hardware Innovation</h3><p>In addition to presenting a strategic risk to U.S. AI firms, the concentration of advanced semiconductor manufacturing in Asia also constrains innovation in the AI start-up world, shaping the depth, breadth, and pace of innovation in the AI field. Data on AI hardware start-ups indicate there are roughly 225 firms engaged in the design of AI accelerators. These 225 firms have raised approximately US$20.8 billion, though the 10 largest AI hardware startups account for US$12.7 billion (61%) of that total, and several of them have been acquired or are publicly held. Most AI hardware start-ups are headquartered in the United States (~85) and China (~75), followed by the United Kingdom (10), France (9), and Israel (8). AI hardware start-ups are a negligible part of the rest of the AI/ML start-up ecosystem however. Start-up investment data indicate AI hardware start-ups accounted for only 3% of all AI and ML venture capital deals from 2017 to 2021. Because of the high cost of getting their designs fabricated, U.S. AI hardware start-ups are unappealing to private investors. In fact, DARPA <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/attachments/AISS_ProposersDay_LeefSlides.pdf">observed</a> that from 2012&#8211; 2017 there was &#8220;virtually no early stage venture capital funding for U.S. chip start-ups [AI or otherwise] due to the perceived cost of first working silicon exceeding US$20 million.&#8221;</p><p>While this ecosystem contains a wide variety of firms engaged in ASIC-, GPU-, and FPGA-specific designs for AI optimization, this diversity is not reflected in the manufacturers on whom these start-ups rely. AI hardware startups disproportionately favor turning to TSMC for their manufacturing services, and the fact that these hardware start-ups secure manufacturing services correlates strongly with increased funding rounds down the road. TSMC is the leader in AI hardware manufacturing at advanced nodes. Table 3 presents a list of 23 AI start-ups that are developing hardware solutions as compiled by <a href="https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Credit-Suisse_Randy-Abrams_Examining-Chinas-Semi-Self-Sufficiency.pdf">analysts at Credit Suisse</a>. Of these 23 start-ups, seven have an unknown manufacturing roadmap (the foundry and/or the node at which they propose to manufacture are unknown). However, of the remaining 16 AI hardware start-ups, TSMC provides manufacturing services to 11 of them. GlobalFoundries is the only other contract manufacturer that counts more than one AI hardware start-up as a customer, coming in well behind TSMC with three start-ups turning to them for manufacturing services. The 11 start-ups that use TSMC have collectively raised US$4.065 billion, while the three startups using GlobalFoundries have raised US$500 million.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fedb57940-e03c-4606-beea-79386457493b_754x871.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fedb57940-e03c-4606-beea-79386457493b_754x871.png" width="754" height="871" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/edb57940-e03c-4606-beea-79386457493b_754x871.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:871,&quot;width&quot;:754,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:159686,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fedb57940-e03c-4606-beea-79386457493b_754x871.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fedb57940-e03c-4606-beea-79386457493b_754x871.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fedb57940-e03c-4606-beea-79386457493b_754x871.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fedb57940-e03c-4606-beea-79386457493b_754x871.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>In effect, TSMC serves as a &#8220;kingmaker&#8221; in the AI hardware start-up world: the &#8220;best&#8221; manufacture with TSMC, the &#8220;rest&#8221; settle for other manufacturers. However, TSMC charges high rates and serves purely as a contract manufacturer, taking business only from those start-ups who are able to afford to pay for their services. They compete for TSMC&#8217;s capacity with the likes of Nvidia and AMD, along with Apple&#8217;s consumer electronics business. TSMC does not accept business based on the technical merits of the AI start-up itself, meaning that presumably some of the most innovative AI start-ups today are not getting access to the best manufacturing because they cannot compete on price. Interestingly, many AI start-ups that choose to manufacture with TSMC do so at more mature nodes: only four of the 11 start-ups had access to TSMC&#8217;s then-leading-edge 7-nm process, while the remainder manufactured at 16 and 28 nm, nodes for which there is substantial other manufacturing capacity from the likes of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) (China), United Microelectronics Corporation (Taiwan), and GlobalFoundries (United States). This suggests that AI start-ups prefer to manufacture with TSMC for reasons that extend beyond purely technical merit and indicate that reputational affiliation with TSMC is seen as prohibitively favorable. While there have been <a href="https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-compute/">some</a> recent AI breakthroughs that have not relied on particularly powerful computing architectures, AI companies generally remain (understandably) myopic in their pursuit of maximizing compute.</p><h3>How AI Algorithmic Advances Compensate for AI Hardware</h3><p>Advances in AI algorithms have compensated for a relative lack of advances in AI compute and the increasing consolidation of firms capable of making the most advanced AI hardware. Researchers have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41928-018-0068-2">stated</a> that &#8220;the recent success of deep neural networks has been driven by advances in algorithms and network architectures, but also, notably, through the growing availability of vast amounts of data and the continuing development of ever more powerful computers.&#8221; However, the development of more powerful compute has lagged the other key components of AI. Recently, researchers at OpenAI <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04305">observed</a> that advances in AI algorithmic efficiency have improved performance such that it now &#8220;takes 44 times less compute to train a neural network to the level of AlexNet18 (by contrast, Moore&#8217;s Law would yield an 11x cost improvement over this period).&#8221;</p><p>AI&#8217;s hardware problems have been remarked-upon before. However, these observations have focused primarily on the technical aspects of hardware challenges. For example, in April 2018, the journal Nature <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41928-018-0068-2">observed</a> that &#8220;the performance of the typical hardware platforms&#8212;graphics processing units (GPUs), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs)&#8212;cannot keep pace with the increasing size of leading deep neural network designs.&#8221; The divergence in the level of progress between AI algorithms and AI hardware is striking considering that hardware is increasingly intensively consumed by AI tasks, making it all the more important. <a href="https://aiindex.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-AI-Index-Report_Master.pdf">Stanford&#8217;s 2021 AI Index Report</a> observed &#8220;the training time on ImageNet] has fallen from 6.2 min (December 2018) to 47 s (July 2020). At the same time, the amount of hardware used to achieve these results has increased dramatically&#8221; with the number of AI accelerators used to accomplish the task growing from 640 to 4,096.20 This observation echoes that of an OpenAI analysis from 2018 which found &#8220;amount of compute used in the largest AI training runs has been increasing exponentially with a 3.4- month doubling time (by comparison, Moore&#8217;s Law had a 2-year doubling period).&#8221;</p><p>This juxtaposition&#8212;that AI hardware is increasingly important, but its production is increasingly consolidated&#8212; presents a risk to overall advances in AI. Several technical solutions have been <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41928-018-0054-8">proposed</a> to address hardware bottlenecks that aim to more tightly couple memory and processing (either via nanoscale resistive memory devices or by combining in-memory processing with digital processing). However, these solutions address technical challenges with AI hardware. The deeper problem remains that all new or novel solutions to AI&#8217;s technical hardware problems run through a small number of companies capable of producing these chips.</p><div><hr></div><p><em>The views expressed here are my own and not those of employers past or present.</em></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[No Permits, No Fabs]]></title><description><![CDATA[How to Make it Easier to Build Semiconductor Factories]]></description><link>https://semiliterate.substack.com/p/no-permits-no-fabs</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://semiliterate.substack.com/p/no-permits-no-fabs</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Semi-Literate]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 18:45:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd6f54f9-f5dc-4827-a7f7-ac70eab9f6e8.jp2" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Welcome to Semi-Literate, a guide to the chip industry through the lens of public policy.</em></p><div><hr></div><p><em><strong>BLUF</strong></em>: The United States currently builds fewer fabs at a slower rate than the rest of the world. This post summarizes infrastructure investments and regulatory reforms that could make the United States a more attractive place to build new chipmaking capacity.

The simple reality is that there are very few leading-edge semiconductor manufacturers in the world, and most of them are headquartered outside the United States. In practice, this means that the United States must craft policies that convince specific foreign companies to build outside of their headquarters country, where presumably they face significant political pressure to build domestically and enjoy easier access to policymakers to facilitate build-out in regulatory environments they can navigate adeptly.</p><h3>The U.S. Builds Fewer Fabs More Slowly Than the Rest of the World</h3><p>It takes a long time (typically two to four years) to build a fab in any country. But fab construction takes much longer in the United States than in the East Asian countries where most chipmaking currently takes place. There are many factors underlying the decline in U.S. chipmaking capacity, but one under-appreciated factor may be the longer construction timelines associated with building new (&#8220;greenfield&#8221;) American fabs. Companies who want to build new fabs fast generally build in Asia.</p><p>In part because of the unique infrastructure requirements of fabs and the regulatory processes these large construction projects must navigate, construction of semiconductor fabs takes several years. Between 1990 and 2020 there were approximately 635 greenfield semiconductor fabs built around the world. The average time between the construction start date and the beginning date of production was 682 days or roughly 1.86 years. This timeline does not include pre-permitting and pre-construction considerations, indicating that fab construction times exceed two years on average.</p><h4>Average Time it takes to Build a New Fab, by Region, 1990-2020</h4><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb83ed5e-2ad8-45cb-bafd-570c2a3c8877_485x257.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb83ed5e-2ad8-45cb-bafd-570c2a3c8877_485x257.png" width="485" height="257" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/eb83ed5e-2ad8-45cb-bafd-570c2a3c8877_485x257.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:257,&quot;width&quot;:485,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:17913,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb83ed5e-2ad8-45cb-bafd-570c2a3c8877_485x257.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb83ed5e-2ad8-45cb-bafd-570c2a3c8877_485x257.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb83ed5e-2ad8-45cb-bafd-570c2a3c8877_485x257.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb83ed5e-2ad8-45cb-bafd-570c2a3c8877_485x257.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>There is considerable regional variation in the time it takes to build a new fab. Japan (584 days) and South Korea (620 days) build fabs significantly faster than the rest of the world on average. The Americas, of which the United States is the primary site of semiconductor fabrication facilities, build fabs at a significantly reduced speed, taking an average of 736 days, or roughly five months longer than Japan. For context, in a period of five months, leading edge foundries like those operated by Samsung and TSMC could produce roughly 500,000 wafers.</p><p>From 1990-2020, the time required to build a new fab in the United States increased 38 percent, rising from an average of 665 days (1.8 years) during the 1990 to 2000 time period to 918 days (2.5 years) during the 2010-2020 time period.

As a result, construction must carefully navigate arcane regulatory processes to develop greenfield semiconductor fabs. Recognizing the time delays that these regulations and permitting processes place on semiconductor manufacturers, other countries provide incentives and indirect subsidies to expedite fab construction timelines. Below are a few  country-specific snapshots:</p><h4>Taiwan:</h4><p>The Taiwanese government&#8217;s Ministry of Economic Affairs offers tax and tariff incentives as well as research and development (R&amp;D) subsidies to attract semiconductor companies. Specifically, Taiwan maintains a business tax rate of 17 percent, allows semiconductor firms to credit up to 15 percent of their research &amp; development expenses against their income tax bill annually, and permits firms to import semiconductor manufacturing equipment tariff-free. Subsidies are also available for up to 50 percent of total spending by semiconductor firms who establish an R&amp;D center in Taiwan. International semiconductor firms are clearly responsive to these incentives. The Taiwanese government notes these incentives have successfully attracted Micron, the U.S. memory chip company, to build a fab in Taiwan, while equipment suppliers like ASML from the Netherlands, as well as Applied Materials and Lam Research from the United States, have all set up R&amp;D centers or training headquarters in Taiwan. Taiwan&#8217;s investment authority has also helped U.S. chipmakers building fabs in-country &#8220;in terms of land acquisition&#8230;accelerated the administrative process&#8230;eliminated investment barriers (such as coordinating underground pipelines and sidewalk construction) [and] organized job fairs to help the company recruit talent.&#8221;</p><h4>China:</h4><p>China&#8217;s industrial plans for the semiconductor industry are <a href="https://semiliterate.substack.com/p/made-in-china-2025-and-semiconductors">well-understood</a>, and its incentives/subsidies are clearly aimed to facilitate fab construction. Some interesting incentives that are less-visible include the provision of water and electricity to semiconductor firms at below-market rates via state utilities. Similarly, the provision of land at below-market prices to semiconductor manufacturers was observed by the OECD to be a form of investment incentive. The OECD highlighted the case of Tsinghua Unigroup, a Chinese semiconductor firm which &#8220;purchased land for its foundry in Chengdu for CNY 240 per m^2, while the official average price for industrial land in second-tier cities was CNY 724 per m^2.&#8221;</p><h4>Singapore:</h4><p>Through government agencies like the Economic Development Board and JTC Corporation, Singapore has established four industrial estates that provide shovel-ready plots of land for semiconductor manufacturers and their suppliers that come pre-equipped with basic infrastructure like power, electricity and roads. These estates also include ready-built facilities that feature chilled water, bulk industrial gas supply, high ceilings to accommodate SME, and incorporate vibration-control construction techniques. The results of the Singaporean government&#8217;s efforts are clear, having successfully attracted 14 global semiconductor firms employing 18,600 workers in the industry across these estates.</p><h3>U.S. Regulations that Impact Fab Construction</h3><p>At the federal level, there are many laws designed to maintain environmental quality that are also known to often significantly delay major construction projects. Notably, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review process governs construction projects deemed to be a &#8220;major federal action.&#8221; If the provision of CHIPS Act incentives are determined to be a &#8220;major federal action&#8221; then the construction of new semiconductor fabs could be significantly delayed. In 2020 the White House Council on Environmental Quality compiled data on timelines for 1,276 Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) filed between 2010 and 2018 and found that NEPA reviews averaged 4.5 years. This permitting process does not include the average of 1.86 years it takes to physically construct a semiconductor fab. This number also does not reflect other federal environmental reviews, some of which may happen concurrent with the NEPA process or entirely separately.</p><p>A 2017 report from the White House also identified pre-construction permits and operating permits required under the Clean Air Act as &#8220;the primary barrier to responsible and timely facility permitting&#8221; finding that &#8220;for some large projects, [this] permitting process can take 12&#8211;18 months.&#8221; More recently, the EPA has announced a goal to make permitting decisions within six months of receipt. But as discussed earlier, given the tight timelines on which this industry operates, any delay can be costly to a firm&#8217;s competitiveness.</p><h3>Recent Legislation To Solve This Problem</h3><p>Sens. Hagerty, King and Portman recently introduced an <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000017d-6d13-d3d7-a37d-ef9f82d70000">amendment</a> to the NDAA that would ease the regulatory burden for technology construction projects. The amendment would add <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000017d-6d13-d3d7-a37d-ef9f82d70000">key technologies</a> &#8212; like semiconductors or electric vehicle batteries &#8212; to the <a href="https://www.permits.performance.gov/about/title-41-fixing-americas-surface-transportation-act-fast-41">FAST-41</a> federal permitting program. The FAST-41 program has been in operation for several years and aims to increase coordination between permitting agencies while also maintaining the health, safety, or environmental protection intent behind may of these regulations. </p><p>However, it does not look like this amendment made it in to the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1605/text">recently-signed 2022 NDAA</a>.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The U.S. has a substantial deficit in semiconductor manufacturing. From 1990 to 2020, China built 32 fabs that produce 100,000 or more wafer starts per month (WSpM), while the rest of the world only built 24 during the same time period. <em>The United States had no greenfield fab projects that involved construction of factories with capacity greater than or equal to 100,000 WSpM during this 30-year time period.</em></p><h4>Number of 100,000 WSpM Fab Projects By Region (L) and Average Construction Time (R), 1990-2020</h4><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3f11dd1-ceb2-4594-aea2-89894b409101_599x232.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3f11dd1-ceb2-4594-aea2-89894b409101_599x232.png" width="599" height="232" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b3f11dd1-ceb2-4594-aea2-89894b409101_599x232.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:232,&quot;width&quot;:599,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:25432,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3f11dd1-ceb2-4594-aea2-89894b409101_599x232.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3f11dd1-ceb2-4594-aea2-89894b409101_599x232.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3f11dd1-ceb2-4594-aea2-89894b409101_599x232.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3f11dd1-ceb2-4594-aea2-89894b409101_599x232.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The CHIPS Act aims to solve this problem.

Its worth stating the obvious here: <em>each of these companies derives ~half their revenue from sales to China</em>.</p><h5>U.S. Chip Firm Percent of Net Revenue Derived from China, 2016-20</h5><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71f79e19-83b0-4b00-9103-c726165e1cc8_898x579.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71f79e19-83b0-4b00-9103-c726165e1cc8_898x579.png" width="898" height="579" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/71f79e19-83b0-4b00-9103-c726165e1cc8_898x579.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:579,&quot;width&quot;:898,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:54730,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71f79e19-83b0-4b00-9103-c726165e1cc8_898x579.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71f79e19-83b0-4b00-9103-c726165e1cc8_898x579.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71f79e19-83b0-4b00-9103-c726165e1cc8_898x579.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71f79e19-83b0-4b00-9103-c726165e1cc8_898x579.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Source: Annual Company Filings</figcaption></figure></div><p>Among these companies, there are firms that have seen steady revenue, companies that have seen decreasing revenue, and companies that have seen increasing revenue from China.</p><h4>Steady Revenue</h4><p>In some cases, firms saw their revenue from China remain flat from 2016-20: companies like Intel saw their net revenue from China remain relatively low and steady, going from 24% in 2016 to 26% in 2020. In other cases, this is a high but steady figure: companies like Qualcomm have gone from 57% in 2016 to 60% in 2020. This is interesting because it suggests relatively steady demand for their products in the midst of a period of time where it was quite tumultuous to be a chip firm in the middle of the U.S. and China. </p><h4>Decreasing Revenue</h4><p>Several U.S. firms saw their revenue from China decline dramatically from 2016-20. Marvell (57% to 40%), Qorvo (61% to 34%), Broadcom (54% to 33%), and Micron (43% to 11%) were among these. First, its worth pointing out that all of these firms, except Micron, still derive 1/3rd of their total annual revenue from sales to China, even after a 5-year period of relative decline. Second, its worth pointing out that each of these firms is experiencing declines from an extremely high base. In general, it really isn&#8217;t sustainable for a company to derive 61% of its revenue from one country (Qualcomm being a clear exception) so some of this decline could be deliberate corporate de-risking (or just creative accounting changes). Third, it could also be that major Chinese customers of companies like Qorvo designed out some of their products in the past 5 years, resulting in lower sales. Finally, the declines Micron experienced seem like an outlier and are likely attributable to increasing Chinese memory chip purchases from SK Hynix and Samsung (Micron&#8217;s two main competitors, both of whom have large and recently-expanded memory fabs in China),  not necessarily an increase in domestic Chinese HQ&#8217;d company memory chip production displacing Micron&#8217;s sales in-country.</p><h4>Increasing Revenue:</h4><p>Several U.S. companies saw their revenue from China increase substantially from 2016-20. Texas Instruments (45% to 55%), Applied Materials (21% to 32%), Lam Research (18% to 31%),  and KLA (14% to 26%) were among these. These numbers understate the dramatic increase in these firms&#8217; revenue from China. Zooming out the camera a bit to include all 15 of these companies, there are some big numbers. Though many of these companies started from a &#8220;low&#8221; base in 2016, comparing the change in the actual $USD China net revenue in 2016 vs actual $USD China net revenue in 2020 is striking. </p><h5>Percent Change in Net Revenue Derived from China, 2016-20</h5><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd52fabf1-e29e-48e1-be50-dc6e10027433_538x368.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd52fabf1-e29e-48e1-be50-dc6e10027433_538x368.png" width="538" height="368" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d52fabf1-e29e-48e1-be50-dc6e10027433_538x368.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:368,&quot;width&quot;:538,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:79783,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd52fabf1-e29e-48e1-be50-dc6e10027433_538x368.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd52fabf1-e29e-48e1-be50-dc6e10027433_538x368.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd52fabf1-e29e-48e1-be50-dc6e10027433_538x368.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd52fabf1-e29e-48e1-be50-dc6e10027433_538x368.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Source: Annual Company Filings</figcaption></figure></div><p>In particular, the percent change in revenue from China between 2016 and 2020 for companies like KLA (248%), Nvidia (239%), and Lam Research (197%), with the backdrop of the trade war, is just stunning.

Micron remains and outlier. </p><p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: <em>an astute reader points out that in 2016, Micron reported &#8220;ship to location&#8221; and in 2020, they reported &#8220;reported based on geographical location of customers HQ.&#8221; So the outlier numbers described above and below are attributable to a reporting change. The reader suggests Micron&#8217;s revenue from China was probably between 8-15% over this 5 year period.</em></p><p><em>One important caveat</em> here is that all the firms&#8217; listed above, except for SME firms, are selling chips in to China but they have no idea where those chips go after that point. It could be that their chips are assembled in to a computer or smartphone and then re-exported to Germany or South Africa. It could be that their chips are assembled in to an Xbox and stay in China. These firms just report China net revenue based on customer ship-to location. Not necessarily the final destination of their chips. This caveat though is not relevant to SME firms, which are selling equipment directly to Chinese end user customers and its all staying in-country. Its worth looking at these SME firm numbers a little more closely:</p><h3>U.S. SME Firm Sales to China</h3><p>Semiconductor manufacturing equipment companies like KLA, Lam Research, Applied Materials, and Teradyne have been the big winners from 2016-20 with respect to China revenue. All saw their revenue from China go up by more than 100% from 2016-20. This is primarily due to Chinese construction of advanced fabs and Chinese firms&#8217; inability to make the SME needed to fill these advanced fabs. Demand for these firms&#8217; SME has just gone through the roof:</p><ul><li><p>Applied Materials saw its revenue from China grow from $2.25 billion in 2016 (21% of its total revenue) to $5.45 billion in 2020 (32% of its total revenue).</p></li><li><p>Lam Research saw its revenue from China grow from $1 billion in 2016 (18% of its total revenue) to $3 billion in 2020 (31% of its total revenue).</p></li><li><p>KLA saw its revenue from China grow from $430 million in 2016 (14% of its total revenue) to $1.49 billion in 2020 (26% of its total revenue).  </p></li></ul><p>Below is a (slightly dated and incomplete) list of China&#8217;s foundry and memory chip production in the last few years (and thus projects that will need SME from these companies). Note that most of these projects are still under construction, though some are probably on hold or delayed (Tsinghua Unigroup <a href="https://semiliterate.substack.com/p/tsinghua-unigroup-falls-and-chinas">filed for bankruptcy</a> etc.) It takes 2-4 years to build a fab once the permitting (which can take another couple years) is approved. Demand for SME in China looks high for the foreseeable:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe0c5333-1763-472c-852d-70a40c98c9ed_659x840.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe0c5333-1763-472c-852d-70a40c98c9ed_659x840.png" width="659" height="840" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fe0c5333-1763-472c-852d-70a40c98c9ed_659x840.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:840,&quot;width&quot;:659,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:218041,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe0c5333-1763-472c-852d-70a40c98c9ed_659x840.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe0c5333-1763-472c-852d-70a40c98c9ed_659x840.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe0c5333-1763-472c-852d-70a40c98c9ed_659x840.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe0c5333-1763-472c-852d-70a40c98c9ed_659x840.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4b815c2-6958-4e5b-aa95-6a6ebae1faf6_639x385.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4b815c2-6958-4e5b-aa95-6a6ebae1faf6_639x385.png" width="639" height="385" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c4b815c2-6958-4e5b-aa95-6a6ebae1faf6_639x385.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:385,&quot;width&quot;:639,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:97165,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4b815c2-6958-4e5b-aa95-6a6ebae1faf6_639x385.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4b815c2-6958-4e5b-aa95-6a6ebae1faf6_639x385.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4b815c2-6958-4e5b-aa95-6a6ebae1faf6_639x385.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4b815c2-6958-4e5b-aa95-6a6ebae1faf6_639x385.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Source: <a href="https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/journals/chinese_semiconductor_industrial_policy_prospects_for_success_jice_aug_2019.pdf">USITC</a>.

Historically, one way to guarantee market access in China was for multinational corporations to build factories that promise to serve the Chinese market (every industry did this from planes, to trains, to automobiles). Interestingly, however, the trend seems to be that these firms&#8217; investments in China are steady to declining (unlike their sales to China, which were clearly steady to increasing).</p><p>For a variety of reasons, there are a dwindling number of fabs operated by U.S.-headquartered companies in China. Notably, Intel recently <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-sells-nand-fab-ssd-business-sk-hynix-9-billion-dollars">divested </a>its Dalian fab in a sale to SK Hynix, though the company still maintains a large ATP facility in Chengdu. Of this sample of 15 publicly traded U.S. chip companies, the only U.S. integrated device manufacturer with a fab left in China is Texas Instruments. Several U.S. firms however maintain substantial assembly, test, and/or packaging facilities in China and a few SME firms also have significant manufacturing operations at factories in China, notably KLA and Teradyne.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d6d0781-d9c7-4432-9d8d-e36b5577b1a8_473x283.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d6d0781-d9c7-4432-9d8d-e36b5577b1a8_473x283.png" width="473" height="283" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7d6d0781-d9c7-4432-9d8d-e36b5577b1a8_473x283.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:283,&quot;width&quot;:473,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:27643,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d6d0781-d9c7-4432-9d8d-e36b5577b1a8_473x283.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d6d0781-d9c7-4432-9d8d-e36b5577b1a8_473x283.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d6d0781-d9c7-4432-9d8d-e36b5577b1a8_473x283.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d6d0781-d9c7-4432-9d8d-e36b5577b1a8_473x283.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Looking at the value of these investments as it is presented in financial disclosures (generally under &#8220;long-lived assets&#8221;

It has a large ATP facility in Shanghai and similarly large facilities spread around SE Asia. It is a U.S. company in name only when it comes to physical assets. Notably, Micron, ON, and Western Digital also have relatively little PPE in the U.S., indicative of the fact that the vast majority of their fabs and manufacturing work is done in places other than the U.S. and China (all three have big fabs spread around Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, and Japan). Conversely, the vast majority of Qorvo, Intel and TI&#8217;s assets are concentrated in the U.S.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>There has been a lot of talk the last few years about the effect of trade wars, export controls, and U.S.-China friction on the semiconductor industry. This basic analysis shows that, at least for this sample of firms, U.S. chip company operations w/r/t China have been largely uninterrupted. In fact, for the vast majority of companies the last 5 years of business in China have been truly outstanding financially. U.S. chip firms have seemingly weathered the turbulent past 5 years without too much trouble.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spotting the Next Big Thing in Semiconductors]]></title><description><![CDATA[Welcome to SemiLiterate, a guide to the chip industry through the lens of public policy.

For individuals interested in tracking emerging trends in the semiconductor industry, an eye for synthesizing seemingly idiosyncratic developments is essential. That is what this post is about.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Before getting in to the weeds, some observations Paul Graham made about 10 years ago about the nature of venture capital investing <a href="http://paulgraham.com/swan.html">are worth keeping in mind</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The two most important things to understand about startup investing are that: </p><p>(1) effectively all the returns are concentrated in a few big winners, and </p><p>(2) the best ideas look initially like bad ideas.  </p></blockquote><p>These seem like instructive observations to clarify thinking about the future of the semiconductor industry. Until very recently, any idea that diverged radically from Moore&#8217;s Law was, by definition, a bad idea. This industry has ridden an innovation gravy train for 65 years. That gravy train has had a few big winners.</p><p>But today, these incumbent winners (ex. Intel) are generally faltering or have been eclipsed by new winners (ex. TSMC) who are riding the same gravy train. Many companies and governments think that the solution to their woes is simply finding a way back on this train, seemingly without caring that the end of the tracks is in sight. This is the sort of short term thinking that is characteristic of an industry that has operated on 18-24 month cycles of innovation for 6+ decades with great success.</p><p>This short term thinking won&#8217;t invent the future. To invent the future, companies and governments need to survey the landscape and ask &#8220;How do we fund &#8220;bad&#8221; ideas that result in a few big winners?&#8221; This post is about long-term thinking for a short-term industry: how to accelerate the arrival of a post-Moore&#8217;s Law future.</p><h3>&#8220;How to fund &#8220;bad&#8221; ideas that result in a few big winners?&#8221;</h3><p>A few assumptions and observations up front: </p><ul><li><p>First, the future of the semiconductor industry is not going to be invented by any of the incumbent leaders in the semiconductor industry. Its hard to develop new things in big organizations. From ion implantation in the 1970s to chemical mechanical polishing in the 1980s to copper interconnects in the 1990s to FinFET in the 2000s and EUV in the 2010s, paradigm shifting innovations have generally not <em>started </em>with incumbent leaders. Semiconductor incumbents are quick <em>adopters</em>, not necessarily adept innovators. </p></li><li><p>Second, many of the paradigm shifting innovations in the semiconductor industry have happened via perceived &#8220;outlier&#8221; parts of the industry.</p></li><li><p>Third, big winners are optimal. Governments want national champions, companies want monopolies. Both pursue policies to that end.</p></li><li><p>Fourth, big winners and their breakthroughs can emerge anywhere in the &#8220;stack&#8221; that composes the semiconductor industry and change the rest of it.</p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbed92533-e3b1-46a1-a3e7-7910a3e8837d_648x411.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbed92533-e3b1-46a1-a3e7-7910a3e8837d_648x411.png" width="648" height="411" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bed92533-e3b1-46a1-a3e7-7910a3e8837d_648x411.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:411,&quot;width&quot;:648,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:209607,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbed92533-e3b1-46a1-a3e7-7910a3e8837d_648x411.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbed92533-e3b1-46a1-a3e7-7910a3e8837d_648x411.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbed92533-e3b1-46a1-a3e7-7910a3e8837d_648x411.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbed92533-e3b1-46a1-a3e7-7910a3e8837d_648x411.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h4>Historical Interlude</h4><p>If you had asked anyone in the 1980s about the utility of using a high powered laser to incinerate falling pieces of metal to generate a specific wavelength of light that would then be used to impart minute circuitry on wafers in a vacuum chamber they would have probably said &#8220;thanks but no thanks.&#8221; Yet that is exactly when the history of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) began: development started in the 1980s with fundamental research done in the US and Japan on the use of soft X-rays, leading to the first demonstration of the technology in 1986. In the 1990s and early 2000s, NTT in Japan, Bell Labs and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the US and the University of Twente in the Netherlands further pushed the research in this technology. ASML (Netherlands) then sought to further develop and commercialize EUV in partnership with institutions like IMEC (Belgium) and corporations including Intel (US), Samsung (South Korea), and TSMC (Taiwan). Today ASML enjoys a pure monopoly on the sale of EUV tools. Every company in the world wants to find themselves in this position 30 years from now. The question is where to start looking.</p><h3>Step One</h3><p>Step one is identifying &#8220;bad&#8221; ideas that have the right ingredients. Peter Thiel was <a href="https://nixonseminar.com/2021/04/the-nixon-seminar-april-6-2021-transcript">interviewed </a>by Mike Pompeo and Matt Pottinger in April and had some interesting observations on the semiconductor startup ecosystem:</p><blockquote><p>One of the very strange dynamics in Silicon Valley is people don&#8217;t do very much with semiconductors anymore. I am a venture capitalist. I get pitched on semiconductor startups every few years, but then it&#8217;s always, &#8216;I haven&#8217;t done much with it, I don&#8217;t know what is going on and it seems expensive and complicated,&#8217; and I think one of the weird problems with 20 years of intellectual property theft, and where IP doesn&#8217;t really have as much value as you used to, is that you learn not to invest in things like that&#8230; I think we are still ahead of [China] in lots of ways on the [semiconductor] design side. It is one of the places where we can do more to block China than they can do to block us, but we have lost a lot of ground in the last 20 years.</p></blockquote><p>For a famously iconoclastic thinker, this is an odd blind spot. If your priors lead you to believe investing in semiconductors is a bad idea, shouldn&#8217;t you then be on the look out for exceptions to your rule? After all, the best ideas initially look like a bad ideas. And it sounds like semiconductor investments are a very bad idea in his opinion.</p><p>This is a decent starting point when looking for ideas about the post-Moore&#8217;s Law future: if at any point in the future Peter Thiel invests in a semiconductor startup, that seems like a signal that the startup must <em>really</em> be on to something. To generalize this, you want to look for outlier investments by successful investors who have limited history (or known skepticism) of betting on this industry.</p><p>One example of this is <a href="https://luminous.co/">Luminous Computing</a>, a small company (46 employees on LinkedIn currently) who humbly state their mission is &#8220;to create a single AI training and inference chip that will outperform the world's largest supercomputer.&#8221; They&#8217;re developing a silicon photonic AI chip (a chip that processes information via light), have been in stealth mode for years, have advertised employment vacancies which indicate they already fabricated test chips, and randomly landed an investment from Bill Gates (who is not known for his big bets on semiconductor hardware). Perhaps we should all be paying more attention to photonics these days. </p><h3>Step Two</h3><p>Sticking with this theme of &#8220;follow the smart people,&#8221; when looking for signs of a post-Moore&#8217;s Law future we should all simply pay more attention to wherever Jim Keller is working and whatever he is working on. The idea of a &#8220;celebrity&#8221; chip designer is laughable, but he is as close as it gets. Jim Keller is one reason AMD is enjoying its renaissance and the reason Tesla&#8217;s full self driving chip exists. Before his stint at AMD, he helped get Apple&#8217;s silicon division off the ground and after his departure from Tesla he spent two years trying to fix Intel&#8217;s chip division. And then six months ago he started working for Tenstorrent.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8a6a64c-540b-4fa7-a4a2-3e094f9856c0_583x458.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8a6a64c-540b-4fa7-a4a2-3e094f9856c0_583x458.png" width="583" height="458" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c8a6a64c-540b-4fa7-a4a2-3e094f9856c0_583x458.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:458,&quot;width&quot;:583,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:41097,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8a6a64c-540b-4fa7-a4a2-3e094f9856c0_583x458.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8a6a64c-540b-4fa7-a4a2-3e094f9856c0_583x458.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8a6a64c-540b-4fa7-a4a2-3e094f9856c0_583x458.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8a6a64c-540b-4fa7-a4a2-3e094f9856c0_583x458.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Source: <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16354/jim-keller-becomes-cto-at-tenstorrent-the-most-promising-architecture-out-there">AnandTech</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>If you&#8217;ve never heard of Tenstorrent, you&#8217;re far from alone. Jim thinks &#8220;it is the most promising chip architecture out there,&#8221; which is the sort of praise you&#8217;d expect from the company president/chief technology officer. But its also a huge endorsement because, as his work experience shows, he doesn&#8217;t really waste his time on lost causes.</p><p>Tenstorrent is an AI chip design company that creates and designs silicon for machine learning, uses GlobalFoundries to fabricate the hardware, and works with partners to create solutions (as in, chips + system + software + optimizations for that customer). What is most interesting is that soon after joining in company January 2021, Tenstorrent <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/tenstorrent-licenses-risc-v">licensed </a>a general-purpose CPU design developed by SiFive based on the RISC-V architecture as their AI system on chip in April 2021. Then in May 2021 Tenstorrent <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/89763-jim-keller-tenstorrent-secures-200-million-new-funding.html">secured </a>another $200 million of funding, valuing it at $1 billion. And in early June Intel made a $2 billion <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-offers-dollar2-billion-for-risc-v-startup-sifive-bloomberg">offer </a>for SiFive.</p><p>These developments are a huge vote of confidence for RISC-V: an open source instruction set architecture (ISA) that forms the basis of chip designs. When the leading chip designer of his generation chooses your design for the backbone of his startup&#8217;s product and the leading firm commercializing this ISA gets a $2 billion offer from Intel all in the same month, its a vote of confidence. For a long time (since the 1980s, in fact) RISC-V has been a &#8220;bad&#8221; idea. Maybe not so much any more.</p><p>(Unrelated: if you have the time, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4hL5Om4IJ4">listen to this podcast interview of Keller</a>. The guy is so smart he can actually explain how chips work to normal humans.)</p><h3>Step Three</h3><p>Moving on from our theme of &#8220;follow the smart people&#8221; as we look for bad ideas that result in big winners, the next stop is &#8220;follow the smart organizations that have a history of funding high risk-high payoff ideas and incentivizing fast failure.&#8221; Or, look at what DARPA&#8217;s Microsystems Technology Office (MTO) is doing. The MTO funded the breakthroughs which led to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FinFET#:~:text=A%20fin%20field%2Deffect%20transistor,or%20even%20multi%20gate%20structure.">FinFET </a>in the mid 2000s, allowing scaling to 14nm and below. DARPA helpfully talks about the MTO&#8217;s current focus in very straightforward detail in the context of its <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/electronics-resurgence-initiative">Electronics Resurgence Initiative</a> (ERI). ERI&#8217;s investments are focused on:</p><ul><li><p>increasing information processing density and efficiency,</p></li><li><p>accelerating innovation in artificial intelligence hardware to make decisions at the edge faster,</p></li><li><p>hardware to make decisions at the edge faster,</p></li><li><p>overcoming the inherent throughput limits of 2D electronics,</p></li><li><p>mitigating the skyrocketing costs of electronic design,</p></li><li><p>overcoming security threats across the entire hardware lifecycle, and</p></li><li><p>revolutionizing communications (5G and beyond).</p></li></ul><p>Within each of these categories, DARPA is sponsoring one or more sub-projects. For example, within the &#8220;Mitigating the Skyrocketing Costs of Electronic Design&#8221; category, DARPA has projects on:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/common-heterogeneous-integration-and-ip-reuse-strategies">Common Heterogeneous Integration and IP Reuse Strategies (CHIPS)</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/intelligent-design-of-electronic-assets">Intelligent Design of Electronic Assets (IDEA)</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/posh-open-source-hardware">Posh Open Source Hardware (POSH)</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/real-time-machine-learning">Real Time Machine Learning (RTML)</a></p></li></ul><p>The two program managers of these four programs come from Sandia National Lab and Mentor Graphics (now owned by Siemens), one of the &#8220;big three&#8221; EDA companies. Their primary focus is on accelerating hardware design cycle times, developing modular/reusable IP blocks, establishing a system to verify the security of electronics designed in open source hardware IP ecosystems, and developing a program that will fully automate design of machine learning-optimized chips based on real world inputs.  All four of these projects seem worthy, but it&#8217;s hard to know their viability until the period of performance is over.</p><h3>Step Four:</h3><p>This does however lead to a fourth point, which is &#8220;look for areas where business and government are <em>both </em>spending their time/resources&#8221; as a signal that the environment might be changing in favor of the &#8220;bad&#8221; ideas. Challenging an oligopoly is generally a terrible idea. And Cadence, Mentor, and Synopsys have controlled the Electronic Design Automation environment for decades, simply buying up emerging competitors before they had a chance to eat in to their market share.</p><p>But U.S. export controls on EDA tools are accelerating the Chinese industry&#8217;s development of indigenous EDA tools and the Chinese government is certainly willing to spend whatever it takes to help develop a commercially viable indigenous semiconductor ecosystem that doesn&#8217;t rely on any U.S. components. Cadence, Mentor, and Synopsys will likely slowly lose market share, its just a matter of time.</p><p>More interestingly, it appears Google decided that it was time to partially cut out the oligopoly. Google <a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2021/05/14/google-bigchip/">apparently developed an in-house EDA tool</a> to design one of its in-house chips. This is indicative of a trend more generally: <a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2021/05/13/who-wants-to-build-a-chip/">big technology companies are getting in the hardware game</a>. But they are not doing so in a half-hearted or one-off manner. Apple Silicon is competing with some of the leading semiconductor companies in the world, Google&#8217;s tensor processing unit changed the artificial intelligence hardware landscape, and Microsoft/Facebook/Amazon are all placing their hardware bets too. Big tech companies can afford to invest time and money in places where they perceive market inefficiencies. EDA is a great example of this, and one that until recently would have been seen as a &#8220;bad&#8221; idea to invest resources in. These are after all large profitable businesses because they studiously avoid making massively bad bets. For example, while it is notable Google and DARPA are keen on innovating in the EDA space, it remains exceedingly unlikely any big tech company gets in the foundry business any time soon.</p><p>These developments are arguably accelerating. A few weeks ago researchers from Google announced in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03544-w">Nature </a>that they used AI to partially design Google&#8217;s next AI chip: </p><blockquote><p>The AI now needs fewer than six hours to generate chip floorplans that match or beat human-produced designs at power consumption, performance, and area. Expert humans typically need months of iteration to do this task.</p></blockquote><h3>Conclusion/Step Five: Tying It All Together</h3><p>What could patent applications, publications, and M&amp;A told us about the technology readiness level of EUV in the 1990s and 2000s? Should we have all guessed it was going to work out in 2012 when ASML <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asml-cymer/chip-gear-maker-asml-buys-cymer-for-2-5-billion-idUSBRE89G08R20121017#:~:text=AMSTERDAM%20(Reuters)%20%2D%20ASML%2C,smarter%20chips%20of%20the%20future.">bought</a> Cymer?</p><p>Recall the Historical Interlude from above about how ASML&#8217;s EUV system started. The ingredients look very logical in hindsight: fundamental research being done on an existing technology through an industry/government partnership that pushed the research up the technology readiness level &#8220;stack.&#8221; That research pulled the technology in to areas it previously had not been applied until, eventually, the good idea became so compelling that a company decided to make a relatively big bet to commercialize it. That company then has to apply a decade of patient capital but up inventing the future and is enjoying the returns. Perhaps the developments we&#8217;re seeing today in silicon photonics, RISC-V, and EDA will look as logical in hindsight.</p><p>There are lessons to be learned, but in the short term we should all spend more time watching for iconoclastic investments, tracking where the smart people work (and what they work on), observing what the smart organizations are funding, and analyzing where incumbent tech companies are burning their cash for signs of an approaching post-Moore&#8217;s Law future.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Spend $39 Billion]]></title><description><![CDATA[Most CHIPS Act funds are already spent, we just don't realize it]]></description><link>https://semiliterate.substack.com/p/how-to-spend-39-billion</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://semiliterate.substack.com/p/how-to-spend-39-billion</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Semi-Literate]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jun 2021 15:18:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95fb634a-a0ec-4b2d-bc37-28e46b8bcaf9_802x632.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Welcome to SemiLiterate, a guide to the chip industry through the lens of public policy. </em></p><div><hr></div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLUF_(communication)">BLUF</a>: This post summarizes known and likely recipients of CHIPS Act funding.

The CHIPS Act, one of the many provisions in the USICA, directs $52 billion of funding towards the semiconductor industry. $39 billion of this funding is to be spent exclusively on building new semiconductor factories (&#8220;fabs&#8221;), and the Commerce Secretary has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-chip-funding-could-result-seven-10-new-factories-officials-2021-05-24/">publicly estimated</a> there will be 7-10 new fabs that come out of this effort.

Starting with the more-obvious ones who are likely going to receive the maximum $3 billion incentive:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmc-says-construction-has-started-arizona-chip-factory-2021-06-01/">TSMC</a> (Arizona) - $3 billion incentive</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2021/05/21/samsung-says-no-decision-has-been-made-for-plant.html">Samsung </a>(State TBD) - $3 billion incentive</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/idm-manufacturing-innovation-product-leadership.html">Intel </a>(Arizona) - $3 billion incentive</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.timesunion.com/business/article/Schumer-pushes-Micron-to-build-a-fab-in-upstate-16208099.php">Micron </a>(Virginia) - $3 billion incentive</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.reliableplant.com/Read/24280/Texas-Instruments-increases-capacity">Texas Instruments</a> (Texas) - $3&gt; billion incentive</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16531/globalfoundries-to-co-invest-1-4-billion-usd">GlobalFoundries</a> (NY) - $3&gt; billion incentive</p></li></ul><p>There are also many companies who are eligible for CHIPS Act funds that will get less than the full $3 billion incentive (they&#8217;re not going to build an entirely new chip factory, but maybe they will upgrade existing factory lines from 200mm wafers to 300 mm wafers, for example). These companies in particular might target the pot of money earmarked for &#8220;legacy&#8221; chip production &#8220;essential to the auto industry, the military, and other critical industries.&#8221; Below is a list of these companies, the states where their current fabs are located, and thus where they&#8217;re likely to build/expand operations using CHIPS Act funds:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.skywatertechnology.com/press-releases/skywater-expanding-with-florida-facility-to-accelerate-domestic-advanced-packaging-capabilities-for-microelectronics-manufacturing/">SkyWater Technology Foundry</a> (MN or FL) - $1&lt; billion</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.qorvo.com/newsroom/news/2021/semiconductor-industry-applauds-ndaa-enactment-urges-full-funding">Qorvo </a>(NC or TX) - $1&gt; billion</p></li><li><p>Microchip (AZ or OR) - $1&gt; billion</p></li><li><p>ON Semi (ID or OR) - $1&gt; billion </p></li><li><p>Analog Devices (CA) - $1&gt; billion</p></li><li><p>Honeywell (MN) - $1&gt; billion</p></li><li><p>Broadcom (PA or CO) - $1&gt; billion</p></li><li><p>NXP Semiconductor (AZ or TX) - $1&gt; billion</p></li><li><p>Infineon - (TX or CA) - $1&gt; billion</p></li><li><p>TowerJazz - (CA or TX) - $1&gt; billion</p></li><li><p>CREE - (NC) - $1&gt; billion</p></li><li><p>MACOM - (MA or CA) - $1&gt; billion</p></li></ul><h3>Implications</h3><p>That&#8217;s a lot of money to send out the door in a very short period of time. In fact, the back-of-the-envelope numbers indicate over 50% (~$20 billion) of the CHIPS Act funds for semiconductor manufacturing incentives are already spoken for, and it isn&#8217;t even law yet. That&#8217;s actually a pretty conservative number and there are a couple of other things that could revise this calculation upwards quickly:</p><ul><li><p>Unexpected Investments:</p><ul><li><p>Kioxia (Japan), SK Hynix (South Korea), UMC (Taiwan) and Renesas (Japan) are all major semiconductor manufactures that are theoretically eligible for these incentives but have not indicated any interest in expanding their U.S. presence. If they were to do so, any one of them would be able to take advantage of up to $3 billion in funding and draw down the pot of funds even further.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Preferential Funding for DoD-affiliates:</p><ul><li><p>That Axios graphic linked to above actually undercounts the number of fab lines in the U.S. substantially because it lacks all of the in-house fabs operated by big defense contractors: BAE Systems, HRL Laboratories, Northrup Grumman, Raytheon, SRI International and TSI Semiconductors are all accredited for providing <a href="https://www.dmea.osd.mil/otherdocs/AccreditedSuppliers.pdf">Trusted Foundry Services</a> (pdf) by DOD/DMEA. There will be substantial competition for DOD earmarked funds which may put pressure on the larger pot of money.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Fuzzy Eligibility:</p><ul><li><p>If these funds are made available to manufacturers of semiconductors other than just integrated circuits, there could be further increased demand: companies like Vishay Intertechnology and Rogue Valley Microdevices which make MEMS (microelectronic mechanical systems) might get in on the funding too.</p></li><li><p>There are also several universities that operate fabs. If the small fabs at places like MIT Lincoln Labs and University of Florida are eligible for funding, this pot of money goes away fast.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h3>Next Steps/Conclusion</h3><p>The United States Innovation and Competition Act of 2021 is now headed to the House. It seems relatively safe to assume that the top-line number of $52 billion will remain mostly unchanged as this area/industry enjoys a moment of bipartisan support. But, there are only a few weeks before summer recess and the legislative calendar is already full, so the timing of its passage and actual signing in to law remains unknown (September, maybe?). </p><p>The CHIPS Act focus on fabrication over innovation is understandable but unfortunate. Most industry-watchers do not believe that Intel or TSMC is going to invent the future of the semiconductor industry. Yet this Act directs the vast majority of its funding to those (and similar) companies. Hopefully these large companies will use their CHIPS Act funds to see the CMOS roadmap/Moore&#8217;s Law to its very end and reinvest some of their profits in in-house R&amp;D/workforce development that perpetuates their competitiveness in the short to medium term.</p><p>However this Act does not guarantee any long term competitiveness for the U.S. industry. For that to happen, the other Commerce Department programs like the NSTC and advanced packaging initiative will have to strategically allocate a relatively small pot of money to create the incentives, commercialization roadmaps, and workforce necessary to invent the future of a non-CMOS semiconductor industry. A later post will focus on how Commerce could most effectively stand up these programs to increase the probability the innovations they fund meaningfully increase the U.S. industry&#8217;s competitiveness. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[From Cyclotrons to Stockpiling: Mitigating Semiconductor Supply Chain Risks]]></title><description><![CDATA[Part 2 of a series focused on supply chains.]]></description><link>https://semiliterate.substack.com/p/from-cyclotrons-to-stockpiling-mitigating</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://semiliterate.substack.com/p/from-cyclotrons-to-stockpiling-mitigating</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Semi-Literate]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 23 May 2021 14:42:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d6c1669-437a-4636-858c-6b6599e4d102_871x328.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Welcome to SemiLiterate, a guide to the chip industry through the lens of public policy.

These strategies include stockpiling, increasing production/capacity (domestic or allied), developing substitutes, and recycling. Each option comes with constraints: basic availability, competing technology demand, political/regulatory/social factors, co-dependence on other markets, and producer diversity.

Comments were submitted by a wide range of companies, industry associations, and startups and included a striking amount of information about risks facing the semiconductor supply chain. Helpfully, they also included quite a bit of information about proposed solutions to mitigate these risks. This post summarizes proposed solutions, adding some context and analysis.</p><h3>Introduction</h3><p>I ended Part 1 of this series on semiconductor supply chains by posing questions:</p><blockquote><p>What tiers of what supply chains should a country focus on securing? Is it product-specific (memory chips?) or process-step (materials, EDA) specific?</p><p>What supply chain risks should be mitigated, what supply chain risks must be accepted because they are too expensive/expansive to mitigate?</p><p>When is the supply chain considered &#8220;secure&#8221;? Define the goal.</p><p>How broadly does one define supply chain security? Is human capital part of the supply chain? If so, what does it mean to &#8220;secure&#8221; it?</p><p>What role does regulation play as a risk in the semiconductor industry (ex. Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, Trusted Foundry program, EPA)?</p></blockquote><p><em><strong>The (partial) answer is</strong></em>: the government needs to identify semiconductor supply chain chokepoints for which there is no commercial or economic case for mitigating those chokepoints. Then, the government needs to provide incentives that buy-down the cost/risk associated with mitigating those chokepoints such that commercial firms re-align their operations to address that risk. The solution to semiconductor supply chain risks is market-driven but government-enabled.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d6c1669-437a-4636-858c-6b6599e4d102_871x328.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d6c1669-437a-4636-858c-6b6599e4d102_871x328.png" width="871" height="328" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4d6c1669-437a-4636-858c-6b6599e4d102_871x328.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:328,&quot;width&quot;:871,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:507175,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d6c1669-437a-4636-858c-6b6599e4d102_871x328.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d6c1669-437a-4636-858c-6b6599e4d102_871x328.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d6c1669-437a-4636-858c-6b6599e4d102_871x328.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d6c1669-437a-4636-858c-6b6599e4d102_871x328.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Geographic locations of 6 IDMs. From <a href="https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SIA-Beyond-Borders-Report-FINAL-June-7.pdf">SIA</a>.</figcaption></figure></div><h3>Understanding the Risks:</h3><p>To mitigate vulnerabilities, you have to first identify the risks. Part 1 of this series was focused on identifying a sub-set of semiconductor supply chain risks: single and sole source products or services whose interruption (deliberate or accidental) could disrupt semiconductor production. But there are many other types of risk affecting the chip industry, some of which were identified by commenters to BIS:</p><p><strong>Company-Specific Risks</strong>: single/sole source suppliers, infrastructure failures, bankruptcies, counterfeiting, IP theft, product tampering, cybersecurity</p><p><strong>Country-Specific Risks</strong>: currency manipulation, subsidies, predatory FDI, immigration restrictions, tariffs, standards/technical barriers to trade, environmental regulations, tax changes</p><p><strong>Industry-Specific Risks</strong>: single/sole source suppliers, workforce/human capital, lack of adequate public infrastructure, innovation roadblocks</p><p><strong>Regional Risks</strong>: natural disasters, geopolitics, armed conflict, expropriation</p><h2>Mitigating Semiconductor Supply Chain Risk</h2><p>Commenters to BIS identified two types of solutions to risks above: </p><ul><li><p><em><strong>Market-driven solutions</strong></em> are the sorts of supply chain mitigation the industry is capable of doing unilaterally, without support from the government, because there are economic incentives for following these best practices. </p></li><li><p><em><strong>Government-led solutions</strong></em>, in contrast, are efforts for which economic incentives may be lacking but the strategic imperative is compelling enough that government funds/leadership can (and sometimes should) bridge the gap. </p></li></ul><h3><strong>Market-Driven Solutions:</strong></h3><p><strong>Fabs Exert a Gravitational Pull</strong>: multiple Taiwanese chemical and gas suppliers <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2021-0011-0013">noted </a>they were interested in building facilities in the United States to be in close geographic proximity to TSMC&#8217;s new Arizona fab. Fabs like suppliers to be near by. More fabs = greater upstream materials supply chain security.</p><p><strong>Supply Chain Security Standards</strong>: <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2021-0011-0095">Intel </a>noted that it enforces an ISO standard on its suppliers. Large semiconductor companies can enforce supply chain best practices through their outsized importance to upstream suppliers.</p><p><strong>Joint Development Projects</strong>: Multiple companies <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2021-0011-0065">pointed</a> to IMEC as the gold standard of public-private R&amp;D partnerships in this industry. Modeling future pre-competitive innovation partnerships on IMEC&#8217;s best practices would result in enthusiastic company participation.</p><p><strong>Corporate Strategic Investment Incentives</strong>: Most large semiconductor companies operate a venture capital arm to invest in promising startups (ex. Intel Capital, Applied Ventures). Finding ways to increase their investment in startups will help innovation.</p><p><strong>Recycling</strong>: There is a tremendous amount of material waste in the semiconductor industry. Companies already recycle some materials to save money and increasing this practice would have derivative environmental and supply chain benefits.</p><h3>Government-Led Solutions:</h3><p>Commenters proposed a huge variety of government-led solutions to semiconductor supply chain risks:</p><h4>Workforce:</h4><p><strong>Talent programs</strong>: <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2021-0011-0094">Commenters </a>called for an expansion of SRC-DARPA JUMP: C-BRIC, SRC-NSF nCORE: CAPSL, SRC-NIST nCORE: NEW LIMITS), SRC: CHIRP, and NSF-SRC collaborations targeting semiconductor workforce development.</p><p><strong>Database of Students Studying Chip-related fields</strong>: <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2021-0011-0046">create </a>a national database of students studying semiconductor-related fields for prospective employers to hire from.</p><h4>Stockpile:</h4><p><strong>Raw materials</strong>: strategic purchases and stockpiling of essential materials, chemicals, and gases used in semiconductor manufacturing, perhaps modeled along the lines of the <a href="https://www.dla.mil/HQ/Acquisition/StrategicMaterials.aspx">Defense Logistics Agency&#8217;s Strategic Materials program</a>, was suggested.</p><p><strong>Purchase EOL equipment</strong>: U.S. government purchases of end-of-life semiconductor manufacturing equipment that is being sold by chip firms that no longer need it was <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2021-0011-0018">suggested </a>as a means to create a strategic stockpile.</p><h4>Information Gathering and Assessment:</h4><p><strong>National Supply Chain Registry</strong>: create a national registry of information about supply chain risks and best practices affecting the chip industry. </p><p><strong>Change how BIS TACs Function</strong>: Bureau of Industry and Security Technical Advisory Committees (TACs) could be re-vamped to provide technical information on supply chain security in addition to their normal function on export controls.</p><h4>Regulatory Best Practices:</h4><p><strong>EPA Fab Permitting Efficiencies: </strong>the U.S. builds fabs far more slowly than the rest of the world due in part to delays in EPA permitting of factory construction. <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2021-0011-0067">Commenters </a>noted easing this regulatory burden would facilitate faster fab construction times.</p><p><strong>Remove Tariffs on Chemicals and Silicon Ingot Pullers</strong>: There are apparently tariffs on several China-origin semiconductor-related products still in effect from the Section 301 tariffs. U.S. firms <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2021-0011-0010">called </a>for their removal.</p><p><strong>Tax Credits and Abatements</strong>: A variety of <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2021-0011-0010">commenters </a>suggested tweaking the tax code to change how chip companies can depreciate the value of their equipment and other tax incentive strategies that would make it cheaper/easier to do business in the U.S. for the chip industry.</p><h4>Funding Innovation:</h4><p><strong>Copy Centers of Excellence</strong>: <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2021-0011-0094">Commenters </a>pointed to The Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) of Taiwan, Fraunhofer Group for Microelectronics of Germany, IMEC of Belgium, and The Institute of Microelectronics (IME) of Singapore as models of innovative R&amp;D partnerships whose structure is worth emulating.</p><p><strong>SBIR Reform: </strong><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2021-0011-0029">commenters </a>asserted the SBIR program is not designed to allow semiconductor and advanced packaging startups to invest in the capital needed to develop scalable manufacturing operations in the U.S. They suggested expanding matching fund programs like the SBIR Phase 2B program. This funding can support larger innovations long enough to get to a stage when they become ready for investors.</p><p><strong>Manufacturing USA:</strong> Commenters were mixed - some <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2021-0011-0046">called </a>for Manufacturing USA funding to be increased, others <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2021-0011-0086">criticized </a>the programs as vulnerable to agenda-capture by large corporate members and lacking commercialization strategies.</p><p><strong>NSF Reform:</strong> Commenters noted The National Science Foundation does not currently have a dedicated program for funding EDA research, and its investments in this area have declined over the past two decades. They <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2021-0011-0062">recommended </a>NSF fund additional research in to Electronic Photonic Co-Design EPDA tools.</p><p><strong>Microelectronics Commons (DARPA)</strong>: <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2021-0011-0094">Commenters </a>noted DARPA&#8217;s plans are still evolving with respect to developing a &#8220;Microelectronics Commons&#8221; as part of its Electronics Resurgence Initiative. ((<a href="https://govtribe.com/opportunity/federal-contract-opportunity/request-for-information-microelectronics-rd-facility-capabilities-for-prototyping-darpasn2106">DARPA-SN-21-06, Request for Information (RFI</a>)). Commenters noted the need for a space for pre-competitive microelectronics innovation between companies and startups. </p><h4>Build Infrastructure:</h4><p><strong>Build more fabs</strong>: self-explanatory. This is kinda the whole point of the exercise.</p><p><strong>Rad Hard Test Facilities</strong>: there is an extreme deficit of radiation hardness test infrastructure nationally and this presents a chokepoint for OSAT of electronics that need to be tested for radiation hardness before they are assembled in to products bound for radiation saturated environments (space). With companies like SpaceX, Project Kuiper, and Blue Origin all launching more electronics in to space, demand for these testing services is expect to grow dramatically and will necessitate construction of new cyclotrons. <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2021-0011-0084">Commenters</a> pointed out need for new infrastructure.</p><p><strong>Diversify Geographic Concentration of Talent, Water, Electricity: </strong>A typical semiconductor production facility uses ~2-5 million gallons of water per day. A large production facility can use up to 30-50 megawatts of peak electrical capacity, enough to power a small city. <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2021-0011-0082">Commenters </a>suggested maybe not building new fabs in deserts. </p><h3>There Are No Solutions, Only Tradeoffs</h3><p>A lot of these ideas are good in theory and might work in a vacuum (absent competition and innovation), but every solution comes with tradeoffs. </p><h4>Regulation is going to make or break efforts to mitigate semiconductor supply chain risk</h4><p>The EPA permitting process for fab construction creates huge delays. The Department of Interior restricts mining on federal lands which hold deposits of materials needed for semiconductor manufacturing. USTR still has tariffs on some semiconductor-related products from China. The EPA regulates the use of many chemicals used in semiconductor manufacturing, increasing costs and injecting uncertainty. US immigration policies keep talent from staying in the U.S. or even entering the country. BLM is selling down the Federal Helium Reserve. The Biden Administration has committed the U.S. to the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which will effectively limit how much the U.S. chip industry can use hydrofluorocarbons going forward (an intensively consumed, but environmentally problematic, gas). All of these regulations raise the cost of doing business as a chip company in the U.S. and could undermine semiconductor supply chain resiliency efforts. </p><h4>Innovation &lt; Fabrication</h4><p><a href="https://semiliterate.substack.com/p/the-chips-act-microelectronics-and">We&#8217;ve already talked about how the CHIPS Act prioritizes funding for new fabrication over new innovation</a>. The Act will help large corporations become more globally competitive, but these companies will not necessarily fulfill the needs of the US government nor invent the future of non-CMOS semiconductors. Commenters point out again and again the traditional way the government funds R&amp;D (DARPA, NSF, SBIR, Manufacturing USA, OTAs) are not creating the conditions this industry needs for innovation but are instead mainly benefitting large established companies. There needs to be more emphasis on innovation. Comments from <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2021-0011-0065">one startup</a> in particular highlight this problem: </p><blockquote><p>When we started our EUV [chemical] development work there were two facilities that we considered as development partners: the now defunct SEMATECH (Albany, New York) and IMEC (Leuven, Belgium). These two facilities employed very different engagement models when we were selecting our development partner. SEMATECH&#8217;s business model at that time required a significant upfront membership fee in order to do even the most preliminary of work. These fees were cost prohibitive for a startup of our size and level of funding at that time. In comparison, IMEC proactively approached us with creative ways to engage in zero dollar (free to us) Joint Development Projects (JDP) and we continued working under this arrangement for a full four years before we executed our first paid JDP with IMEC. Since 2014 we have maintained a team of assignees who work onsite at IMEC and perform critical work to test and analyze our products on these tools.</p></blockquote><h3>Conclusion:</h3><p>The biggest US semiconductor supply chain risk is that the ~$50 billion soon to be appropriated for the CHIPS Act gets spent on building factories that make today&#8217;s semiconductors and fail to invent tomorrow&#8217;s future. Its always harder to come up with solutions than point out problems. This RFI from BIS illustrates this point clearly: commenters had lots of ideas about what is wrong, and far fewer ideas about how to fix it. Any effort to increase US semiconductor supply chain resilience has to propose ways that change firm behavior: from establishing a microelectronics commons to provide no-cost JDPs to building a new heavy ion cyclotron, the government needs policies that buy-down risk in ways that favorably re-align commercial incentives.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[From TSMC to Tungsten: Semiconductor Supply Chain Risks]]></title><description><![CDATA[Part one of a two-part series on supply chains]]></description><link>https://semiliterate.substack.com/p/from-tsmc-to-tungsten-semiconductor</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://semiliterate.substack.com/p/from-tsmc-to-tungsten-semiconductor</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Semi-Literate]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 03 May 2021 23:30:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4f29474c-a509-4164-acb1-e3131e169632_372x279.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Welcome to SemiLiterate, a guide to the chip industry through the lens of public policy.

This post talks about the interesting ones.</p><p>The semiconductor supply chain is expansive, expensive, and full of <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2021-0011-0080">chokepoints</a>. </p><blockquote><p>Depending on the specific product, there are 400 to 1,400 steps in the overall manufacturing process of semiconductor wafers. The average time to fabricate semiconductor wafers is about 12 weeks, but it can take up to 14-20 weeks.</p><p>A state-of-the-art semiconductor fab of standard capacity requires roughly $5 billion - $20 billion of CapEx, including land, building, and equipment. This is significantly higher than, for example, the estimated cost of a next-generation aircraft carrier ($13 billion) or a new nuclear power plant ($4 billion to $8 billion.</p><p>The ambient outdoor air in a typical urban area contains 35,000,000 particles of 0.5 micron or bigger in size for each cubic meter, while a semiconductor manufacturing cleanroom permits absolutely zero particles of that size&#8230;</p><p>There are more than 50 points across the overall supply chain where a single region accounts for 65% or more of the total global supply&#8230;</p></blockquote><p>This regional concentration causes heartburn for policymakers in the US and Europe who are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/01/white-house-studying-supply-chain-stress-tests-after-semiconductor-shortages-sources-say-.html">keenly </a><a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/europe-weighs-semiconductor-foundry-to-fix-supply-chain-risk">interested </a>in diversifying advanced semiconductor fabrication beyond East Asia.</p><h3>Background: Who is in this Supply Chain</h3><p>The semiconductor supply chain is poorly defined and poorly understood. So, before getting in to this post, I want to use a metaphor I&#8217;ve previously introduced to explain at a basic level the structure of the semiconductor supply chain: baking a cake. </p><blockquote><p>Think of making a chip like baking a cake. You get out a recipe book, find the right page, pre-heat the oven, mix baking powder, flour, eggs, &amp; sugar in a bowl, pour the batter in a pan, put that pan in the oven, and then pull it out when its done. </p></blockquote><p>I like using the graphic below from the <a href="https://www.piie.com/sites/default/files/documents/wp20-16.pdf">Peterson Institute for International Economics</a> to illustrate all the different parts of the semiconductor supply chain.

What is unique about the comments BIS received is how they reveal everyone should be just as concerned about the providers of eggs, flour, and sugar. </p><p>The rest of this post will focus on understanding and identifying risks to U.S. semiconductor production in tandem with the risks stemming from the entity that is producing or providing the product.</p><h3>Tiers of Supply Chain Risk: TSMC to Tungsten</h3><p>The most concerning risks in any supply chain are sole and single source suppliers. &#8220;Sole source&#8221; refers to products/services for which there is literally only one supplier of the item/service whereas &#8220;single source&#8221; means a particular supplier is purposefully chosen by the buying organization, though there may be other suppliers who are available that for one reason or another (qualification time, cost) are not used. </p><p>The current conversation around semiconductor supply chain security is obsessively focused on one company (TSMC) in one country (Taiwan) because it has 92% of the world&#8217;s sub-10nm chip manufacturing. TSMC is a <em>sole source</em> supplier of 5nm semi manufacturing services and a <em>single source</em> supplier for some &gt;5nm chips. There are other contract manufacturers of slightly less advanced chips in the world (ex. Samsung) but many fabless companies use TSMC as their <em>single source</em> of these contract manufacturing services. TSMC is incredibly important. But, there are supply chain risks to TSMC that are just as concerning as the global reliance on TSMC itself.</p><p>Sticking with the TSMC example, one might think of the supply chain risks in tiers:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Tier 1 risk</strong>: TSMC is the sole source of advanced logic chip production.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tier 2 risk</strong>: TSMC relies on a sole source Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV) tool from ASML (Netherlands) for its advanced logic production.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tier 3 risk</strong>: ASML relies on its <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2020/02/29/how-asml-became-chipmakings-biggest-monopoly">5000 suppliers</a>, some of whom are single source, to provide components for its EUV machine.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tier 4 risk</strong>: All lithography tools rely on rare gases and specialty materials from single or sole source suppliers (ex. Linde, Carl Zeiss, Wonik).</p></li><li><p><strong>Tier 5 risk</strong>: Rare gas suppliers rely on steel factories in Ukraine and China to supply 80% or more of rare gases used in the semiconductor industry. Production of these gases is dependent on Air Separation Units (ASUs) at these factories.</p></li></ul><p><strong>To tie tiers 1 to 5</strong>: TSMC&#8217;s advanced logic chip production relies on single and sole source gases from steel plants in Ukraine and China. That is a company-level risk. But it is also an industry-level risk because (presumably) all the other major semiconductor companies rely on a handful of companies for rare gas supplies (who presumably don&#8217;t only sell to chip factories), which are in turn largely derived from steel factory operations in two countries. This is not abstract. Conflict in Ukraine in 2015 <a href="https://electronics360.globalspec.com/article/5742/neon-gas-skyrockets-ukraine-or-china">interrupted supply</a> of Neon gas used in fabs for weeks, raising prices 500%.</p><p>Tier 1-5 risks like this exist in many of the 400-1400 steps required to process a wafer. This example of supply chain risk tiers also highlights several things:</p><ul><li><p>There are product-specific, company-specific, country-specific risks.</p></li><li><p>Risks are more easily defined (and mitigated) at the Tier 1 and Tier 2 levels. These are the risks you read about in the news.</p></li><li><p>Tier 3-5 risks are difficult to identify, costly to mitigate, and require greater strategic thinking. (Should a chip factory build a steel factory just to vertically integrate its supply of rare gases? (No.))</p></li></ul><h3>What the Comments Say:</h3><p>Comments were submitted by a huge cast of characters, reflecting this industry&#8217;s breadth. <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2021-0011-0095">Semiconductor companies</a> and the industry associations that represent them, <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2021-0011-0094">universities</a>, <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2021-0011-0027">think tanks</a>, <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2021-0011-0062">Manufacturing USA consortia</a>, the <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2021-0011-0087">National Mining Association</a>, the <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2021-0011-0055">Motor Equipment Manufacturing</a> institute, <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2021-0011-0013">Taiwanese </a>chemical suppliers, the <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2021-0011-0067">American Chemical Council</a>, and <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2021-0011-0084">Amazon</a>.</p><p>The easiest way to think about risks to the semiconductor supply chain is by breaking them down in to the chip production process steps each risk implicates (from <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2021-0011-0080">SIA</a>):</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03789a06-98fa-4c24-b9a8-14e2060a7aac_589x263.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03789a06-98fa-4c24-b9a8-14e2060a7aac_589x263.png" width="589" height="263" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/03789a06-98fa-4c24-b9a8-14e2060a7aac_589x263.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:263,&quot;width&quot;:589,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:65371,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03789a06-98fa-4c24-b9a8-14e2060a7aac_589x263.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03789a06-98fa-4c24-b9a8-14e2060a7aac_589x263.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03789a06-98fa-4c24-b9a8-14e2060a7aac_589x263.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03789a06-98fa-4c24-b9a8-14e2060a7aac_589x263.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>The U.S. semiconductor supply chain is leading when it comes to (non-DRAM) design, EDA, and equipment.

Lets use a chemical commonly used in semiconductor manufacturing as an example: ammonium paratungstate (APT). Quoting from one of the comments to BIS:</p><blockquote><p>"80% of the world's tungsten mineral (APT, ammonium paratungstate) comes from China. APT is used to make tungsten hexafluoride (WF6) and tungsten (W) sputter targets. WF6 is used for the majority of all semiconductor devices. China represents about 80% of the mining production, with 95% of supply controlled by one company. There are reportedly new mining sources in Vietnam and possibly in South Korea. </p><p>There is only one WF6 manufacturing site in the U.S. owned by Japanese company. This site has no expansion capability and would need high investment to build additional plant capacity. </p></blockquote><p>That seems like a very serious semiconductor supply chain risk:</p><p><strong>Tier 1 Risk</strong>: Company B makes chips for Company A</p><p><strong>Tier 2 Risk</strong>: Company B buys equipment from Company C</p><p><strong>Tier 3 Risk</strong>: Company C&#8217;s equipment relies on WF6</p><p><strong>Tier 4 Risk</strong>: WF6 is sole sourced by Company B from Company D&#8217;s US factory</p><p><strong>Tier 5 Risk</strong>: Company D buys most of its APT from China</p><p>The conversation around semi supply chain security is currently focused on making sure Company B continues to make chips for Company A. But there are myriad deeper risks here, and its not clear whose job it is to mitigate these risks. We&#8217;re going to focus on just diagnosing the problem: this product&#8217;s supply chain dependence on China. </p><p>The first step is identifying the Harmonized Schedule code for the product you&#8217;re worried about. There are a couple different ways you could do this using official resources (like the <a href="https://dataweb.usitc.gov/classification/commodity-description/HTS/2">USITC&#8217;s Commodity Description Look Up</a>) but honestly just Google &#8220;ammonium paratungstate HS code&#8221; and it will get you there. Look for the 6-digit version and you&#8217;ll find: HS 2841.80&nbsp;Metallic &#8220;Tungstates (Wolframates).&#8221; This isn&#8217;t <em>exactly </em>ammonium paratungstate, but it gets us started in the right direction.</p><p>Now take your HS code and plug it in to the Organization of Economic Complexity&#8217;s <a href="https://oec.world/">website</a>. Scroll down to the data visualization section and you&#8217;ll get a lot of pretty charts.

Not exactly the 80% that the BIS commenter stated. </p><p>Lets dig deeper. International trade data is all harmonized at the 6-digit level (thus the &#8220;<em>Harmonized</em>&#8221; Schedule) but if you look at U.S. imports or exports specifically you can get even more granular data from the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). In this case, you can go to <a href="https://hts.usitc.gov/view/Chapter%2028?release=2020HTSARev7">Chapter 28 of the HTSUS</a> and check to see if there are any codes related to APT at the 8 or 10-digit level. Lucky for us, when you do so, you find HTS 2841.80.00.10 &#8220;Tungstates (Wolframates) of ammonium.&#8221; Bingo.</p><p>Going now to the <a href="https://dataweb.usitc.gov/">USITC&#8217;s DataWeb tool</a> and looking at Imports for Consumption, pull charts for US Imports from China and US Imports from the World for 2010-20. Then, cross walk the numbers to get US Imports from China as a Percent of US Imports from the World for HTS 2841.80.00.10 from 2010-20.

But, it looks like there may be some suppliers in Germany, Japan, and Vietnam active in the last 5 years (note: Vietnam has a notorious delay in its trade data reporting - it likely has exports for 2019 and 2020). A quick search reveals a Japanese <a href="http://www.jnm.co.jp/en/products/ammonium_salt.html">supplier </a>affiliated with Mitsubishi Materials Group and a Vietnamese <a href="https://roskill.com/news/tungsten-h-c-starck-sells-stake-in-vietnamese-chemicals-jv/">supplier </a>affiliated with Masan Resources. And it looks like the two entities <a href="https://roskill.com/news/tungsten-masan-high-tech-agrees-strategic-alliance-with-mitsubishi-materials/">signed </a>a strategic cooperation agreement in late 2020. If I&#8217;m a semiconductor company looking to diversify my supply chain, that is all I need to start qualifying a new supplier.

As a result, automotive companies reduced their orders for chips with their contract chip manufacturers (&#8220;foundries&#8221;). In turn, these foundries, which now had unexpected capacity they needed to fill, sought new business and orders to fill their factories&#8217; excess capacity. They re-tooled their automotive chip factory lines so they could take orders from consumer electronics chipmakers like Nvidia, which makes the graphics processing unit (GPU) chips found in the sorts of video game systems that saw a tremendous spike in demand while everyone was home during the pandemic. </p><p>However, the automotive industry&#8217;s assumption proved incorrect, and demand for cars shot up in the second half of 2020. The automotive manufacturers, caught off-guard by this increase in demand, went back to their foundries and attempted to place orders for automotive chips, only to be told the factories were at capacity.</p><p>Careful observers of this industry noticed as early as last fall that foundry quotes were going through the roof. If you are anywhere in the foundry business, you&#8217;re going to have a <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20201124PD200.html">fantastic</a> 2021: </p><blockquote><p>Pure-play foundries including Globalfoundries, United Microelectronics (UMC) and Vanguard International Semiconductor (VIS) have raised 8-inch foundry quotes by 10-15% in the fourth quarter, with the quotes set to rise by another 20-40%.</p></blockquote><h3>How it Got Worse</h3><p>Note that the &#8220;8-inch foundry quotes&#8221; referred to in the previous paragraph are for factories that operate 8-inch (or 200mm) wafer manufacturing processes. 200mm wafers are a smaller/older size of wafer frequently used to manufacture chips for automotive end uses that, while advanced, are not state of the art. State of the art chips are manufactured on 300mm (12-inch) wafers to take advantage of economies of scale. Chips made on 300mm wafers are mainly high-margin chips destined for consumer electronics end uses (think Apple Watches and Playstation 5s). </p><p>Put yourselves in the shoes of a foundry that makes automotive chips: you have a 200mm wafer line that usually makes low-margin automotive chips. Its a good, consistent business. And then a global pandemic happens and your main automotive customers cancel their orders. Major problem. But, in a stunning turn of events, you get approached soon thereafter by a consumer electronics chipmaker who is desperate to make more chips for Playstation 5s in 2020 <em>and </em>they are willing to pay a premium to compensate you for the trouble of re-tooling your factory line to make their chips (a costly process that can take months). The worst year ever has just turned in to the best year ever. But then, your old automotive customers come knocking asking if they can re-place their orders, just as you&#8217;ve finished the expensive task of re-tooling your factory for Playstation 5 chips. What do you do? You make the Playstation 5 chips, of course. </p><p>So the automotive industry was faced with a shortage of available factory capacity to make the chips they need. This shortage was exacerbated by several incredibly unlucky events:</p><ul><li><p>a February 2020 <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/texas-winter-storm-strikes-chip-makers-compounding-supply-woes-11613588617">power grid failure</a> in Texas that shut down SamsungFoundry, NXP, and Infineon chip factories. SamsungFoundry makes Tesla&#8217;s chips, while NXP and Infineon are the #1 and #2 automotive chip makers in the world.</p></li><li><p>a March 2020 <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-renesas-idUSKBN2BW015">fire </a>at a Renesas factory in Japan which partially destroyed its clean room, stopping chip production there <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-renesas-idUSKBN2BW015">until June</a>. This halt is <a href="https://www.cleanroomtechnology.com/news/article_page/Fire_destroys_5_of_Renesas_semiconductor_cleanroom/175477">costing Renesas</a> ~$156 million/month. Renesas is the #3 automotive chipmaker in the world.</p></li></ul><p>I feel like this point bears highlighting: the #1, #2, and #3 largest suppliers of automotive chips in the world all had black swan events shut down factories in early 2021 at a time when their production was already maxed out.</p><h3>Who is Hurting</h3><p>The largest end use markets for semiconductors are computers and consumer, industrial, and communications equipment, which collectively consume over 85 percent of all semiconductors.

To put all this in plain English: automakers in Europe (VW, BMW, Mercedes, Fiat) and Japan (Toyota, Suzuki, Mitsubishi) lead automakers in the U.S. (GM, Ford, Chrysler) when it comes to building cars that are hybrid, electric, and/or rich in navigation/infotainment systems. This is a good thing so long as the chip supply chains on which all of these features rely is healthy. Consumers love all the new features coming from Japanese and European cars. But when a supply chain crunch happens, these European and Japanese automakers are all the sudden even more exposed than their U.S. competitors. </p><p>Analysts are saying this shortage will linger through the first half of 2021 and result in 700,000 fewer new vehicles in Q1 2021. One <a href="https://www.axios.com/chip-shortage-automakers-0b2f78d4-e178-4e97-8669-83820c5fe029.html">report</a> estimates it will cost the auto industry $61 billion. However, these supply chain constraints will disproportionately affect Japanese and European automakers and their production delays will likely extend beyond those of American automakers.</p><h3>What to Do About It</h3><p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/09/white-house-semiconductor-shortage-chips-autos/">news </a>that the White House is hosting a summit this week with chipmakers is welcome, but no one should expect any breakthroughs. In addition to the basic fact that it takes 60-90 days to make a chip and that building a new factory takes 12-18 months, there are several other specific factors that mean there is simply no way the government (any government) can be reasonably expected to help resolve the problem in the short term:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Automotive Chips Take Time</strong>: we&#8217;ve all had the experience of our smartphone unexpectedly shutting down or freezing.

During this six-month qualification time, the chips are subject to stress tests of 2,000 hours, where a chip is exposed to higher voltages and temperatures than its rated specifications. Even after meeting these stringent performance requirements, the chips will be further tested by the OEM at the system (automobile) level, making the entire process take well over one year.</p></li></ul><h4>Government Solutions:</h4><p>The hard truth is there are no government (policy) solutions to this supply chain crunch in the short term. The German government can <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-taiwan-autos-chips-idUKKBN29T04O">encourage </a>TSMC to produce more automotive chips all it wants, but the whole chip industry is basically operating at capacity.

Because of the long qualification time and high quality expected, demand for automotive chips are more &#8220;sticky&#8221; than standard consumer electronic chips. In general, auto OEMs maintain the same sourcing throughout the model run of a vehicle (approximately 5 years) and consider new suppliers only when they are launching new models. Auto OEMs are likely to be repeat customers of companies and brands that they have previously qualified both for use in existing vehicles as well as future models, given the expectation that the supplier supports their product for the lifetime of a given vehicle. U.S. headquartered semiconductor firms that are qualified suppliers for automakers will benefit from this stickiness, customer loyalty, and reputation for quality.   </p><h4>Follow the Silicon: All Eyes on Malaysia</h4><p>If you&#8217;ve made it this far in the post, well done. Bear with me here because this is about to get even more geeky: I am going to argue that we should interpret Malaysia&#8217;s exports of integrated circuits as a bellwether for the chip supply chain crunch easing.</p><p>So, the production of semiconductors occurs in three distinct stages: design, manufacturing, and assembly, test, &amp; packaging (ATP). Though ATP providers only account for 10% of a chip&#8217;s value, because they are the final step in semiconductor production, the export of the finished good registers the full value of the good against the balance of trade with a given country, even in countries where the design and/or manufacture of that chip (and thus 45-90% of its value) may have originated. Because of the high concentration of ATP facilities in Southeast Asia (due to low labor costs), U.S. trade data reports a significant bilateral trade deficit with select SE Asian countries for trade in semiconductors:  </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe650da9e-78be-4c98-ba68-5fbded07ff94_485x303.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe650da9e-78be-4c98-ba68-5fbded07ff94_485x303.png" width="485" height="303" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e650da9e-78be-4c98-ba68-5fbded07ff94_485x303.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:303,&quot;width&quot;:485,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:30877,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe650da9e-78be-4c98-ba68-5fbded07ff94_485x303.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe650da9e-78be-4c98-ba68-5fbded07ff94_485x303.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe650da9e-78be-4c98-ba68-5fbded07ff94_485x303.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe650da9e-78be-4c98-ba68-5fbded07ff94_485x303.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Source: <a href="https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/executive_briefings/ebot-semiconductor_gvc_final.pdf">USITC paper</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>U.S. imports from SE Asia of semiconductors are comprised of products that already contain significant U.S. value. U.S. semiconductor firms often import their own products after the ATP process for warehousing or sales purposes. U.S. manufacturers of products that incorporate semiconductors (such as computers or automobiles) also import a significant portion of products, which include U.S. added value, directly from overseas.  </p><p>For example, a company like Texas Instruments might design and manufacture a $10 automotive chip in Richardson, TX but then send that chip to a test facility in Malaysia, when $9 of the value is &#8220;built in,&#8221; for ATP. Then when that chip is exported from Malaysia back to the U.S. so Ford can put it on a printed circuit board behind the dashboard of an F-150, the value of that export is registered as a $10 chip, even though Malaysia only added $1 of the value. </p><p>This part of the semiconductor global value chain leads to some funny trade statistics, especially when you consider that Malaysia doesn&#8217;t have many semiconductor factories but it has many many many more semiconductor ATP facilities. </p><h4>Malaysia: Semiconductor Production vs. Semiconductor ATP</h4><p>There are different kinds of &#8220;exports&#8221; recorded by international trade statistics. </p><ul><li><p>Domestic Exports refer to commodities grown, produced or manufactured in a country. </p><ul><li><p>Malaysia&#8217;s <em>Domestic Exports</em> of chips was ~$29 billion in 2020.</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p>Total Exports refer to the total physical movement of merchandise out of a country to another country.</p><ul><li><p>Malaysia&#8217;s <em>Total Exports</em> of chips was ~$50 billion in 2020.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>So there was roughly a $21 billion gap between the value of chips domestically produced-and-then exported vs. the value of all chips exported from Malaysia in 2020. That $21 billion gap is the value of all the chips that were sent to Malaysia for ATP before being re-exported for end use (automotive, communications, etc).</p><p>The vast majority of chips that are made in semiconductor factories in Malaysia are made by the big automotive chip companies: ON Semiconductor and Infineon both have semiconductor factories in-country. But, in addition to this domestic production (which again, when exported, would count towards the Domestic Exports total), Malaysia also is home to ATP facilities used by nearly every automotive chip maker AND the foundries that are being asked to ramp up production in response to the chip shortage. </p><p>So what we should expect is that Malaysia&#8217;s exports of chips (both Domestic Exports and Total Exports) are spiking right now as auto chipmakers and foundries increase production and send those chips to Malaysia for ATP. But we&#8217;re not seeing that. </p><p>In fact, when one looks at the monthly trade data provided by the Malaysian government on its (surprisingly user-friendly) <a href="https://metsonline.dosm.gov.my/">trade data website</a> we find that Malaysian Total Exports of chips sharply declined in January and February of 2021 (the light blue line in the chart below). </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff790ea60-8cd3-4958-b1d2-06ce513cd08c_483x289.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff790ea60-8cd3-4958-b1d2-06ce513cd08c_483x289.png" width="483" height="289" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f790ea60-8cd3-4958-b1d2-06ce513cd08c_483x289.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:289,&quot;width&quot;:483,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:22852,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff790ea60-8cd3-4958-b1d2-06ce513cd08c_483x289.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff790ea60-8cd3-4958-b1d2-06ce513cd08c_483x289.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff790ea60-8cd3-4958-b1d2-06ce513cd08c_483x289.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff790ea60-8cd3-4958-b1d2-06ce513cd08c_483x289.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Monthly exports of Integrated Circuits (HS 8542) from Malaysia, 2017-21.

That is not good news if you are an automotive company, but note that it reflects the trend line in previous years of declines in exports during January/February. Once that trend line starts to tick up we will know we&#8217;re starting to see an actual easing of this chip supply chain crunch. Until then, there is not much policymakers can do except wait for Malaysia&#8217;s March 2021 trade data release.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>the views here are my own and drawn solely from the documents I cite here.</em></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reviewing a Month of Big Deals in the Chip Industry]]></title><description><![CDATA[IntelFoundry, the M1, AMAT M&A, NSCAI recs, and Supply Chain Re-shoring]]></description><link>https://semiliterate.substack.com/p/reviewing-a-month-of-big-deals-in</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://semiliterate.substack.com/p/reviewing-a-month-of-big-deals-in</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Semi-Literate]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 04 Apr 2021 14:59:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cc79fd3-8474-453b-bce3-23ebc2d56b0a_1000x500.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Welcome to SemiLiterate, a guide to the semiconductor industry through the lens of public policy.

IntelFoundry and its Implications</h3><p>The announcement that Intel is getting back in to the contract manufacturing business via <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/intel-foundry-services.html">IntelFoundry</a> is a big deal. These will be the first 300mm wafer lines built in the U.S. in about ~10 years (or whenever it was that GlobalFoundries finished building out its Malta, NY facility) and Intel&#8217;s announcement dovetails nicely with the current administration&#8217;s focus on re-shoring semiconductor supply chains. It also (1) signals the end of Nikon&#8217;s attempts to develop Argon Fluoride immersion (ArFi) lithography as a viable competitor to ASML&#8217;s extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV). And (2) it basically was one big mea culpa: Intel admitted it was wrong and its struggles with 10 and 7nm are ongoing while also tacitly admitting TSMC owns the 2020s for the chip industry. I&#8217;m not going to write up Intel&#8217;s announcement in great detail but will address #1 and #2 briefly below. Everyone should just read Ben Thompson&#8217;s (excellent, free, comprehensive) <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/intel-unleashed-gelsinger-on-intel-idm-2-0/">summary</a>. With that said, here is how <a href="https://semiliterate.substack.com/p/what-to-do-about-intel">Semi-Literate characterized Intel&#8217;s options</a> last fall:</p><blockquote><p>Intel is a large successful commercial firm that is large and successful due to its focus on commercially popular electronics, not government priorities. Intel will need to do more than create a leading edge foundry using US government money and purchase commitments if it is going to catch up with TSMC and Samsung.</p></blockquote><p>Intel is doing just that: spending $20 billion to build a commercially-focused leading edge foundry business is a great start. While this is a surprise, Intel has been testing the idea in public for a while going so far as having the CEO send a letter to the Pentagon&nbsp;<a href="https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/intel%20letter.pdf">saying</a>&nbsp;&#8220;we want to make a foundry&#8221; in April 2020. $20 billion sounds like a lot, but <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/TSMC-hikes-capex-to-record-28bn-as-chip-race-heats-up">TSMC&#8217;s CapEx</a> for 2021 is supposed to be around $28 billion. Its going to be an uphill battle. Intel&#8217;s announcement will have two interesting follow-on effects for the chip industry:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Leading edge lithography belongs to ASML</strong>. Intel is all-in on ASML and EUV, meaning Nikon is out of the leading edge lithography game: Nikon&#8217;s ArFi lithography system (which is what Intel went with for 10nm and 7nm, thus all the delays) is done. Expect some interesting M&amp;A activity around Nikon in the next year or two, possibly as Nikon tries to recoup some of its losses via sales of components to nascent Chinese SME firms. China remains locked out of purchases of EUV lithography so DUV is the best it can hope for (see #4 below).</p></li><li><p><strong>The 2020s belong to TSMC: </strong>Intel wont have 7nm processors to market until 2023. We&#8217;re still in H1 of 2021 and Intel was originally supposed to have 7nm out in late 2019 or early 2020. In effect this means IntelFoundry&#8217;s competitors (TSMC and Samsung Foundry) will enjoy at least 5+ years lead on IntelFoundry as both have been producing commercial volumes of 7nm chips since Spring 2018. This lead will be all the more lucrative for TSMC because it gives them time to further lock in customers like Apple, who are currently using TSMC&#8217;s most advanced process node (5nm) for their state of the art system on chip (SoC):</p></li></ol><h3>2. Apple Silicon and the Vertical Integration of Big Tech</h3><p>The second big deal this month is the ridiculously good reviews Apple&#8217;s M1 chip continues to get. With this chip, Apple Silicon has officially entered the top tier of fabless companies. To put that another way: A company primarily known for its consumer electronics has built an in-house silicon design shop whose performance now exceeds that of Fortune 500 companies whose <em>only job</em> is chip design. </p><p>Apple buys as much of TSMC&#8217;s 5nm capacity as it can, using at least some of it to fabricate its M1 SoCs (think of an SoC as &#8220;a chip of chips&#8221;). Everyone said the M1 was <a href="https://debugger.medium.com/why-is-apples-m1-chip-so-fast-3262b158cba2">absolutely outstanding</a> when it was released in 2020, but we&#8217;re only now realizing how good: Adobe <a href="https://thenextweb.com/plugged/2021/03/11/adobe-officially-releases-photoshop-for-apple-m1-says-its-50-faster/">says</a> Photoshop runs 50% faster on a Macbook with an M1 as opposed to a Macbook with an Intel CPU. A fifty percent (!) improvement. The M1 is also the worst chip Apple will release in the next decade: Apple Silicon will continue to iterate and get better with each generation just like Apple&#8217;s consumer electronics have for 10+ years. But Apple is going to iterate using TSMC, not Intel.</p><p>Every one of Apple&#8217;s fabless suppliers and competitors should be watching M1 news like a hawk. The introduction of this chip will be remembered as the start of a new age in which Big Tech began producing chips as good, or better, than fabless firms.  Apple&#8217;s long term goal here is to achieve performance advantages, design-out its traditional chip suppliers, and eventually realize cost savings. Every tech industry company wants a hardware lead who can accomplish what <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-johny-srouji-apple-chief-chipmaker/">Johny Srouji</a> has (that link is a fantastic profile, by the way), but it takes time: he&#8217;s been with Apple since 2008. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook are all investing heavily in chip design but really only began doing so in the past 5 years, so any notable chip products wont roll out until the mid-2020s (Google&#8217;s TPU being a notable exception).</p><h3>3. Chinese Anti-Trust Concerns Nix Applied Materials Acquisition (the trade wars continue)</h3><p>This <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2BL1I4">headline</a> from March 29th says it all:</p><blockquote><p>Applied Materials has terminated its $2.2-billion deal to buy Japanese peer Kokusai Electric Corp from KKR &amp; Co, the chip equipment maker said on Monday as it did not get a confirmation of timely approval from China&#8217;s regulator.</p></blockquote><p>The precedent for big mergers and acquisitions in the chip industry is pretty well-established: Flashy announcement followed by a regulatory mess as companies try to seek anti-trust approval from governments around the world. Applied Materials is now 0/2 in attempted acquisitions of Japanese semiconductor manufacturing equipment firms (they <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2015/04/27/applied-materials-calls-off-its-merger-with-tokyo-electron-due-to-regulatory-snag/">attempted to buy Tokyo Electron in 2015</a>). That 2015 deal fell apart due to (probably well-founded) U.S. anti-trust concerns but China&#8217; decision here will reverberate much longer. This is the equivalent of Boeing trying to buy Brazil&#8217;s Embraer and France stepping in to say &#8220;nope.&#8221; Interestingly, China did approve the Marvell-Inphi tie up this past week. So maybe just mergers in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry are verboten now that China realizes it needs to do everything possible to protect and promote its domestic chip manufacturing equipment firms? China <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nxp-semicondtrs-m-a-qualcomm/qualcomm-ends-44-billion-nxp-bid-after-failing-to-win-china-approval-idUSKBN1KF193">nixed</a> the NXP-Qualcomm deal in 2018, but this is different.</p><p>There are three major pending M&amp;A deals that will need Chinese regulatory approval, and the prospects aren&#8217;t looking great for #1 and #2:</p><ul><li><p><strong>AMD-Xilinx</strong>: this echoes the Intel-Altera tie up (Altera, like Xilinx, makes FPGA chips and AMD, like Intel, uses the x86 architecture). Intel-Altera was announced June 2015 and closed December 2015. AMD-Xilinx was announced October 2020 so if no progress is announced in April it could be a sign of trouble.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Nvidia-Arm</strong>: Announced September 2020... this deal seems exceedingly unlikely to secure regulatory approval, even absent Chinese intervention.

Arm is simply too ubiquitous in the industry for Nvidia&#8217;s competitors to allow it to control that much IP.

The primary means by which the NSCAI recommended the U.S. keep China two generations behind the leading edge is through export controls on Deep Ultraviolet Lithography (DUV) equipment. But this equipment is only made by two companies in the world, and one is in The Netherlands (ASML) and one is in Japan (Nikon). So this recommendation will require some diplomacy to execute.</p><p>This recommendation&#8217;s timing was also a bit ironic because the same week the NSCAI final report was released, ASML <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asml-holding-smic/asml-extends-sales-deal-with-chinese-chipmaker-smic-to-end-of-2021-idUSKBN2AV1S6">extended</a> its $1.2 billion dollar sales relationship with SMIC (China&#8217;s leading foundry, and a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/12/22/2020-28031/addition-of-entities-to-the-entity-list-revision-of-entry-on-the-entity-list-and-removal-of-entities">U.S. Entity Listed</a> firm as of December 2020) to sell Deep Ultraviolet Lithography (DUV) equipment through the end of 2021. But DUV has been in China for a while. Notably, SK Hynix <a href="http://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=27908">announced</a> it was brining DUV to its China factory in 2019. Nikon also has <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4415477-three-headwinds-facing-asml-s-non-euv-business-in-china">sold</a> its DUV tools to China in the past as its chipmaking equipment business <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Nikon-plans-reform-to-reduce-reliance-on-key-customer-Intel">continues</a> to struggle. </p><p>So it would appear that there is already substantial foreign availability of DUV equipment in China, making any new controls likely too late. The Bureau of Industry and Security&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/office-of-technology-evaluation-ote/foreign-availability-assesments#:~:text=Foreign%20availability%20exists%20for%20a,item%20would%20be%20rendered%20ineffective.">guidance</a> on foreign availability is pretty clear:</p><blockquote><p>Foreign availability exists for a national-security controlled item when a non-U.S. origin item of comparable quality is foreign available, and in sufficient quantities, such that the U.S. export controls on that item would be rendered ineffective.</p></blockquote><p>In addition to this foreign availability, Chinese firms are trying to buy and build their way in to the DUV lithography market. Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE) will be a name to watch in 2021 and beyond as they represent China&#8217;s best shot at developing an indigenous DUV tool. No doubt they are trying to buy lithography components from Nikon to advance their efforts.</p><p>With that said, this was a great report by NSCAI and it accomplished a rare feat by government report standards: in addition to diagnosing problems it actually managed to prescribe tangible solutions. The NSCAI chapter on microelectronics is genuinely <a href="https://reports.nscai.gov/final-report/chapter-13/">quite good</a>. And for those who think otherwise, at least it offered something to argue with rather than platitudes. </p><h3>5. Re-shoring Semiconductor Supply Chains</h3><h4>Re-shoring American Chip Supply Chains:</h4><p>The recent Biden Administration supply chain executive order specifically <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-to-address-chip-shortages-supply-chain-problems-with-executive-action-11614160803">called out</a> chip supply chains as an area of concern, and The Commerce Department&#8217;s Federal Register <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/03/15/2021-05353/risks-in-the-semiconductor-manufacturing-and-advanced-packaging-supply-chain">notice</a> seeking comment on semiconductor supply chain risks is pretty interesting (as far as FR RFIs go). Commerce is hosting an open <a href="https://www.bis.doc.gov/semiconductorforum">virtual forum</a> on semiconductor supply chains in early April. On top of the IntelFoundry announcement and <a href="https://semiliterate.substack.com/p/the-chips-act-microelectronics-and">The CHIPS Act</a> passage in January 2020, this political momentum comes after several favorable developments for the domestic US chip industry: </p><ul><li><p>TSMC has broken ground in Arizona on a 5nm fab coming on line in 2024 and is in the midst of <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Taiwan-s-TSMC-begins-hiring-blitz-for-12bn-US-plant">a hiring blitz</a>. <a href="https://wccftech.com/tsmc-rumored-to-build-35-billion-5nm-plant-in-the-u-s-with-100k-month-wafer-output/">Rumors</a> of a mega fab valued at $35 billion abound.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16483/samsung-in-the-usa-a-17-billion-usd-fab-by-late-2023">Samsung</a> is building a 3nm factory in Texas. $17 billion potentially. </p></li><li><p>Micron is <a href="https://www.eetimes.com/micron-to-invest-3-billion-in-virginia-fab-expansion/">building out</a> their fab in Manassas (which mainly does long life cycle/automotive chips) to expand capacity and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/micron-western-digital-looking-at-possible-deal-for-chip-maker-kioxia-11617229660">considering a bid</a> for Japan&#8217;s Kioxia (formerly Toshiba Memory).</p></li><li><p>GlobalFoundries has been oddly silent to this point. Expect an announcement sooner rather than later, probably when the CHIPS Act is funded by Congress.</p></li></ul><h4>Re-shoring European Chip Supply Chains:</h4><p>Meanwhile Europe <a href="https://www.eenewseurope.com/news/145bn-boost-europes-semiconductor-industry/page/0/1">announced</a> a $145 billion fund to shore-up European competitiveness in chips and Europe is <a href="https://europe.autonews.com/suppliers/eu-weighs-deal-tsmc-samsung-microchip-foundry">courting</a> Samsung and/or TSMC to build a new chip factory in the region. TSMC went on the record in the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/05206915-fd73-4a3a-92a5-6760ce965bd9">Financial Times</a> last week to say &#8220;thanks but no thanks:&#8221;</p><blockquote><p>In the US, we committed to building a fab after the authorities made clear that they would subsidize the cost gap. In Japan, our investment is focused on an area of technology that is key to our future,&#8221; says a senior TSMC executive. &#8220;But <em>in Europe, the case is not that strong, and [the Europeans] really should figure out what exactly it is they want, and whether they can maybe achieve it with their own chipmakers</em>.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>This is smart by TSMC. The value proposition of an advanced chip fab in Europe seems odd given how far behind the rest of the world the European chip industry currently sits. The crown jewels of the EU chip manufacturing industry (Infineon, NXP, and STMicro) don&#8217;t do (and don&#8217;t need to do) leading edge chip manufacturing and most major consumers of chips in Europe (Nokia, Ericsson, VW, BMW etc) don&#8217;t need the most advanced chips for their products. This $145 billion fund seems like an expensive vanity project with uncertain return on investment. </p><p>It will however be a boon for whichever company/companies benefit from these funds. Europe should probably give all the money to IMEC in Belgium, encourage them to establish some consortium with TSMC to accelerate &#8220;beyond&#8221; EUV research, and re-tool the GlobalFoundries fab in Dresden and ST Micro&#8217;s in France, and call it a day. Interestingly, Intel did make clear its factory in Ireland will get some of the IntelFoundry investment. And Apple recently <a href="https://europe.autonews.com/technology/apple-open-semiconductor-center-germany">announced</a> a $1.2 billion chip design center in Germany. So maybe Europe will be able to claim victory after all.</p><h3>Conclusion (other big deals)</h3><p>Just as important as these five subjects are some things that didnt make the cut:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.icinsights.com/news/bulletins/Samsung-And-TSMC-Seeking-To-Spend-Their-Way-To-Worldwide-Domination-Of-Advanced-IC-Technology/">TSMC and Samsung are 43% of whole industry&#8217;s CapEx</a>: Between 2017 and 2020 Samsung spent $93.2 billion on chip CapEx, more than double the $44.7 billion spent by all indigenous China semiconductor suppliers combined.

However, a review of In-Q-Tel&#8217;s current portfolio companies reveals less than 5% are chip startups, making this call for greater chip investment ring a bit hollow. In-Q-Tel should increase investment in US chip firms and coordinate support for those firms with DOD acquisition leaders. A quick analysis finds 25+ US chip startups that align with this report&#8217;s recommendations, but lack USG funding. It also finds Chinese investors maintain an active, though reduced, presence in US microelectronics VC. </p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbd11085-c9c3-41d2-a73b-66022ba8f563_438x546.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbd11085-c9c3-41d2-a73b-66022ba8f563_438x546.png" width="438" height="546" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/dbd11085-c9c3-41d2-a73b-66022ba8f563_438x546.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:546,&quot;width&quot;:438,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbd11085-c9c3-41d2-a73b-66022ba8f563_438x546.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbd11085-c9c3-41d2-a73b-66022ba8f563_438x546.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbd11085-c9c3-41d2-a73b-66022ba8f563_438x546.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbd11085-c9c3-41d2-a73b-66022ba8f563_438x546.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h3>Background:</h3><p>Founded in 1999, In-Q-Tel (IQT) &#8220;scouts the global market for cutting-edge technologies that have both high national security impact and the potential for commercial success.&#8221; Unlike most of the intelligence community, IQT operates in public as an independent, non-profit strategic investor for the CIA. It hires from government, venture capital, and industry. It has a <a href="https://www.iqt.org/blog/">blog</a>, a <a href="https://www.iqt.org/resources-news/podcasts/">podcast</a>, and it talks publicly about its investments. It also publishes &#8220;<a href="https://www.iqt.org/resources/">insight and thought leadership</a>&#8221; reports. Their Winter 2021 issue was on &#8220;<a href="https://www.iqt.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IQT-Insights_The-National-Microelectronics-Challenge_final.pdf">The National Microelectronics Challenge</a>.&#8221;</p><h3>Summary of Paper:</h3><p>The paper is short (8 pages) and worth reading in full. The first half is an overview of the industry, technology trends, security considerations, and private sector investment gaps related to microelectronics production and supply chain security.</p><p>The second half of the paper is much more interesting and novel. The authors begin by using (January 2018) PitchBook data to establish:</p><blockquote><p>of the 215 U.S. microelectronics companies that received private funding during 2015-2017, only five were design software firms, eight sold novel tooling equipment, and nine were in semiconductor IP.</p></blockquote><p>They go on to argue that, while proposals to boost research funding and build fabrication facilities are important for economic and national security reasons, there are important sub-sectors of the industry that are being neglected by private investors. The punchline isn&#8217;t surprising: <em>&#8220;there is a dearth of trusted private investment in the microelectronics startups of the greatest potential national security import.&#8221;</em></p><h4>Key Recommendations</h4><p>The thing this report does better than any other USG report is emphasize the role of commercialization. Simply put, the burn rate in the semiconductor industry is so high that every chip startup needs to have a commercialization strategy. As a partial solution to reduce this industry-wide burn rate, the authors propose the USG support under-invested areas of the chip industry&#8217;s startup landscape with:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Commercialization Infrastructure</strong>: a public-private partnership that provides industry and academia access to advanced commercial equipment to replicate industry requirements, and enable feedback loops from commercialization back to research. This &#8220;microelectronics commons,&#8221; &#8220;national semiconductor center,&#8221; &#8220;Lab-to-Fab facility,&#8221; and/or &#8220;hardware sandbox&#8221; would focus on:</p><ul><li><p>Semiconductor manufacturing equipment (the report calls this &#8220;tooling&#8221;)</p></li><li><p>Advanced packaging</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Microelectronics Investment Fund</strong>: this fund would bridge the gap between the innovation pipeline and scaling of a commercial enterprise. The authors suggest a fund of $250 million over five years, targeting key areas such as toolsets, advanced packaging, and origin-agnostic security technologies. They highlight four firms in need of investment developing chip-related technologies:</p><ul><li><p>&#8220;Direct write&#8221; of circuits (a non-photolithography approach to patterning)</p></li><li><p>Automated optical inspection systems for defect analysis of wafers</p></li><li><p>"Lego blocks" approach to chiplet assembly, accelerating custom designs</p></li><li><p>Hardware-level security processor for embedded systems</p></li></ul></li></ol><h4>Reviewing These Recommendations: A Mixed Bag</h4><p>These proposals are good. The way the recommendations are structured indicates the author&#8217;s know this industry. But these recommendations are strange for two reasons: </p><ol><li><p><strong>The recommendations are redundant</strong>: the CHIPS Act, passed as part of the January 2021 NDAA, calls for a semiconductor investment fund (<a href="https://semiliterate.substack.com/p/the-chips-act-microelectronics-and">section 9905</a>) and tasks the Secretary of Commerce with establishing a PPP, the &#8220;National Semiconductor Technology Center,&#8221; to promote R&amp;D in to semiconductor manufacturing equipment and establish a National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program (<a href="https://semiliterate.substack.com/p/the-chips-act-microelectronics-and">section 9906</a>).

Surely IQT, the US government entity tasked with commercial funding of innovative advanced technologies that have national security implications, is on the case?

There are 9 companies in IQT&#8217;s portfolio doing microelectronics-related work:</p><h4>Name                             // Sub-sector                              // Status</h4><p><strong>D-Wave Systems</strong>             // Quantum                               // Privately held</p><p><strong>GainSpan</strong>                        // Wi-fi                                   // acquired by Telit (UK)</p><p><strong>Lime Microsystems</strong>      // Wireless broadband              // Privately held</p><p><strong>Mythic</strong>                            // Artificial intelligence            // Privately held</p><p><strong>Newlans</strong>                         // Radio frequency                      // Privately held</p><p><strong>Pixim</strong>                            // Video semiconductors       // acquired by Sony (Japan)</p><p><strong>Redlen Technologies</strong> // Radiation detection                     // Privately held</p><p><strong>SiOnyx</strong>                          // Photonics                                    // Privately held</p><p><strong>WiSpry</strong>                        // Radio frequency          // acquired by AAC Technologies (China)</p><h3>What Does This All Tell Us?</h3><p>IQT&#8217;s recommendations and this follow-on analysis reveal (1) subject matter expertise, (2) a lack of awareness of current US government policy and initiatives concerning microelectronics, and (3) under-investment in the very industry they are claiming needs <em>more</em> investment on national security grounds.</p><ol><li><p><strong>The authors know the industry</strong>. In addition to this deep subject matter expertise, IQT is investing with some of the best venture capital firms. This is an uncommonly high level of expertise for a USG-affiliated entity. They have the skills and ability (if not the capital) to solve the problem they&#8217;ve identified. </p></li><li><p><strong>Analytical gaps</strong>: (A) the Commercialization Infrastructure and Investment Fund ideas have already been passed as part of the CHIPS Act, making the recommendations redundant. (B) The <a href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/tc/">DOD Trusted Capital</a> program is designed to address the very problem the authors&#8217; diagnose: facilitating trusted private investment into critical and emerging technologies. No mention of the program in the paper. (C) The report doesn&#8217;t engage with many ideas in the 25+ substantive reports published about this industry in the last 5 years. For example, a&nbsp;<a href="https://potomacinstitute.org/images/studies/CARTSsm.pdf">recent </a>study advocates for the same kind of chip PPP the authors propose.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hardware is hard</strong>. Obviously the microelectronics problems facing the United States are not IQT&#8217;s alone to solve, but surely they could devote more than 5% of their portfolio to the industry. 50%+ of IQT&#8217;s portfolio is non-hardware focused. Microelectronics hardware is notoriously difficult and costly. One <a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2021/01/21/hardware-is-hard/">recent</a> back-of-the-envelope analysis found the most boot-strapped chip startup would still burn through $1.5 million in 9 months to get a minimum viable product. To get to first revenue would <a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2019/09/30/3042/">cost</a> $20 million and then scaling that is likely to take another $20 million. The &#8220;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/death-valley-curve.asp#:~:text=Death%20valley%20curve%20is%20an,on%20their%20initial%20invested%20capital.&amp;text=It%20is%20a%20significant%20milestone%20for%20startup%20companies.">valley of death</a>&#8221; between innovation and commercialization is real and patient capital (like IQT&#8217;s) is hard to come by for a hardware startup.</p></li></ol><h3>How IQT Can Support US Microelectronics Innovation</h3><p>IQT has correctly diagnosed the problem, now they need to act on their prescription. (1) IQT already does <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/iqt">emerging technology analysis for DHS</a>, they need to start sharing their market research analysis with DOD Service Acquisition Executives who can direct funds towards portfolio companies. (2) The IQT portfolio should be over-weight in microelectronics startups given how fundamental chips are to each of the industries they invest in (Trusted Infrastructure, Artificial Intelligence, Biotech etc) and how under-invested microelectronics is by private VC. To expand on both points:</p><ol><li><p><strong>DOD should buy more from IQT portfolio companies</strong>: Only 69 of IQT&#8217;s 216 portfolio companies have a recent DOD contract/purchase order. Add to that the 72 IQT portfolio companies that have been acquired (at that point they&#8217;re no longer &#8220;startups&#8221;) and remove the sum from the pool. That leaves 74 startups in which IQT has invested that lack any commercial relationship with the largest source of national security funding. The IQT stamp of approval seems like it should be good enough for AFWERX, DIU, AFC, NavalX, and SOFWERX to evaluate each of these 74 companies in light of their requirements.</p></li><li><p><strong>IQT should create and share an open-source list of microelectronics startups</strong>: IQT should share its market research with USG entities who have funds to spend, who have microelectronics equities, and who don&#8217;t have access to investment data/startup expertise. Why not conduct a simple open-source exercise to expand IQT portfolio lead generation and share the results with DHS/DOD?: look up chip startups that have closed a funding round since 2015, see which ones have existing USG relationships, and vet for a scope of work that fits within the report&#8217;s recommendations? </p></li></ol><h4>Proposed Analysis of US Chip Startup Ecosystem and Eligible Firms<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3">3</a></h4><p>The findings of this proposed analysis are striking:</p><ul><li><p><strong>300+</strong> US chip startups have taken funding since 2015 (this is a very conservative number of deals but its derived from free data, so you get what you pay for).</p></li><li><p><strong>85</strong> startups took a loan from the Small Business Administration/Paycheck Protection Program in 2020 (indicative of some level of financial distress).</p></li><li><p><strong>51</strong> startups have at least 1 DOD contract/purchase order in the last 10 years.</p></li><li><p><strong>30</strong> startups have taken funding from the National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, and/or NASA.</p></li><li><p><strong>~20</strong> startups have had a funding round that included one or more Chinese investor. 10% of US microelectronics VC in 2020 had one Chinese investor.</p></li><li><p><strong>~15</strong> startups are working on advanced materials, <strong>~5</strong> on Electronic Design Automation, and <strong>~5</strong> working on advanced packaging solutions. Most don&#8217;t have USG contracts. Seems like a target-rich environment for lead generation.</p></li><li><p><strong>2</strong> companies in this exercise have taken investment from IQT. Theres lots of room for IQT to expand in the microelectronics space.</p></li></ul><p>The analysis could easily be extended depending on ones priorities: </p><ol><li><p>Look at when companies closed their last funding round (find out which companies are going to need funds soon); </p></li><li><p>Filter for companies that have already taken investment from Intel Capital, Applied Ventures, Qualcomm Ventures etc. and other leading industry investment funds. Industry knows better than anyone which high-risk/high-reward ideas are worth investing in. Follow their lead when making investment or procurement decisions. </p></li></ol><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>There are plenty of gaps in this proposed analysis but the whole thing took a few hours and used (messy) free data. The subject matter expertise demonstrated by the authors of this paper indicates they could do much better analysis and their findings could inform other parts of government while helping US chip startups. IQT is deliberately not a policy-making organization, but it can at least inform policy decisions that respond to this report&#8217;s recommendations with its clear expertise.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>The views here are my own and drawn solely from the documents I cite.</em></p><div class="footnote" id="footnote-1"><a href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>CrunchBase data has its problems and these numbers are probably off.

Public comments submitted by the US semiconductor industry in response to this proposal convey their extreme alarm at the prospect. These controls would potentially limit US microelectronics firm sales to their largest and fastest-growing export market, damaging China&#8217;s industrial policy goals in the short term and harming the US industry&#8217;s competitiveness in the long term. Broad controls could result in lost sales, reduced innovation, &amp; trade diversion.

Congress was concerned about (1) Chinese ownership, control, and/or influence over US technology companies and (2) US technology company sales of their products to China. This was big-deal once-per-decade legislation designed to address a specific problem: </p><blockquote><p><em>How does the US respond to massively-activist Chinese industrial&nbsp;policies designed to dominate the&nbsp;technologies that will confer the greatest economic and national security benefit in the coming decades?</em></p></blockquote><p>The US export control system regulates dual-use exports (goods and technology that have both civilian and military uses). ECRA updated the export control system to address concerns about China&#8217;s attempts to seek global civilian and military leadership in advanced and emerging technologies through coordinated industrial policies. The Commerce Department is now taking ECRA&#8217;s intent and codifying it in regulations.</p><h3>The Trade Offs</h3><p>FIRRMA and ECRA have generated US business concerns because they tighten technology trade and investment with China, which is a growing market for many firms and a source of easy capital for others. This tightening is good in the eyes of a US government increasingly concerned by Chinese purchases of certain US advanced technologies. This is bad in the eyes of US technology companies who derive a large part of their cap table or profits from sales to/investments from China. </p><h4>China Needs the US</h4><p>One advanced technology the US is particularly good at making is chips. Part of China&#8217;s semiconductor industrial plans call for acquiring companies and technologies that make chips. This has resulted in well-documented tensions over Chinese attempts to buy &#8220;<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/22/china-us-tech-companies-cfius-572413">crown jewel</a>&#8221; US chip companies to accelerate its industry&#8217;s progress. Traditional mergers and acquisitions by Chinese investors of US chip companies have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/10/business/us-china-investment-cfius.html">halted</a> by the US government for the foreseeable future via the investment screening reforms in FIRRMA. But, Chinese purchases of chip technologies from US firms remain largely permitted, pending updated controls called for by ECRA. </p><p>As it attempts to ramp up domestic production of chips, Chinese industrial policies have increased demand for tools that enable chip design and fabrication. From <a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/2020-10-26_R46581_ee55af430d9ef4cf749766bbe749625b5c759b1a.pdf">2015-19</a> China tripled its number of advanced chip factories and in 2019 HiSilicon (a Huawei chip design subsidiary) became the <a href="https://www.icinsights.com/news/bulletins/HiSilicon-First-ChinaBased-Semi-Supplier-To-Be-Ranked-In-Top10/">first</a> Chinese fabless firm to rank among the top-10 semiconductor sales leaders worldwide. These advances were achieved using US chips technologies, resulting in a stark <a href="https://beta.regulations.gov/document/BIS-2020-0029-0022">interdependence</a> between the two industries: </p><blockquote><p>in the past five years, the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME) in China has grown from 5% of the world&#8217;s total spending to over 25%. It is impossible to divorce the health of the U.S. semiconductor equipment industry from access to Chinese markets.</p></blockquote><h4>The US Needs China</h4><p>Though Chinese semiconductor industrial policies have been <a href="https://semiliterate.substack.com/p/made-in-china-2025-and-semiconductors">modestly successful</a> at best, the growth of the Chinese chip market has been great news for US SME and electronic design automation (EDA) firms eager to sell and license their tools to China&#8217;s new factories and chip design firms. As US firms sell their products to China, they reinvest the profits derived from these sales in to R&amp;D, using their well-funded budgets to innovate and thereby maintain their technological leadership. China is basically funding the US chip industry&#8217;s innovation budget, ensuring it is even harder for Chinese chip firms to catch up with the industry leaders.</p><p>If the Commerce Department decides SME &amp; EDA are &#8220;foundational&#8221; technologies, US firms could be prohibited from selling some of their products to key customers. This would be devastating for China&#8217;s technological ambitions in the short term and damaging for the US semiconductor industry&#8217;s competitiveness in the long term.</p><h2>Summary of Foundational Tech Comments:</h2><h4>Are Chips &#8220;Foundational&#8221;?</h4><p>Intuitively, most people know chips are foundational to life in 2021. The computer, laptop, tablet, or phone that you read this blog on is powered by chips. This blog is hosted by servers composed of chips. The software on which Substack functions was designed around the hardware capabilities of chips.</p><p>However there <em>are</em> a few technologies <em>more foundational</em> than chips: the software (EDA) and machines (SME) used to design and make the chips that go in the electronic devices that power daily life are more foundational than the chips themselves. As a result, when Commerce solicited comments on new export controls on foundational technologies, the US chip industry, especially SME companies, responded in force.</p><h4>Background: Public Comments Process</h4><p><a href="https://beta.regulations.gov/">Regulations.gov</a> allows anyone to comment when a US government agency publishes an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rule Making (ANPRM) and those comments are then made public. These comments are a fantastic resource for policymakers and the level of detail in some submissions is remarkable. The only other time companies of this size publicly reveal so much about their own business practices and competition is in SEC filings, and the level of detail exceeds that of a 10-K in some respects.</p><p>The Commerce Department<a href="https://www.regulations.gov/docket?D=BIS-2020-0029"> has posted 60 comments</a> submitted by individuals, companies, and associations in response to its proposed foundational technologies rule-making. <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/docketBrowser?rpp=25&amp;so=DESC&amp;sb=commentDueDate&amp;po=0&amp;dct=PS&amp;D=BIS-2020-0029">Comments</a> were submitted by 13 chip companies and associations:</p><h4>Organization Name || Length of Comments || <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/research/securing-semiconductor-supply-chains/">% of Sales to China</a> </h4><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=BIS-2020-0029-0024">The Semiconductor Equipment Association of Japan</a> (SEAJ) || 2 pages </p></li><li><p><a href="https://beta.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2020-0029-0059">Marvell Semiconductor</a> || 4 pages || 40%</p></li><li><p><a href="https://beta.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2020-0029-0061">Intel</a> || 11 pages || 27%</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=BIS-2020-0029-0045">Ampere Computing</a> || 14 pages || Privately held</p></li><li><p><a href="https://beta.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2020-0029-0049">ASML</a> || 15 pages || 15%</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=BIS-2020-0029-0025">IBM</a> || 17 pages || Unknown</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=BIS-2020-0029-0044">SEMI</a> (association) || 22 pages </p></li><li><p><a href="https://beta.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2020-0029-0055">Lam Research</a> || 24 pages || 16%</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=BIS-2020-0029-0047">Applied Materials</a> || 25 pages || 29%</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=BIS-2020-0029-0032">Cadence Design Systems</a> || 33 pages, 11 (!) attachments || 10%</p></li><li><p><a href="https://beta.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2020-0029-0012">Teradyne</a> || 38 pages || 22%</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=BIS-2020-0029-0022">KLA</a> || 38 pages || 16%</p></li><li><p><a href="https://beta.regulations.gov/comment/BIS-2020-0029-0054">Semiconductor Industry Association</a> (SIA) || 38 pages</p></li></ul><h3>Who are these companies, what do they do, why do they care?: A metaphor</h3><p>The lay reader is probably not familiar with some of these companies so it may be confusing why they would cumulatively pay for 275+ pages of very expensive lawyer hours to comment on some obscure rule. A brief metaphor might be helpful: </p><p>Think of making a chip like baking a cake. You get out a recipe book, find the right page, pre-heat the oven, mix baking powder, flour, eggs, &amp; sugar in a bowl, pour the batter in a pan, put that pan in the oven, and then pull it out when its done. Applied Materials, ASML, and Lam Research make ovens. Marvell, Ampere, and IBM come up with recipes, but don&#8217;t bake cake. Intel comes up with recipes AND bakes cake. Teradyne and KLA provide quality control, making sure all cakes look and taste right. Cadence publishes the recipe book and numbers your pages. Combined, they make <em>very</em> expensive cake.</p><p>These are big, well-funded firms that stand to lose billions if they cannot sell to a market that accounts for 10-40% of their annual sales. Applied Materials, Lam Research, and KLA have a combined market cap equivalent to that of Exxon. ASML is currently worth more than Volkswagen, the largest automaker in the world. The length of their comments loosely correlates to the level of concern they are feeling. </p><h2>What the Comments Say:</h2><p>All of these comments reflect company-specific equities, but its worth summarizing some overarching concerns and recommendations these comments share.</p><h3>Main Concerns:</h3><p>US semiconductor firms are extremely concerned poorly structured export controls on foundational technologies will:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Harm profits</strong>: reduce sales to their largest and fastest-growing market (China).</p></li><li><p><strong>Harm innovation</strong>: reduced profits mean US firms have less money to invest in R&amp;D to win through innovation. Every dollar US firms lose in sales is won by a competitor, which they then use to fund R&amp;D to improve competing products.</p></li><li><p><strong>Harm competitiveness:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Trade diversion</strong>: there is foreign availability of some SME and some EDA, so unilateral controls would advantage companies located in countries not subject to new controls. US companies may also choose to off-shore production to their overseas subsidiaries to avoid new controls.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Decreased long term viability</strong>: unilateral controls would push current customers to competitors, encourage customers to design-out US products, and undermine US firm recruiting &amp; retaining of non-US talent. </p></li><li><p><strong>Accelerate tech indigenization</strong>: restricting access to US SME &amp; EDA will increase China&#8217;s sense of urgency to end reliance on the US industry.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h3>Main Recommendations:</h3><p>US microelectronics firms also realize the status quo is not tenable. In addition to explaining policies they are against, they share several recommendations: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Plurilateral controls (partner with allies), not unilateral controls</strong>: The US should partner with other countries that produce SME and EDA (especially Japan and in Europe) to minimize trade diversion associated with unilateral controls. The unilateral controls targeting <a href="https://www.globaltradeandsanctionslaw.com/u-s-commerce-department-imposes-new-restrictions-on-huawei/">Huawei in 2020</a> were damaging to US firms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Narrowly define &#8220;foundational technologies&#8221;</strong>: Google&#8217;s <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=BIS-2020-0029-0060">proposal</a> seems balanced</p></li><li><p><strong>End-use/end-user controls</strong>, not technology-based controls</p></li><li><p><strong>Use OFAC, not BIS, to target China</strong> (financial sanctions &gt;  export controls)</p></li><li><p><strong>Focus on innovation</strong> (promote) &gt; export controls (protect). Run faster to win.</p></li></ul><h3>A Case Study in Trade Offs: Cadence Design Systems</h3><h4>Introduction</h4><p>Cadence is a real-deal crown jewel of the US semiconductor industry. Founded in the late 1980s in Silicon Valley, it has ~9,000 employees, annual revenue of $2 billion (investing 40% of that in R&amp;D), and is one part of a three-company oligopoly that provides EDA tools for designing&nbsp;integrated circuits. Controls on exports of EDA to China were <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/08/20/2020-18213/addition-of-huawei-non-us-affiliates-to-the-entity-list-the-removal-of-temporary-general-license-and">called out</a> when targeting Huawei in 2020, so Cadence is rightly concerned by this new proposal and <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=BIS-2020-0029-0032">their extremely detailed comments</a> reflect that concern.</p><h4>What Cadence Does</h4><p>If you are reading this blog, there is a 100% chance that you are doing so on a device that contains some Cadence IP. <a href="http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000813672/6b6a4323-d278-491a-b5e0-430dabcf2404.pdf">Their 10-K</a>, which is understated, begins:</p><blockquote><p>We offer software, hardware, services and reusable IC [integrated circuit] design blocks, which are commonly referred to as intellectual property (&#8220;IP&#8221;). Customers use our offerings to develop and integrate software that is key to the functionality of their products, as well as to design their ICs&#8230; Using our systems, customers deliver  devices such as smartphones, laptops, gaming systems, automobiles, autonomous driving systems, cloud datacenter infrastructure, AI systems &amp; medical equipment.</p></blockquote><p>In plain English: if you want to make a chip you need to license IP blocks. Cadence is one of three companies that makes these IP blocks. Most electronic devices made since 2010 probably contain some Cadence IP. &#8220;Ubiquitous&#8221; is an understatement.</p><h4>Why Cadence is a Good and Bad Target for Foundational Controls</h4><p>Cadence illustrates the trade offs US policymakers face with respect to controls on exports of "foundational technologies.&#8221; To policymakers concerned about China&#8217;s efforts to make memory chips (commercial end use) and radiation hardened integrated circuits that go in satellites (military end use), it makes sense to target the underlying US-origin technology that enable both end uses. Two birds with one stone and all that. China <em>needs</em> Cadence (and its two EDA competitors, which combined have 90% of the Chinese EDA market) to design chips. At first blush, restricting Cadence/US EDA exports make for an appealing policy tool to slow China&#8217;s chip ascendence:</p><ol><li><p><strong>EDA is a foundational chokepoint</strong>: China needs it, the US has it</p></li><li><p><strong>Limited foreign availability</strong>: US EDA firms enjoy <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/research/securing-semiconductor-supply-chains/">96% market share</a> worldwide</p></li><li><p><strong>First mover advantage</strong>: US EDA firms benefit from high barriers to entry, a massive IP moat, and deep pockets capable of buying upstart competitors. There have been basically no serious challengers to their oligopoly in decades.</p></li><li><p><strong>China is not as important a customer for EDA firms as it is for SME</strong>: &#8220;only&#8221; 10% of Cadence&#8217;s annual sales are derived from China. Most fabless chip design  (Cadence&#8217;s customers) is done by US, European, and Asian firms.</p></li></ol><p>It&#8217;s worth noting here that Cadence attempts to rebut points 1, 2, and 3 above in their linked comments. There are also a few obvious drawbacks: </p><ol><li><p>96% market share is not 100%. There are Chinese firms working on EDA tools. Cutting off access to US EDA tools would incentivize accelerating that work.</p></li><li><p>EDA tools are sold via software licenses. Licenses can be copied. Some of these tools have already been licensed in China so there may be no getting them back.</p></li><li><p>There are <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/research/the-semiconductor-supply-chain/">roughly</a> 1,500 EDA engineers working in China, though only ~300 work for Chinese firms. The US EDA workforce would take a hit if those 1,200 employees could no longer work in China and/or chose to stay in China.</p></li></ol><p>This mixed-bag of trade offs is indicative: every US microelectronics firm has complicated considerations. Here&#8217;s Cadence&#8217;s (hyperbolic, yet cautionary) conclusion:</p><blockquote><p>Cadence submits that strict, unilateral export control regulations on US EDA tools will have the opposite effect as intended. They will curtail the US EDA industry, while accelerating growth and innovation for Chinese and other foreign EDA companies. Such regulations will decrease US EDA revenue, suppress innovation, cut jobs, and result in US EDA companies losing global relevance. Meanwhile, they will not impede Chinese companies in their ability to design and develop advanced electronic components, instead incentivizing growth in the Chinese EDA industry&#8230; and may cause Chinese EDA companies to surpass US EDA companies.</p></blockquote><h2>Conclusion: Supporting the US Microelectronics Industry while Reforming Export Controls</h2><p>The picture painted above is complicated: China is clearly pursuing advances in microelectronics with the goal of promoting its economic and national security. The US microelectronics industry is profiting enormously from China&#8217;s pursuit, but risks upsetting a US government increasingly concerned by China&#8217;s advances. The US government wants to slow China&#8217;s ascendence, but doing so risks the profits and innovation which have made the US chip industry a crown jewel of the tech industry. </p><h4>Restrict microelectronics exports to China &amp; minimize US firm losses</h4><p>The goal of US export controls on foundational technologies should be to <em>slow</em> (there is no stopping) China&#8217;s indigenization and development of advanced chip technologies:</p><ul><li><p>Do not apply controls on US-origin commercial chips and avoid targeting Chinese companies unless justified (don&#8217;t be myopic about Huawei)</p></li><li><p>Focus foundational controls on sales of all SME and EDA to China required to produce the most advanced chips: anything below 16/14 nanometers.</p><ul><li><p>For example: (1) allow EDA firms to continue licensing EDA packaging and printed circuit board tools in China (both have widespread foreign, and in-country, availability) but (2) restrict licensing of EDA digital IC design tools (logic synthesis tools, design for test tools, and IC manufacturing tools for resolution enhancement technologies in particular).</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Make new controls on SME &amp; EDA plurilateral. Ensure US competitors in Japan and the Netherlands don&#8217;t fill the void by increasing their sales to China. This will maximize the effectiveness of the controls and minimize US firm losses.</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/research/securing-semiconductor-supply-chains/">One estimate</a> of the value of lost sales from export controls on &lt;16nm SME from the US, Japan, and Netherlands in 2021 is $920 million combined.</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p>Mitigate the cost of lost sales via <a href="https://semiliterate.substack.com/p/the-chips-act-microelectronics-and">CHIPS Act</a> funds, using money made available in sections 9902, 9903, and 9905 to offset reduced R&amp;D budgets of US SME and EDA firms and US allies. (side note: Offsetting $920 million is nothing. DOD <a href="https://www.eetimes.com/dod-expands-trusted-chip-deal-with-globalfoundries/">gave</a> GlobalFoundries $400 million last November and no one noticed.)</p><ul><li><p>Means test the offsets: the more a company can demonstrate lost sales to China stem from new export controls (as Teredyne and KLA did in the comments linked above) the more money they should be eligible for.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h4>Reform Export Controls</h4><p>The export control system is in desperate need of reform more generally. It&#8217;s still operating in mostly the same structure its had since The Cold War. But, export controls are technical and arcane and most of the costs borne by the export control system are B2B, so public interest in reform is limited. The most substantive <a href="https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/rethinking-export-controls-unintended-consequences-and-the-new-technological-landscape">recent proposal</a> on reforming the US export control system came from CNAS.</p><p>A joint comment by <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=BIS-2020-0029-0056">Microsoft/OpenAI</a> is by far the most creative proposal to reform the entire US export control system. Microsoft picked up <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/staff/dr-william-chappell">Bill Chappell</a>, the former head of DARPA&#8217;s Microsystems Technology Office, to become its Chief Technology Officer for Azure in 2019. Its ambitious proposal to <a href="https://www.rambus.com/blogs/darpa-wants-secure-silicon-and-scalable-defense-mechanisms/">embed software features</a>, <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/supply-chain-hardware-integrity-for-electronics-defense">hardware roots of trust</a>, and <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/attachments/ATrustthroughTechnologyApproach_FINAL.PDF">tamper-resistant tools</a> in to foundational technologies echoes some of the work the MTO pursued under his leadership. However, if <a href="https://bis.doc.gov/">the BIS website</a> is any indication of the agency&#8217;s technical acumen, this proposal is a bit beyond them. The US export control system operates in black and white, so the proposals above are going to require creativity from agencies that aren&#8217;t known for it.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>:&nbsp;<em>the views here are my own and drawn solely from the documents I cite here.</em></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The CHIPS Act, Microelectronics, and the 2021 NDAA]]></title><description><![CDATA[With an eye toward China, overdue help for the US semiconductor industry arrives]]></description><link>https://semiliterate.substack.com/p/the-chips-act-microelectronics-and</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://semiliterate.substack.com/p/the-chips-act-microelectronics-and</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Semi-Literate]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jan 2021 16:06:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57cefa1c-2c86-4cbc-ae06-fef3c131dded_1200x675.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Welcome to Semi-Literate, a guide to the chip industry through the lens of public policy.

The CHIPS Act focuses on incentives to build or modernize fabs so that <em>more</em> chips, and <em>more advanced</em> chips, are made in the US. This focus on fabrication is appropriate, but it comes with trade offs: the Act underemphasizes innovation, calls for redundant reports, lacks detailed technical roadmaps, and mostly ignores workforce issues facing the industry.

The Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors <a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2020/6/bipartisan-bicameral-bill-will-help-bring-production-of-semiconductors-critical-to-national-security-back-to-u-s">(CHIPS) Act</a> is now law. The CHIPS Act, which incorporates provisions of the <a href="https://www.schumer.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/with-the-support-of-new-yorks-semiconductor-industry-schumer-announces-bipartisan-american-foundries-act-bolstering-us-leadership-in-microelectronics-sector-dramatically-increasing-investment-in-domestic-facilities-and-keeping-production-on-our-shores">American</a> <a href="https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2020/6/risch-introduces-bill-to-support-semiconductor-manufacturing-in-u-s">Foundries</a> <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/4130/text">Act</a>, is the largest coordinated effort by the US government to support the microelectronics industry since standing up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEMATECH">SEMATECH</a> in 1987. However the NDAA is an authorization bill (which directs how federal funds should or should not be used) <em>not</em> an appropriations bill, so final funding amounts will be decided by Congressional appropriators in 2021. They will likely mirror <a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2020/6/bipartisan-bicameral-bill-will-help-bring-production-of-semiconductors-critical-to-national-security-back-to-u-s">amounts</a> <a href="https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/s3933/BILLS-116s3933is.pdf">in the original June 2020 version of the CHIPS Act</a>.</p><h4>The Problem</h4><p>This legislation was drafted, much like <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/IF10952.pdf">FIRRMA</a>, in response to a problem: <em>how does the US respond to massively-activist Chinese industrial&nbsp;policies designed to dominate the&nbsp;technologies that will confer the greatest economic and national security benefit in the coming decades?</em> The US government is concerned with China&#8217;s efforts to promote its  microelectronics industry and the effect these efforts are having on the US industry. The US <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/National-Strategy-for-CET.pdf?utm_source=morning_brew">strategic response</a> to &#8220;protect&#8221; and &#8220;promote&#8221; these technologies calls for carrots and sticks. FIRRMA was a stick. The CHIPS Act is a carrot.</p><h4>The Solution</h4><p>The top-level solutions proposed in the legislation are straightforward:</p><ul><li><p>The US needs to make more chips in fabs physically located in the US.</p></li><li><p>The DOD needs more secure, advanced, and custom Made in the USA chips.</p></li><li><p>The US should be more activist &amp; strategic in support for microelectronics R&amp;D.</p></li><li><p>US allies need to share its thinking about the importance of microelectronics.</p></li></ul><h4>(There are no solutions, only trade-offs)</h4><p>The basic tension in this legislation is how much to focus incentives on commercial priorities (profit, volume, economies of scale, innovation) vs. defense priorities (customization, reliability, trust, integrity) with respect to the microelectronics industry. US microelectronics firms face this tension all the time: It is much more profitable for a fab to produce <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/computing/315186-apple-books-tsmcs-entire-5nm-production-capability">74 million</a> of the exact same chip for an iPhone (<em>high volume, low mix</em>) than 600 <a href="https://www.cobhamaes.com/rf-microwave-and-millimeterwave-microelectronics/news/cobham-receives-51m-in-orders-for-f-35-lightning-ii/">chips for F-35</a>s or 140 chips for <a href="https://www.baesystems.com/en-us/article/bae-systems-secures-production-contract-for-thaad-interceptor-seekers">THAAD air defense systems</a> (<em>high mix, low volume</em>). US companies do microelectronics work that is purely commercial (ex. Intel, AMD), a mix of commercial and defense (ex. GlobalFoundries, CREE), and mainly defense (ex. BAE, SkyWater). This Act tried to balance incentives for both commercial and defense, yet was <a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/chipmakers-petition-language-change-funding-bill-include-mission-critical-devices/">criticized by defense firms as too-focused</a> on incentives for commercial chip firms. There are no solutions, only trade-offs.</p><h2>Notable Provisions in the CHIPS Act</h2><h4>Sec. 9902. Semiconductor incentives.</h4><p>These incentives are aimed squarely at commercial chip firms. The Secretary of Commerce will coordinate federal financial assistance to incentivize investment in facilities and equipment in the United States for semiconductor fabrication, assembly, testing, advanced packaging, and/or research &amp; development. Incentives (grants) are capped at $3 billion per recipient and can only be used to finance the construction, expansion, or modernization of a facility or equipment to be used for semiconductors. There is a clawback provision if deliverables are not met on time (*cough* <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21526765/foxconn-lcd-factory-not-real-confirmation-wisconsin-report-exclusive">Foxconn</a>), a prohibition on recipients engaging in a joint venture/licensing effort with a foreign entity of concern (*<a href="https://www.extremetech.com/computing/294372-amd-denies-report-it-gave-china-keys-to-the-kingdom-violated-national-security">cough</a>* <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-tried-to-stop-china-acquiring-world-class-chips-china-got-them-anyway-11561646798">AMD</a>), and mandatory GAO audits of the program.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c2d423f-d5f4-4169-ac0f-b67c9da70cb6_440x440.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c2d423f-d5f4-4169-ac0f-b67c9da70cb6_440x440.jpeg" width="440" height="440" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7c2d423f-d5f4-4169-ac0f-b67c9da70cb6_440x440.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:440,&quot;width&quot;:440,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) | Federal Labs&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) | Federal Labs" title="Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) | Federal Labs" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c2d423f-d5f4-4169-ac0f-b67c9da70cb6_440x440.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c2d423f-d5f4-4169-ac0f-b67c9da70cb6_440x440.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c2d423f-d5f4-4169-ac0f-b67c9da70cb6_440x440.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c2d423f-d5f4-4169-ac0f-b67c9da70cb6_440x440.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h4>Sec. 9903. Department of Defense (DOD).</h4><p>The DOD-related provisions in the NDAA amount to broad reforms to the <a href="https://www.dmea.osd.mil/TrustedIC.aspx">DOD Trusted Foundry Program</a> (managed by <a href="http://dmea.osd.mil/">DMEA</a>). This is good. <a href="https://semiengineering.com/a-crisis-in-dods-trusted-foundry-program/">It&#8217;s been clear for a while</a> that the ~<a href="https://www.dmea.osd.mil/otherdocs/accreditedsuppliers.pdf">15 or so commercial fabs</a> that provide trusted fabrication services to the DOD are <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/2192120/dod-adopts-zero-trust-approach-to-buying-microelectronics/">not capable of meeting</a> the full spectrum of DOD chip requirements.</p><p>The CHIPS Act tasks DOD with establishing a public-private partnership (PPP) to incentivize formation of consortia of companies &#8220;to ensure the development and production of <em>measurably secure</em> microelectronics [emphasis added],&#8221; with a focus on radio frequency, mixed signal, radiation tolerant, and radiation hardened microelectronics. Incentives can include, but are not limited to, grants under Section 9902. All participants in said consortia need to meet the standards of &#8220;trusted microelectronics&#8221; as established in <a href="https://www.congress.gov/116/plaws/publ92/PLAW-116publ92.pdf">the 2020 NDAA</a> (see Section 224).</p><p>DOD is also responsible for standing up a National Network for Microelectronics Development to commercialize emerging innovations, encourage the participation of &#8220;nontraditional defense contractors [startups],&#8221; and provide a bunch of reports: </p><ul><li><p>a plan to maintain production of modern and legacy DOD chips (<strong>start <a href="https://www.ndia.org/divisions/working-groups/tmejwg">here</a></strong>)</p></li><li><p>a report written with the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine on &#8220;optimal&#8221; PPP structure by October 1, 2022; (<strong>copy <a href="https://potomacinstitute.org/images/studies/CARTSsm.pdf">this one</a></strong>)</p></li><li><p>a report detailing how DOD is going to accomplish all these requirements; and</p></li><li><p>biennial DOD Comptroller reports on how things are going financially.</p></li></ul><h4>Sec. 9904. Department of Commerce study on status of microelectronics technologies in the United States industrial base. </h4><p>Commerce is to begin a survey of the US microelectronics industrial base. This survey and report will be done by its Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), using Defense Production Act (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Production_Act_of_1950">DPA</a>) authorities. BIS can compel mandatory survey responses under the DPA and issue fines to those who do not respond. It&#8217;s a &#8220;who, what, where, when, how, why&#8221; sort-of-survey. One novel angle is requiring survey recipients to disclose if they&#8217;ve gotten similar information requests from the Chinese government and if they have any commercial relationship with the Chinese military.</p><h4>Sec. 9905. Funding for development and adoption of measurably secure semiconductors and measurably secure semiconductors supply chains. </h4><p>A &#8220;Multilateral Semiconductors Security Fund&#8221; will be established by the Department of Treasury and administered by State to develop/promote secure semiconductor supply chains with allies. The Congressional intent here is that State use this money, in concert with US allies in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/business/european-union-china-deals.html">Europe</a> and <a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3115775/almost-half-japan-technology-firms-diversifying-supply-chains">Japan</a>, to de-risk semiconductor supply chains away from China. There is also language about promoting shared investment screening and export control standards among allies with respect to microelectronics.</p><h4>Sec. 9906. Advanced microelectronics research and development. </h4><ol><li><p>The National Science and Technology Council (part of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy) will write a national strategy on microelectronics </p></li><li><p>The Secretary of Commerce will establish:</p><ul><li><p>an industry technical advisory group for microelectronics (a <a href="https://tac.bis.doc.gov/">BIS TAC</a>);</p></li><li><p>a National Semiconductor Technology Center, which will function as a PPP, to promote R&amp;D in to semiconductor manufacturing equipment; </p></li></ul><ul><li><p>a National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program;</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>microelectronics research &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_USA">ManufacturingUSA</a> programs at NIST.</p></li></ul></li></ol><h4>Sec. 9908. Defense Production Act of 1950 efforts. </h4><p>The president will submit a report to Congress detailing how <a href="https://www.businessdefense.gov/DPA-Title-III/Overview/">DPA Title III</a> provisions (which give the President authority to ensure availability of domestic industrial resources essential to national security through economic incentives) may be used to support microelectronics production in the US.</p><h2>Trade Offs</h2><p>The aforementioned provisions are all good and the CHIPS Act is a commendable effort. With that said, below are some critiques and suggestions.</p><h4><strong>Fabrication &gt; Innovation</strong>: </h4><p>The way many of these incentives are structured belies a tacit emphasis on support for large existing semiconductor firms (ex. Intel, GlobalFoundries, AMAT) pursuing traditional metrics of innovation (chasing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law">Moore&#8217;s Law</a>). In general, the biggest winners are going to be companies that build fabs and the equipment that goes in fabs. Thats good - hardware is expensive. But there should be more of a focus on incentives for fabless companies doing innovative work as well as companies re-thinking how to make chips in general: ex. <a href="https://semiengineering.com/brighter-future-for-photonics/">photonics</a>, EDA vendors not named Cadence, Mentor, or Synopsys, open-source initiatives like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V">RISC-V</a>, and figuring out how to make lithography equipment in the US that can compete with <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2020/02/29/how-asml-became-chipmakings-biggest-monopoly">ASML</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Electron">TEL</a>.</p><h4><strong>Lack of Detail</strong>: </h4><p>The CHIPS Act provisions do not seem to incorporate specific recommendations of the many reports written about this industry in the last five years. To take just one example, the <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/PCAST/pcast_ensuring_long-term_us_leadership_in_semiconductors.pdf">PCAST report</a> put out at the end of the Obama Administration had detailed recommendations (see sections 3 &amp; 4) improving: workforce, pre-competitive research, fab permitting processes, new approaches to integrated circuit design, and moonshot challenges. Industry has provided <a href="https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SIA-SRC-Vision-Report-3.30.17.pdf">even more detailed</a> recommendations.</p><p>The Act also missed the opportunity to revive big-picture ideas like the <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/computing/242699-450mm-silicon-wafers-arent-happening-time-soon-major-consortium-collapses">Global 450 Consortium</a>. Leading edge chip manufacturing <a href="https://semiengineering.com/demand-picks-up-for-200mm/">transitioned</a> from 200mm to 300mm wafers in the mid 2000s. This allowed for more chips per wafer, enabling economies of scale that resulted in cost reductions <a href="https://www.icinsights.com/news/bulletins/Companies-Maximize-300mm-200mm-Wafers-Slow-Progress-On-450mm/">greater than 20% per unit area</a>. Yet there was no call out to incentivize pilot production at a US fab of 450mm wafers in the CHIPS Act. If not in this once-per-generation legislation, when? Maybe this will all be done by an implementing agency, but Congress could&#8217;ve just been explicit. </p><h4><strong>Analysis Paralysis</strong>: Too Many Reports</h4><p>The Act calls for myriad reports which will do nothing to directly help the industry, little to inform the government, and are certain to arrive at redundant conclusions. There are plenty of good reports on the <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R46581.pdf">state</a> <a href="https://legacy.trade.gov/topmarkets/semiconductors.asp">of</a> <a href="https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/working_papers/id_058_the_health_and_competitiveness_of_the_sme_industry_final_070219checked.pdf">the</a> <a href="https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2020/incentives-and-competitiveness-in-semiconductor-manufacturing">US</a> <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/trade/measuring-distortions-in-international-markets_8fe4491d-en">industry</a>, <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-16-185T">Defense</a> <a href="https://www.nscai.gov/reports">Department</a> <a href="https://www.ndia.org/divisions/working-groups/tmejwg">microelectronics</a> <a href="https://www.ida.org/-/media/feature/publications/s/se/semiconductor-industrial-base-focus-study--final-report/d-8294.ashx">needs</a>, and at <a href="https://potomacinstitute.org/images/studies/CARTSsm.pdf">the</a> <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/PCAST/pcast_ensuring_long-term_us_leadership_in_semiconductors.pdf">strategic</a> <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/National-Strategy-for-CET.pdf">level</a>. Yet Commerce, the Executive Office of the President, GAO, the NSTC, State, and DOD are all on the hook for reports.</p><p>In particular, Section 9904, which requires a Commerce Department industrial base survey/report, is duplicative and unimaginative. There are links to ten-plus chip industry reports sponsored by the US government and published since 2015 in the previous paragraph. The BIS website says they concluded a survey of this industry <a href="https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/office-of-technology-evaluation-ote/industrial-base-assessments">last year</a>. Its hard to believe BIS can draft, distribute, collect, and analyze a survey of all microelectronics firms in the US and then write a report that will offer information about the US microelectronics industry in 180 days thats <a href="https://www.semi.org/en/products-services/market-data/world-fab-forecast">not</a> <a href="https://www.vlsiresearch.com/">already</a> <a href="https://www.icinsights.com/services/mcclean-report/">available</a>.</p><h4><strong>Commerce Department &gt; Energy Department</strong>: </h4><p>More generally, the CHIPS Act overburdens the Commerce Department with a lot of deliverables. This is because Commerce has a lot of statutory authorities. But, &#8220;the department of everything else&#8221; doesn&#8217;t have the technical depth to do everything. Even though <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Industry_and_Security">BIS</a>, <a href="http://www.trade.gov/">ITA</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology">NIST</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office">USPTO</a> all have some microelectronics equities, Commerce doesn&#8217;t have the volume of technical experts needed to effectively administer these taskers. In contrast, The Energy Department has world-class technical talent and clear microelectronics-related equities (from <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-20-357">NNSA</a> to <a href="https://www.sandia.gov/mesa/">the national labs</a> to <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/07/12/2019-14869/request-for-information-basic-research-initiative-for-microelectronics">DOE-SC</a>), very few of whom get a direct call-out in the CHIPS Act.</p><h4><strong>Workforce Support Lacking</strong>: </h4><p>Except for a perfunctory call that the Secretaries of Labor and Energy coordinate with the National Academy of Sciences to support microelectronics workforce efforts, the CHIPS Act underemphasizes the most important thing this industry needs: a stable talent pipeline of electrical engineers, chemists, and physicists. This omission is strange because the original version of the Act had more explicit language on this issue (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/s3933/BILLS-116s3933is.pdf">section 5</a>). Specific requirements for affordable access to prototyping and low volume manufacturing (ex. modernizing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSIS">MOSIS</a> and expanding <a href="https://sunypoly.edu/research/albany-nanotech-complex">nanoFabs</a>), essential resources for training the next generation, are also lacking. </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Many of the critiques above may be mitigated depending on the competence and capability of the government agencies that actually implement this legislation. Or maybe these problems are addressed somewhere in the other 4,471 pages of the NDAA. But the more that CHIPS Act provisions delegate to Executive Branch and/or implementing agencies, the more Congress&#8217;s intent becomes subject to interpretation. A <a href="https://potomacinstitute.org/images/studies/CARTSsm.pdf">recent report</a> found that PPPs, such as the ones the CHIPS Act calls for, need to be funded at $200-300M/year at a total budget of $2-3B on a 10-year timeline. This CHIPS Act is a great start, but Congress needs to make sure its 2021 appropriations work matches the scope of the Act if the US is going to win this race by innovating faster.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>the views here are my own and drawn solely from the documents I cite here.</em></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Made in China 2025 and Semiconductors: A 2020 Progress Report]]></title><description><![CDATA[Its not half way there]]></description><link>https://semiliterate.substack.com/p/made-in-china-2025-and-semiconductors</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://semiliterate.substack.com/p/made-in-china-2025-and-semiconductors</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Semi-Literate]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 20 Dec 2020 19:00:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a292bd5-dae1-4ef6-a6c1-f38615756728_820x500.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLUF_(communication)">BLUF</a></strong>: Made in China 2025 and the National IC Plan (I will conflate the two for convenience and hereafter just refer to them as &#8220;MIC 2025&#8221;) are going to fall far, far short of the goal that China produce 70% of the semiconductors it consumes by 2025.

Optimistic industry <a href="https://www.icinsights.com/news/bulletins/China-To-Fall-Far-Short-Of-Its-MadeinChina-2025-Goal-For-IC-Devices/">estimates</a> suggest that China will produce less than 1/3rd that amount. The basic trade statistics are indicative of the larger story:</p><p>Between 2015 and 2019, Chinese trade in Integrated Circuits (ICs) grew from:</p><ul><li><p>Imports of $230 billion in 2015 to imports of $305 billion in 2019. </p></li><li><p>Exports of $70 billion in 2015 to exports $102 billion in 2019.</p></li></ul><p>Interestingly, the trade statistics also show China&#8217;s reliance on US supply of semiconductor goods increased significantly during this same time period, in spite of trade tensions:</p><ul><li><p>US exports of ICs to China grew from $4 billion in 2015 to $6.5 billion in 2019. </p></li><li><p>US exports of semiconductor manufacturing equipment doubled during this time period, growing from $1.65 billion to $3.5 billion. Data <a href="https://dataweb.usitc/">here</a>.</p></li></ul><p>China continues to consume far more chips than it can produce domestically. That trend shows no signs of stopping, and by some metrics is in fact increasing. There are three factors working against China&#8217;s goals for its semiconductor industry self sufficiency at this point:</p><ul><li><p>Math</p></li><li><p>Competition (more math)</p></li><li><p>Bankruptcies, debt, and trade wars</p></li></ul><h2>Math</h2><p>MIC2025 called for China to produce 40% of the semiconductors it consumed by 2020. <a href="https://www.icinsights.com/news/bulletins/China-To-Fall-Far-Short-Of-Its-MadeinChina-2025-Goal-For-IC-Devices/">It didn&#8217;t</a>. If you&#8217;re not even half way to 40% in 2020, 70% in 2025 looks awfully optimistic. Yet for some reason, China <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46581">raised</a> this target in 2019 and now wants to produce 80% of the semiconductors it consumes by 2030.</p><p>MIC2025 suffered from a lack of definitions: what is &#8220;Chinese&#8221; chip production?

Anyone who has looked at the numbers of fabs under construction/expansion in China and crunched the wafer starts per month (see below) can tell as we sit here at the end of 2020 that China is not going to produce 70% of the semiconductors it consumes in 2025. </p><h2>Competition:</h2><p>The list of the top 15 semiconductor sales leaders worldwide in <a href="https://www.icinsights.com/news/bulletins/Five-Top20-Companies-Forecast-To-Show-DoubleDigit-Growth-This-Year/">2015</a> and in <a href="https://www.icinsights.com/news/bulletins/Intel-To-Keep-Its-Number-One-Semiconductor-Supplier-Ranking-In-2020/">2020</a> is essentially unchanged (notable new entrants in 2020 include Apple and AMD).

Focus just on the yellow bars in the image above and its apparent where things stand: </p><ul><li><p>27% of installed capacity for wafer-starts-per-month for foundry and memory is coming from Chinese-headquartered companies. Put another way:</p></li><li><p>73% of &#8220;China&#8217;s&#8221; chip production is currently coming from non-Chinese companies operating factories in-country, and they&#8217;re doing it at more advanced nodes than their Chinese-headquartered competitors. </p></li></ul><p>This deficit is even more acute when the market share numbers are broken down for foundries and memory chip firms:</p><h3>Foundry</h3><p>From <a href="https://www.icinsights.com/news/bulletins/China-Forecast-To-Represent-22-Of-The-Foundry-Market-In-2020/">2018-20</a>, TSMC&#8217;s share of the China foundry market increased from 55% to 61% while UMC&#8217;s went from 7-17%. Meanwhile, over that same period of time, SMIC&#8217;s market share declined from 19% to 16% and Huahong&#8217;s was flat at 8%.</p><p>Chinese fabless firms still choose Taiwanese foundries over Chinese foundries. Taiwanese foundries&#8217; market share is growing while the Chinese foundries&#8217; market share is declining or flat. That pretty much says all you need to know about how China&#8217;s domestic foundries are doing.</p><h3>Memory</h3><p>The news on the memory side of the industry is slightly better for China, with YMTC and CXMT beginning honest-to-God commercial production of memory chips 2020. But again, these numbers are behind schedule and much lower than China hoped for. A helpful reality check comes from <a href="https://www.icinsights.com/news/bulletins/China-To-Fall-Far-Short-Of-Its-MadeinChina-2025-Goal-For-IC-Devices/">IC Insights</a> earlier this year: </p><blockquote><p>CXMT began limited production of its first DRAM products in 4Q19. This company has a few thousand employees and a capital spending budget of about $1.5 billion per year. In contrast, Micron and SK Hynix each have well over 30,000 employees and Samsung&#8217;s memory division is estimated to have over 40,000. Moreover, in 2019, the combined capital spending from Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron was $39.7 billion.</p></blockquote><p>The high points of China&#8217;s semiconductor industry in 2020 are all non-Chinese firms that have factories in China: Samsung (S. Korea), SK Hynix (S. Korea), Intel (US, soon to be owned by Hynix), TSMC (Taiwan), and UMC (Taiwan).</p><h2>Bankruptcies, debt, and trade wars</h2><p>China&#8217;s semiconductor sector has seen a string of high-profile bankruptcies in 2020, all of which are ringing alarm bells about the sustainability of the government&#8217;s support for the industry. These alarm bells are probably unfounded; the Chinese government is never going to stop throwing money at this industry to facilitate its domestic growth, development, and sustainability. But these losses show that they&#8217;re going to lose a ton of money in the process.</p><h3>Bankruptcies and Debt</h3><p>There have been six notable bankruptcies, four of which stand out in that they were clearly partnering with/poaching personnel from some of the best in the business and for one reason or another it just didn&#8217;t work out:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Caixin/Chinese-2.8bn-memory-chip-project-goes-bust">Tacoma Semiconductor Technology</a>: Nanjing-based Joint Venture (JV) with TowerJazz (Israel), filed for bankruptcy in July 2020.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://technode.com/2020/09/09/hsmc-promised-chinaa-first-7-nm-chips-it-didnt-go-well/">Wuhan Hongxin Semiconductor Manufacturing</a>: Wuhan-based and headed by the former COO of TSMC, closed in 2020.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3085230/us-semiconductor-giant-shuts-china-factory-hailed-miracle">GexinIntegrated Circuit Manufacturing</a>: Chengdu-based JV with GlobalFoundries (US), closed in July 2019.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-qualcomm-jointventure/qualcomms-joint-venture-with-chinese-province-to-shut-down-the-information-idUSKCN1RV0CD">Huaxintong Semitech Co. Ltd.</a>: JV with Qualcomm (US), shut down in April 2019.</p></li><li><p>Huaian Imaging Device Manufacturer</p></li><li><p>Shaanxi Kuntong Semiconductor Technology</p></li></ul><p>This is on top of the <a href="https://semiliterate.substack.com/p/tsinghua-unigroup-falls-and-chinas">mounting debt troubles facing Tsinghua Unigroup</a>, China&#8217;s national champion for all-things semiconductor, which doesn&#8217;t look like it will end well:</p><blockquote><p>A shotgun marriage involving a Chinese SOE stepping in to rescue a Chinese national champion [Unigroup] is certainly not the outcome Beijing had in mind for one of the leading lights of its semiconductor industry. Though Beijing is clearly committed to supporting the semiconductor industry in the long-term, Unigroup&#8217;s struggles are just another reminder that it has yet to figure out how to win in this industry in the short term.</p></blockquote><h3>Trade Wars</h3><p>In addition, several notable Chinese semiconductor firms have been caught in the trade war. This isn&#8217;t a death knell necessarily, but the US actions <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/960f37c4-fcc5-44d0-b4ac-57ea75c6f73d">certainly dont help</a>.</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-sanctions-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-to-blacklist-dozens-of-chinese-firms-including-smic-sources-say-idUSKBN28S0HL">SMIC</a>: The news this week wasn&#8217;t great for SMIC, but it also wasn&#8217;t the end. Keeping SMIC from manufacturing &lt;10nm and below doesnt mean much when they only just got their <a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2020/08/13/smic-says-it-has-improved-the-yield-rate-of-its-14nm-manufacturing-node/">14nm FinFET to commercial yields</a>. SMIC is years away from 10nm so the new rule doesnt effect their day to day. Honestly, if I&#8217;m SMIC, I feel like I got off lucky compared to what the US government has done to other Chinese chip firms. In a way, its actually a fantastic excuse to end their <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/994bca54-7212-11e9-bf5c-6eeb837566c5">internal debate</a> over whether to pursue profits or state demands for cutting-edge technology. Clearly cutting-edge is out of the question.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/17/us-to-tighten-restrictions-on-huawei-access-to-technology-chips-sources-say.html">HiSilicon/Huawei</a>: it took the US government a while to craft a rule that had teeth, but the fact that HiSilicon cant partner with TSMC (or any other fab filled with American-origin semiconductor manufacturing equipment) and use American-origin EDA tools to design their chips is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/9/21360598/huawei-chips-us-sanctions-trump-china-privacy-smartphone">a death-knell for now</a>. </p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/gear/article/3107531/taiwans-umc-aid-us-pursuit-chinese-chip-maker-fujian-jinhua-over-alleged">Fujian Jinhua </a>(JHICC): The lesson with Jinhua is simple - dont brazenly steal chip IP from Micron (/any US chip firm) or the DOJ will build a case, flip your former collaborators, and put you out of business. One under-appreciated aspect of this case: UMC&#8217;s decision to cooperate with US authorities against Jinhua seems to indicate they value business coming from US fabless companies &gt; business coming from Chinese fabless companies and keeping the US more happy than the CCP.</p></li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Everything described above should paint a very humbling picture for China. After five years, the sole point of optimism for MIC 2025&#8217;s semiconductor aspirations is in memory chips. And even here, China is behind schedule, over budget, and below yield. Memory was supposed to be the easy part. At this rate, it will take decades for China to become competitive outside of memory chips. </p><p>A few concluding notes of caution:</p><ul><li><p>These numbers show huge huge demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment in China and if the leading U.S. firms (KLA, AMAT, Lam) are to maintain their leading position in the industry they are going to need to be able to sell to China.</p></li><li><p>China is in this for the long haul. Five years of false starts and slow progress mean little in the eyes of policymakers who are thinking about this industry on a 50-year time horizon.</p></li></ul><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: These views are my own and drawn from the material I cite. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tsinghua Unigroup Struggles and China's Chip Ambitions Stumble]]></title><description><![CDATA[What happens when a national champion cant get a break?]]></description><link>https://semiliterate.substack.com/p/tsinghua-unigroup-falls-and-chinas</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://semiliterate.substack.com/p/tsinghua-unigroup-falls-and-chinas</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Semi-Literate]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 10 Dec 2020 17:39:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F658e1b92-ac75-4ba4-a27b-f6c9818f39e5_1024x512.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLUF_(communication)">BLUF</a>: Tsinghua Unigroup was initially supposed to create a Chinese rival to MediaTek or Qualcomm.

A subsidiary of Tsinghua Holdings (which is itself a subsidiary of Tsinghua University, China&#8217;s MIT and Xi Jinping&#8217;s alma mater), Unigroup has been endowed with seemingly limitless funds to purchase leading international semiconductor companies and invest in domestic firms, working to accelerate the pace of the Chinese semiconductor industry&#8217;s progress as its most visible national champion. A <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/trade/measuring-distortions-in-international-markets_8fe4491d-en">report by the OECD</a> last year estimated that total Chinese government support for Tsinghua Unigroup exceeded 30% of its consolidated revenue.</p><h2>Buying Spree</h2><p>Using its unique political and economic heft, Unigroup went on a buying spree in the mid 2010s: it purchased Spreadtrum in 2013 and RDA Microelectronics in 2014, combing the two companies in to UNISOC, an entity that designs chips for mobile devices and was supposed to challenge MediaTek (Taiwan) and Qualcomm&#8217;s (US) dominance in the sector. Intel (US) <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/intel-ends-unisoc-deal-so-it-can-work-directly-with-chinese-oems/">owned a stake</a> in UNISOC for several years targeting Chinese 5G before dissolving the partnership in 2019 in a sign UNISOC&#8217;s efforts were not going to happen on time/on budget.</p><p>In 2015 Unigroup also <a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4054956">apparently tried to buy a stake in</a> the Taiwanese foundry industry. Unigroup chairman Zhao Weiguo allegedly approached TSMC&#8217;s founder Morris Chang with an offer to buy a stake in TSMC, to which Chang said &#8220;I am afraid you cant afford it.&#8221; This story is of-course apocryphal, but speaks to both Unigroup&#8217;s ambitions and TSMC&#8217;s position of strength in the industry: China&#8217;s national champion clearly recognized TSMC&#8217;s importance and wanted a piece of the action. And TSMC was in a position of such strength that it could simply say &#8220;no.&#8221;</p><p>After initially focusing its efforts on chip design, Unigroup then pivoted to the semiconductor fabrication business and focused its sights on memory chips. It made a $23 billion bid for <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-micron-m-a-tsinghua-exclusive/exclusive-micron-does-not-believe-deal-with-tsinghua-is-possible-sources-idUSKCN0PU1X120150721">Micron</a> in 2015 and an offer to buy 15% of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c235a154-da37-11e5-98fd-06d75973fe09">Western Digital</a> in 2016. After those investments were blocked by the US government, Unigroup turned its sights to <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/trade/measuring-distortions-in-international-markets_8fe4491d-en">Chinese memory chip companies</a>, &#8220;collaborating with local governments and the National IC Fund to invest in the construction of new memory fabs in Chengdu (Sichuan), Chongqing, Nanjing (Jiangsu), and Wuhan (Hubei).&#8221; Notable investments include: <a href="https://technode.com/2020/04/23/ymtc-memory-chip/">Yangtze Memory Technologies</a>, <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/14607/fourth-chinese-dram-company-established-by-tsinghua-unigroup">Xi&#8217;an UnilC Semiconductor</a>, and more recently announcing a <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Trade-war/China-s-Tsinghua-Unigroup-to-break-ground-on-chip-plant-this-year">DRAM</a> project in June 2020. These investments and others Unigroup made in to Unisplendour, Guoxin Micro, and Linxens have seen mixed success (YMTC being the notable success story).</p><h2>The Good Times Are Over</h2><p>In November 2019 Unigroup <a href="https://bondevalue.com/news/state-backed-chinese-chipmaker-tsinghua-unigroups-bonds-selloff-highlighting-investor-concerns/">experienced a bond selloff</a> due to investor fears over the amount of debt it was taking on. A year later, and these concerns <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Markets/China-debt-crunch/China-s-Tsinghua-Unigroup-bond-crisis-deepens-with-second-default">seem to be justified</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Chinese chipmaker Tsinghua Unigroup is to default on $2.5 billion of offshore bonds after failing to meet a Thursday [December 9, 2020] deadline to repay a $450 million Eurobond, while also missing an interest payment on one of its onshore bonds.</p></blockquote><p>This bad news is compounded by a ~<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-unigroup-default/chinas-tsinghua-unigroup-defaults-on-198-million-bond-sources-idUSKBN27X0CO">$200 million bond default</a> in November.

These concerns also speak to the strength of the US industry: US SME firms are best-in-class and China wants to buy as much SME as possible from them. </p><p>The US government can and should limit these sales, but should be careful not to unduly harm US SME firms lest they choose to off-shore manufacturing to avoid controls they perceive as too burdensome. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9efc048c-0007-427c-be8a-3e390d99db5c_750x288.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9efc048c-0007-427c-be8a-3e390d99db5c_750x288.jpeg" width="750" height="288" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9efc048c-0007-427c-be8a-3e390d99db5c_750x288.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:288,&quot;width&quot;:750,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:122219,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9efc048c-0007-427c-be8a-3e390d99db5c_750x288.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9efc048c-0007-427c-be8a-3e390d99db5c_750x288.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9efc048c-0007-427c-be8a-3e390d99db5c_750x288.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9efc048c-0007-427c-be8a-3e390d99db5c_750x288.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><h2>Background: US Export Controls on SME and China </h2><p>For background, quoting from an (excellent) <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/U.S.-Semiconductor-Exports-to-China-Current-Policies-and-Trends.pdf">CSET report on the subject</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Currently, the United States applies multiple types of semiconductor export controls on China. &#8220;List-based controls&#8221; is a term of art that refers to a list of specific technologies whose export is controlled. &#8220;End-use and end-user controls&#8221; refer to lists of prohibited end-uses for exported technologies and end-users that cannot receive exports. To export any controlled items, exporters must obtain export licenses&#8212;which can be denied by licensing officers.</p></blockquote><p>Controls on exports of US SME cover &#8220;some types of lithography, deposition, ion implanting, testing, and wafer handling tools, but not etching, process control, assembly, and wafer manufacturing tools.&#8221; Yet US licensing policy has been quite permissive until recently, allowing China to buy nearly any equipment it wanted from US firms. </p><p>The <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/U.S.-Semiconductor-Exports-to-China-Current-Policies-and-Trends.pdf">CSET report</a> (see p. 21/22) has some shocking numbers: US exports of SME to China doubled between 2014-19, yet in 2018 only seven SME license applications were filed and all were approved. <em>Translation</em>: US SME firms sold hundreds (likely thousands) of pieces of SME to China during this time worth $billions, almost all of it did not require an export control license application, and even those sales that did require a license were nearly always granted approval, upon review. </p><h2>The View from DC</h2><p>The view from DC with regard to (w/r/t) export controls on SME has changed dramatically in the last three years (mainly due to <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN10924/4">FIRRMA/ECRA</a>), and now views this permissive policy as a mistake. The temptation is to swing licensing policy hard in the opposite direction and start clamping down on sales of a broad swath of US-origin SME to a broad list of end users (Chinese customers) and end uses (applications such as supercomputing, surveillance etc). But there seems to be an emerging consensus that US controls on SME be limited and targeted.</p><p>Writ-large, the current view might be summarized as &#8220;given that the US government has decided its necessary to put controls on exports of SME to China, those controls should be limited (A) to select pieces of advanced equipment and (B) to select end-users/end-uses (C) in coordination with allied countries who are home to SME companies that could otherwise fill the void of US supply.&#8221; </p><p>This A/B/C view reflects several realities and challenges:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Point A</strong>: key technological <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/CSET-Maintaining-the-AI-Chip-Competitive-Advantage-of-the-United-States-and-its-Allies-20191206.pdf">chokepoints</a> (sole-source suppliers) exist for extreme ultraviolet lithography tools, argon fluoride immersion photolithography tools, and a lot of metrology/inspection tools. Generally speaking, its possible to know which tools are used to make the best chips and which are used to make &#8220;the rest.&#8221; The industry would argue controls should only be applied to the former and they should be allowed to continue to sell the latter to any and all Chinese firms. However the decision to sell or not to sell some of this equipment is out of the hands of the US government: EUV tools, for example, are not made in the US (I&#8217;ll spare well-versed readers the rehash of <a href="https://www.asml.com/en/news/press-releases/asml-to-acquire-cymer-to-accelerate-development-of-euv-technology-(47397)">Cymer, ASML</a>, &amp; <a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=973be404-98ea-494e-937f-c91b34f221f6">FDPR</a> debate for now). </p></li><li><p><strong>Point B</strong>: US SME firms rely on sales to the Chinese market to fund the R&amp;D needed to maintain their leading position in this industry. Loss of sales = loss of lead. There is a real risk that Applied Materials, KLA, and/or Lam Research off-shore some of their production to work around export controls they deem unduly onerous. KLA has already <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4343405-kla-corporation-klac-ceo-rick-wallace-on-q1-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single">made comments</a> to this effect. The fewer end-users (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/26/technology/trump-china-smic-blacklist.html">SMIC</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/business/economy/commerce-department-huawei.html">HiSilicon</a>) and end-uses (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/22/technology/china-intel-nvidia-xinjiang.html">like surveillance equipment in Xinjiang using US chips</a>) subject to new licensing requirements/export controls, the better in the eyes of US industry.</p></li><li><p><strong>Point C</strong>: There is widespread foreign availability of nearly all SME, though a big difference exists between the best-in-class producers and the rest. This foreign availability means that, in the event that US companies like Applied Materials, KLA, and Lam Research were unilaterally prevented from selling to Chinese firms, companies in Taiwan, South Korea, Europe, and Japan could fill the void to some extent and would happily sell to China, absent pressure against doing so from their own governments.</p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6fd1a04-4367-403d-bc82-4d841fc61991_440x220.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6fd1a04-4367-403d-bc82-4d841fc61991_440x220.jpeg" width="440" height="220" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b6fd1a04-4367-403d-bc82-4d841fc61991_440x220.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:220,&quot;width&quot;:440,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:57420,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6fd1a04-4367-403d-bc82-4d841fc61991_440x220.jpeg 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6fd1a04-4367-403d-bc82-4d841fc61991_440x220.jpeg 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6fd1a04-4367-403d-bc82-4d841fc61991_440x220.jpeg 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6fd1a04-4367-403d-bc82-4d841fc61991_440x220.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">US government agencies with export control authorities include Defense (DTSA), Commerce (BIS), State (DDTC), and Energy.</figcaption></figure></div><h2>The View from Government:</h2><p>A GAO <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-02-620">report</a> from 2002 found that export controls on SME to China, even when multilateralized through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wassenaar_Arrangement">The Wassenaar Arrangement</a>, were ineffective because the US was the only country that voluntarily implemented them. A follow up <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-08-1095">report</a> from 2008 found that focusing controls on end-users in China was also ineffective. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) Assistant Secretary from 2010-17 echoes this conclusion in recent <a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Wolf%20Testimony%206-4-19.pdf">testimony</a>. Additionally, in 2015 BIS <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/02/09/2015-02681/foreign-availability-determination-anisotropic-plasma-dry-etching-equipment">determined</a>: &#8220;foreign availability exists for anisotropic plasma dry etching equipment controlled for national security reasons,&#8221; particularly in China, and determined that it should lift controls. More recently, the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wkPh8Gb5drBrKBg6OhGu5oNaTEERbKss/view">National Security Commission on AI</a> recommended multilateral export controls on SME. </p><p>The House GOP&#8217;s 2020 China Task Force <a href="https://gop-foreignaffairs.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CHINA-TASK-FORCE-REPORT-FINAL-9.30.20.pdf">report</a>, while generally dismissive of the effectiveness of Wassenaar, recommends that the US engage allied partners (presumably Japan and the Netherlands) to apply controls on SME.</p><p><strong>In Sum</strong>: it seems like subject matter experts in government recognize multilateral export controls on SME are the way to go. There is widespread foreign availability of most SME, so unilateral controls will do nothing more than harm domestic industry sales if they&#8217;re not coordinated with allied countries. BIS seems to be acting under this paradigm, <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/10/05/2020-18334/implementation-of-certain-new-controls-on-emerging-technologies-agreed-at-wassenaar-arrangement-2019">focusing multilateral controls</a> on SME-related goods solely at advanced node manufacturing in October 2020 (5nm in this case).</p><h2>The View from Industry:</h2><p>The US SME firms make several reoccurring points when asked about the effect of new export controls on their industry. Recent <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=BIS-2020-0029-0032">comments</a> from Cadence Design Systems (an EDA tool vendor) are indicative:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Foreign Availability</strong>: There is widespread foreign availability of most SME, so unilateral controls that just prevent US firms from selling to China would simply push business to their competition. This loss of business would harm their R&amp;D/innovation efforts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trade Diversion</strong>: The US SME industry has a global footprint and many firms have overseas subsidiaries. US SME firms may choose to re-orient their supply chains to increase overseas production to avoid a US government clamp-down on firm sales to China from the US branch of the company. </p></li><li><p><strong>Competition</strong>: Unilateral controls on SME will incentivize China to subsidize production of indigenous SME companies, and incentivize Chinese firms to seek other suppliers/avoid purchasing from US suppliers as retribution. Both actions would hurt US SME competitiveness.</p></li></ul><p>These points have been made by industry for several years. Lam Research, in comments on the 2018 BIS ANPRM on emerging technologies, <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=BIS-2018-0024-0206">said</a> unilateral controls would have no impact on the ability of non-US companies to develop products comparable to theirs because there is current foreign availability for all of their technologies.

Broad export controls on categories of equipment, targeting an indiscriminate number of end users/end uses, and without allies, will hurt the US SME industry more than it hurts the target and may push US SME firms to offshore manufacturing.</p><p>A more interesting debate, which does not appear to be happening, is whether the export control system is the correct means to achieve the desired ends of the US government to hold back China&#8217;s technological ambitions. Financial sanctions (which can directly cut a target a firm off from all dollar-denominated transactions world wide) would achieve these goals more effectively, but there are considerable tradeoffs.</p><p><em><strong>Note</strong></em>: these views are my own and informed solely by the information cited.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Can't China Just Reverse Engineer Chips?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Or, "How to Arrange Something with 20,000,000,000,000 parts."]]></description><link>https://semiliterate.substack.com/p/why-cant-china-just-reverse-engineer</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://semiliterate.substack.com/p/why-cant-china-just-reverse-engineer</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Semi-Literate]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 29 Nov 2020 15:14:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98da037c-d571-4de1-b46e-0c674499bd7a_1920x1080.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLUF_(communication)">BLUF</a></strong>: It is hard to conceptualize just how complicated it is to make chips.

A month later, Intel announced it had a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/07/as-7nm-schedule-continues-slipping-intel-contemplates-3rd-party-fabs/">process-slip</a> which meant its 10nm chips, already delayed, would arrive a full year later than forecast. Then in August it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/intel-agrees-to-sell-its-nand-business-to-sk-hynix-for-9-billion/">divested</a> its NAND memory business to SK Hynix after years of struggles. Meanwhile, competitors like AMD and NVIDIA have been on an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amd-nvidia-chip-away-at-intels-semiconductor-dominance-11603909252">absolute tear</a>, leveraging high stock prices to acquire Xilinx (AMD) and ARM (NVIDIA) which will cement their competitiveness in the industry, if approved.</p><p>Intel&#8217;s struggles at 10nm have meant the United States no longer has domestic state of the art manufacturing capabilities, as TSMC and Samsung have pushed <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16042/tsmc-we-have-50-of-all-euv-installations-60-wafer-capacity">the leading edge</a> to 5nm manufacturing at some of their fabs in Taiwan and South Korea. This is troubling for consumer electronics companies in the U.S. that hoped Intel would provide an alternative to their reliance on TSMC for advanced chip manufacturing. Intel&#8217;s struggles at 10nm are also troubling for the U.S. government, which <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-semiconductors/u-s-lawmakers-propose-22-8-billion-in-aid-to-semiconductor-industry-idUSKBN23H39M">likes</a> the idea of having commercially viable domestic advanced semiconductor manufacturing for economic and national security reasons and generally hates the idea of Intel ending up like the next IBM. </p><h2>The Ugly</h2><p>So, if you&#8217;re the U.S. government and you see a Fortune 100 chipmaker thats hit a rough patch, what are your options?</p><ul><li><p><strong>Do nothing</strong>: this is the approach the US government adopted when it was clear IBM&#8217;s microelectronics business was in decline. The result was IBM <a href="https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/45110.wss">sold</a> their fabs to GlobalFoundries which, though US-based, is owned by Abu Dhabi&#8217;s Mubadala Investment Company. GloFo has had plenty of struggles of its own since then, trying and then <a href="https://www.eetimes.com/globalfoundries-halts-7nm-work/">giving-up</a> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_ultraviolet_lithography">EUV</a> and sub -12nm manufacturing and <a href="https://www.globalfoundries.com/news-events/press-releases/semiconductor-and-globalfoundries-partner-transfer-ownership-east">selling off</a> one of its fabs to ON Semi last year. Suffice to say, a foreign buyer acquiring advanced microelectronics manufacturing assets, failing to maintain the investment level needed to stay at the leading edge, and then divesting some of those assets, is not an outcome policymakers want to see again.</p></li><li><p><strong>Money</strong>: fabs are expensive. Sub-10nm fabs are <a href="https://semiwiki.com/semiconductor-manufacturers/tsmc/285846-cost-analysis-of-the-proposed-tsmc-us-fab/">tremendously expensive</a>. If your goal as a policymaker is secure (Made in the USA by a USA-headquartered company) commercially viable leading-edge microelectronics manufacturing, giving money to Intel to re-tool a fab is basically your only option. The government&#8217;s of China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan have all found <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/trade/measuring-distortions-in-international-markets_8fe4491d-en">creative and WTO-permissible</a> ways to subsidize their chip industries. Perhaps its time to get creative. <a href="https://www.eetimes.com/chips-act-targets-post-globalized-industry/">The CHIPS Act</a> is a good start, but grants of up to $3 billion for new fabs don&#8217;t move the needle long-term. Before giving up on the idea, GloFo <a href="https://www.eetimes.com/globalfoundries-halts-7nm-work/">estimated</a> just getting from 14nm to 7nm would cost that much. Meanwhile Samsung is talking about spending <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/samsung-intensifies-chip-wars-with-bet-it-can-catch-tsmc-by-2022">$116 billion</a> in the coming years to catch TSMC, which is spending $17 billion annually to maintain their lead. These numbers are just impossible to comprehend. $116 billion is larger than the nominal GDP of 127 countries according to the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?year_high_desc=true">World Bank</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Break up</strong>: theres been a little chatter about breaking off Intel&#8217;s non-core businesses and in fact, it sold off several in just the past year. In addition to the aforementioned sales of the smartphone modem and NAND memory units, Intel also <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/mediatek_purchases_power_management_chip_business_from_intel-news-46308.php">sold off</a> its power management chip business in November 2020. There&#8217;s also been some <a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2020/10/29/should-intel-split-in-two/">highly speculative talk</a> about Intel splitting off its manufacturing assets into a standalone company - lets call them &#8220;IntelFoundry.&#8221; This decision would run in to a million commercial challenges, and there isnt much role for policymakers in this scenario, but its an interesting thought experiment and brings us to the next option:</p></li><li><p><strong>Marriage</strong>: This is a sort of choose-your-own-adventure two-part hypothetical: </p><ul><li><p>In <em>Option #1</em>: IntelFoundry merges with GloFo and/or <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/willyshih/2020/10/28/skywater-technology-and-domestic-production-of-semiconductors/?sh=439917ec3b34">SkyWater</a> to create a sort of national champion for advanced microelectronics manufacturing in the United States, one that gets below 10nm and focuses more on servicing the military/aerospace chip market than Intel has traditionally.  Theoretically policymakers have some role in this insofar as GloFo and SkyWater both <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/GlobalFoundries-increases-DOD-chip-contract-by-15732965.php">proudly</a> do <a href="https://finance-commerce.com/2019/10/skywater-growth-backed-by-170-million-from-dod/">business</a> with the US government and a tie up between any/all of these companies could be facilitated by US government purchase commitments, tax breaks, expedited anti-trust reviews, etc.</p></li><li><p>In <em>Option #2</em>: Intel sells-off IntelFoundry to any one of the big tech companies that are sitting on mountains of cash and seem to be <a href="https://em360tech.com/tech-news/big-tech-companies-building-custom-chips-ai">increasingly</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/11/18220436/google-pixel-ai-chips-team-division-bengaluru-india-hiring">interested</a> in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-is-the-newest-chip-giant-in-town-11592910000">vertical integration</a> of their silicon-oriented business units.</p></li></ul><p>Both of these scenarios sound nice on paper, which should give the reader pause. Its not really clear what IntelFoundry gains by partnering with firms like GloFo or SkyWater that are behind them technologically besides potential economies of scale many years down the road and exposure to a Mil/Aero market that is notoriously unprofitable relative to consumer electronic sales. There are also myriad commercial reasons why these ideas are bad and/or exceedingly unlikely: economies of scale being disrupted, chip design/manufacturing feedback loops broken, earning the trust of new customers etc. Also, would Apple/Amazon/Google/Microsoft really want to run fabs? It seems unlikely policymakers wade in to this hypothetical morass. Which brings us to our final option:</p></li><li><p><strong>IntelFoundry:</strong> The final option is a standalone business unit within Intel that specifically makes chips for third-party customers. This option is different from the Break-up scenario above in that IntelFoundry would operate <em>in addition</em> to Intel&#8217;s existing manufacturing assets. This paradigm exists: Samsung operates factories for its in-house chip fabrication needs but Samsung Foundry also takes orders from third-parties, including some competitors of Samsung&#8217;s. The US government is clearly <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-and-chip-makers-including-intel-seek-semiconductor-self-sufficiency-11589103002">very keen</a> on this option and in late April 2020 Intel&#8217;s CEO sent a letter to the Pentagon <a href="https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/intel%20letter.pdf">saying</a> &#8220;we want to make a foundry.&#8221; The fact that this letter was sent to the Pentagon indicates (1) DOD interest in securing advanced microelectronics manufacturing in the United States and (2) Intel&#8217;s commitment: DOD is really the only game in town when it comes to funding projects of this magnitude. It is currently funding a multi-billion dollar <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/electronics-resurgence-initiative">Electronics Resurgence Initiative</a> and partnering with Intel in <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-wins-us-government-advanced-packaging-project/#gs.lttfem">other areas</a>.</p></li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Its obvious the US doesn&#8217;t want Intel to be the next IBM. But policymakers&#8217; options to preclude that fate are limited right now to throwing money at the problem (a public private partnership, a tax credit, or straight cash, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-and-chip-makers-including-intel-seek-semiconductor-self-sufficiency-11589103002">apparently</a>) and hoping something sticks. This is a failure of imagination, a failure to understand the history of this industry, and a failure to understand Intel&#8217;s comparative advantages. We&#8217;ll tackle all that in a later post.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>:&nbsp;<em>The views here are my own and are drawn from the publicly available information cited.</em></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Purpose]]></title><description><![CDATA[BLUF: The purpose of this blog is to make all of us a little better informed (you might even say &#8220;semi-literate&#8221;) about the state of the semiconductor industry.
