I like to read these reports to see how these businesses may be thinking about ecommerce specifically and to internalize how quickly they are growing and what that might mean for their customers, like ecommerce businesses, who are looking to grow their businesses via these channels. </p><p>What are the observations?</p><ul><li><p><strong>Google Search</strong> continues to grow very quickly despite its scale. It&#8217;s impressive when you compare the respective growth rates of these businesses. I would guess that Google is benefitting tremendously from the Apple privacy changes. Google Search is &#8220;pull-based&#8221;, meaning someone shares some intent and then ads are show around that specific intent. For example, if I search shoes, an ad for Nike shoes may appear. This is different than Facebook which has a &#8220;push-based&#8221; ad model. You go to Facebook to consume content shared by friends, family, and creators. Facebook has to guess what kinds of ads they should put in between that you might find appealing. The more they know about you, the better a job they can do. Especially when they know what ads you&#8217;ve clicked on and purchased from in the past. But it&#8217;s specifically this that has been disabled by Apple&#8217;s changes which is a big headwind to ad performance on Facebook.</p></li><li><p><strong>Facebook</strong> saw decent growth this quarter but guided to muted growth of 3-11% in Q1 2022. Facebook cites a few trends as headwinds to grow its advertising business: </p><ul><li><p>Increasing competition for users time and a shift of engagement towards video surfaces like Reels, which monetize at lower rates than Feed and Stories. (<em>I inferred from this that Facebook sees TikTok as an ever growing threat.</em>)</p></li><li><p>Ad targeting and measurement headwinds from platform and regulatory changes.</p></li><li><p>Macroeconomic challenges like cost inflation and supply chain disruptions may impact advertiser budgets.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Amazon</strong> broke out advertising as a separate business unit for the first time. It&#8217;s impressive scale for a business line that is only a few years old. It&#8217;s no surprise though given how prominent sponsored results have become on Amazon. The results to just about every query show sponsored items before organically ranked ones. This ad model is very similar to Google&#8217;s in that it is &#8220;pull-based&#8221;. It&#8217;s amazing to me that this ad rollout isn&#8217;t degrading the Amazon customer experience. It shows to me that Amazon&#8217;s core value proposition to customers is cost, speed, and reliability of delivery, not the ease of discovery and quality of product recommendations. This may be an open opportunity for a new commerce experience.</p></li><li><p><strong>YouTube</strong> advertising continues to grow nicely for Google. However, YouTube also called out the trend towards shorter-form video as something that they need to adapt to, likely due to the threat posed by TikTok. YouTube is also focused on enabling commerce:</p><ul><li><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re making it easier for viewers to buy what they see - and simpler for advertisers to drive action with innovative solutions like product feeds in Video Action Campaigns and emerging formats like live commerce.&#8221;</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Snap</strong> had a record quarter in that it generated &gt;$1B revenue for the first time and also posted a profit. Snap&#8217;s ad revenue is &#8220;push-based&#8221; and should theoretically see similar challenges to Facebook. The Snap management team put a lot of emphasis on continuing to work around the Apple privacy changes but admitted that it affects them less as Snap monetizes users at a much lower rate than Facebook and is much earlier on in its monetization journey. Similar to Facebook and YouTube, the Snap team called out the looming threat from TikTok and shared this specific note:</p><ul><li><p>&#8220;TikTok is a unique challenge in that they have a privileged and protected position in the Chinese market that Instagram or Facebook or Google or us aren&#8217;t allowed to access.

Prologis&#8217; origin lies in Abbey, Moghadam, and Burke Property Corporation (AMB), a real estate investment company founded in 1983 by Hamid Moghadam, who is CEO of Prologis today. Originally, this real estate business invested in office, industrial, and community shopping centers. In 1999, the company shifted its focus to industrial real estate exclusively. The reason for this shift is an interesting one. Hamid met the CEO of Webvan, the Instacart of the late 90&#8217;s, and in it saw a preview of the future. From a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/samanthasharf/2017/11/21/amazons-landlord-how-the-e-commerce-boom-propelled-warehouse-king-prologis-to-new-heights/?sh=772c89404bd9">Forbes profile</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Prologis' ecommerce strategy dates in one way or another to 1998, when Moghadam met the bookstore entrepreneur Louis Borders, who was raising money for the online grocer (and soon-to-be dot-com-bubble poster child) Webvan. Moghadam was then running Prologis' precursor, AMB Property Corp., which invested $5 million in Webvan, built it 3 warehouses and divested a $1B retail portfolio, plowing the proceeds into more industrial space. That $5M briefly swelled to $55M before crashing to nothing. But the loss had a big silver lining: Moghadam's billion-dollar bet on warehouses formed the backbone of Prologis' current portfolio. &#8220;Webvan opened our eyes to the possibility of e-commerce very early,&#8221; says the 61-year-old Moghadam."</p></blockquote><p>A few years after the strategy shift to industrial, AMB became the largest owner of warehouses in the US. Frequently, additions to the portfolio took the form of land purchases with AMB building warehouses itself on top. Later, AMB leaned into M&amp;A to accelerate its portfolio growth. After a merger in 2011, AMB was renamed Prologis.</p><p>Webvan didn&#8217;t turn out to be a stellar tenant for Prologis, but Prologis certainly made up for it in their relationships with Amazon (its largest tenant), Fedex, Walmart, Home Depot, and others. With those businesses growing (and especially their ecommerce businesses), the need for Prologis as a provider of warehouse space grew tremendously. Fast forward to today, Prologis manages 1B+ square feet of warehouse space, up from 670M square feet in 2016. Their real estate footprint spans 19 countries. To a degree, it can be said that Prologis is Amazon&#8217;s landlord. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a0e2cf9-a717-4e78-bef0-174f06034332_704x520.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a0e2cf9-a717-4e78-bef0-174f06034332_704x520.png" width="704" height="520" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8a0e2cf9-a717-4e78-bef0-174f06034332_704x520.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:520,&quot;width&quot;:704,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:105717,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a0e2cf9-a717-4e78-bef0-174f06034332_704x520.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a0e2cf9-a717-4e78-bef0-174f06034332_704x520.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a0e2cf9-a717-4e78-bef0-174f06034332_704x520.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a0e2cf9-a717-4e78-bef0-174f06034332_704x520.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Is it good business to be Amazon&#8217;s landlord?

Shouldn&#8217;t they own their own warehouses? There are a few reason why Prologis has become a key partner to them instead:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Exclusive supply. </strong>Prologis was early to the gold rush. They either acquired or built prime facilities in heavy trade geographies before intense competition emerged. Now, everyone wants warehouse space outside of major metros like San Francisco, but it&#8217;s very hard to find.</p></li><li><p><strong>Purpose built for the warehouse business.</strong> It is capital intensive to buy or build warehouses. Even retailers like Amazon can&#8217;t afford to tie up billions of dollars in getting warehouses up when they need that capital to finance inventory and operations. It&#8217;s the same reason why most big companies don&#8217;t own the big building they house their workers in. Prologis attracts investor capital for exactly this line of business and has become a <a href="https://www.prologis.com/news-research/success-stories/amazon-delivering-complex-class-facility-less-year">specialist</a> in building quality warehouses, including pioneering the concept of <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/smart-capacity/prologis-builds-first-multilevel-dc">multi-story</a> warehouses.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fluid supply chains create tenants.</strong> Even large retailers are often making adjustments to their supply chains which influences where and for how long they might need a warehouse. Renting has its benefits over buying as a result. </p></li></ul><p>What&#8217;s ahead for Prologis? Hamid estimates another 800M square feet of warehouse space is needed to make the supply chain resilient. Demand doesn&#8217;t seem to be a problem. The real question lies in the supply. Is there space to build new warehouses around the dense cities where consumer demand is concentrated? Will warehouses continue to be these mega facilities or will they get miniaturized and scattered across a city? How will regulation impact warehouse supply? The trucks streaming in and out of them cause significant traffic and pollution after all.

Should investing in ecommerce capabilities continue to be a focus? A few thoughts.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Ecommerce growth is harder to achieve for SMBs. </strong>For small online merchants, 2021 was a year defined not by the pandemic, but by privacy changes that dramatically impacted how brands could acquire customers online. Performance marketing channels like Facebook, long the primary growth mechanism for small brands to get in front of their desired audiences due to deep targeting capabilities, became much less efficient. To counter this, brands tried to shift to new strategies like influencer but largely could not achieve the same level of efficiency and scale. My expectation is that smaller brands will continue to struggle for the near future until new distribution opportunities emerge. I think this will happen though and early examples are emerging:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.coopcommerce.com/">Co-op Commerce</a> is enabling brands to drive traffic to one another. </p></li><li><p><a href="https://shop.app/">Shopify</a> may be enabling a new discovery layer itself via Shop app. </p></li><li><p><a href="https://lustre.ai/">Lustre</a> is building a new ecommerce-focused search engine. </p></li><li><p>Roku and Fire TV are reaching scale in connected TV, allowing brands to get in front of consumers on the bigger screen. </p></li><li><p>Roblox and Rec Room may allow brands be to discovered in the metaverse. </p></li><li><p>And if ecommerce growth isn&#8217;t possible to achieve, companies like <a href="https://www.faire.com/">Faire</a> and <a href="https://www.ankorstore.com/">Ankorstore</a> may help small brands shift their businesses offline via their digital marketplaces that connect brands to retailers. </p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Enterprise-scale brands and retailers are all-in on ecommerce. </strong>While SMBs may be struggling to grow their ecommerce businesses, enterprise-scale brands and retailers are not. Large brands tend to have better margins due to economies of scale, have larger marketing budgets especially for driving brand awareness, and can build brand recognition offline which benefits them online. The big focus for these brands and retailers is to now close the loop between their offline and online businesses, which brands like Nike are doing by shuttering wholesale relationships which they don&#8217;t get customer data through. Some proof points on how large brands are growing:</p><ul><li><p>Estee Lauder now sees 40% of its US beauty sales coming from online channels, up 2x from 2019. </p></li><li><p>Nike saw ecommerce sales grow 25% YoY in their fiscal Q1 2022, which now represents 21% of total sales. US ecommerce sales grew 40% YoY.</p></li><li><p>Levi&#8217;s saw ecommerce sales grow 75% YoY in their fiscal Q2 2021, which now represents 23% of total sales. This is up from 10% in 2015. </p></li><li><p>Procter &amp; Gamble saw ecommerce sales grow 35% YoY in their full year fiscal 2021, which now represents 14% of total sales. </p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Certain product categories are still seeing strong ecommerce growth despite the headwind of store re-openings. </strong>While growth is slowing for ecommerce as a whole, certain categories continue to see elevated growth. Those categories specifically are fashion, food, and health and personal care. Fashion is bouncing back as people re-enter the world and want to look their best. Food is benefitting from the increased convenience of delivery, supply chain challenges for grocers, and the increasing fragmentation of taste. Health and personal care spend is similarly shifting online due to wider selection of products, especially around emerging trends like <a href="https://commonthreadco.com/blogs/coachs-corner/beauty-industry-cosmetics-marketing-ecommerce">clean beauty</a> and products that are more personalized for the consumer.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb190cd0-cbc2-47d1-9ad1-001f1c0a0799_470x586.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb190cd0-cbc2-47d1-9ad1-001f1c0a0799_470x586.png" width="470" height="586" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fb190cd0-cbc2-47d1-9ad1-001f1c0a0799_470x586.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:586,&quot;width&quot;:470,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:27347,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb190cd0-cbc2-47d1-9ad1-001f1c0a0799_470x586.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb190cd0-cbc2-47d1-9ad1-001f1c0a0799_470x586.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb190cd0-cbc2-47d1-9ad1-001f1c0a0799_470x586.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb190cd0-cbc2-47d1-9ad1-001f1c0a0799_470x586.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div></li><li><p><strong>Ultimately, the core asset for a merchant is customer data, not stores, websites, or inventory.</strong> In my opinion, it&#8217;s incorrect to think about commerce through the lens of channel or product category. Ultimately, commerce is about understanding who your customer is, learning about what they need at any given time or inspiring them to &#8220;want&#8221; something, and communicating with them to match a product with that need or want as seamlessly and delightfully as possible. Stores are particularly good mechanisms to inspire &#8220;wants&#8221;. Ecommerce is a particularly good mechanism to solve &#8220;needs&#8221;. Both are important. And having unified data that gives you a singular view into who your customer is and how they behave is the most important thing of all. </p></li></ul><div class="captioned-button-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://dailyconsumer.substack.com/p/daily-consumer-22-ecommerce-growth?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Enjoying Daily Consumer?

I&#8217;m personally not a big believer in celebrity-driven brands, especially ones where the brand is named after the celebrity. Celebrities have fairly short &#8220;shelf lives&#8221; of 10-20 years for the most part, so it&#8217;s hard for me to believe that their brands will be any more enduring. Plus, they are running multiple businesses at any given time (in this case, being an athlete), so it&#8217;s hard to believe that the celebrity can channel the energy needed to make a product brand successful.

A few key things occurred:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Consumer demand exploded.</strong> Prior to the pandemic, consumers would often go to stores to buy things and would also spend a lot of their money on services (think a massage, haircut, theme park visit, etc.). Due to the pandemic, consumers stayed in their homes which shifted all of their product spend to ecommerce and also increased their spending on products as a result of not leaving the home to visit service providers.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Labor tightened.</strong> Across the supply chain, labor was harder to procure as a result of the pandemic. Many manufacturers had to shut down due to Covid outbreaks and logistics firms found it hard to find labor to move goods. Also, stimulus checks disincentivized a certain percentage of workers from working low-paying jobs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Logistics assets (trucks, ships, ports) became overwhelmed.</strong> Gridlock started forming as a result of an all-time high amount of goods being imported to meet the growing consumer demand. Ports began to be overwhelmed, as did trucking capacity to take containers from ports, and warehouse space to ingest those items. All of this built on itself to cause longer times to get goods through the chain (ex. with ships idling to unload goods at ports, there are now less ships to transport other goods).</p></li></ul><p>So where do we go from here? A few predictions:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Fighting the backlog will continue.</strong> 2022 will continue to be a year of fighting through the gridlock. Companies like Flexport are finding innovative solutions to increase logistics capacity. However, we may not see much improvement if the Omicron variant drives another wave of shutdowns. </p></li><li><p><strong>Automation will become a focus within warehouses.</strong> Labor is getting more expensive. And we already have technologies that can automate the movement of goods at various layers of the supply chain. For example, <a href="https://www.vecnarobotics.com/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-pallet-truck/?utm_source=Googleads&amp;utm_campaign=(_campaign)&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA5t-OBhByEiwAhR-hm27Rcyj6dPLvUh21NB9gEGH9XFvBOE4MHkrmuyOTt_0kQZmduLhQYxoCl4UQAvD_BwE">Vecna</a> offers autonomous pallet jacks that can move pallets around warehouses with no human involvement and our portfolio company <a href="https://covariant.ai/">Covariant</a> offers autonomous robotic arms that automates the process of picking and packing goods into boxes. Even if labor is cheaper, the reliability of robotics may lead to increased investment in the technology.</p></li><li><p><strong>Domestic manufacturing may resurge.</strong> If you produce goods closer to your demand, you can eliminate a few steps from the supply chain (see the graphic above). The question though is whether the economics of moving manufacturing domestically makes sense given how expensive domestic labor is on a relative basis. The NY Times goes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/05/business/economy/supply-chain-reshoring-us-manufacturing.html">deeper</a> on this.</p></li><li><p><strong>Predictive inventory software will emerge.</strong> Brands today place orders with manufacturers in a relatively manual manner, largely involving Excel sheets and email. Often times, these orders don&#8217;t account for current transport times or demand patterns. I&#8217;m certainly on the lookout for software that can bring an added layer of intelligence to how brands think about what quantity of goods to order at what time. Some early examples are emerging which you can see in the &#8216;Software&#8217; part of the Funding and Exits section below.</p></li></ul><p>This post was inspired by a recently published <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/interview-ryan-petersen-ceo-of-flexport?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo2ODI1MDM0LCJwb3N0X2lkIjo0NTg4Nzc3NiwiXyI6Im5UQWN3IiwiaWF0IjoxNjQxMjcxNzEzLCJleHAiOjE2NDEyNzUzMTMsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0zNTM0NSIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.kvCgvXgbohRFew0lhv9fMKV-V0F07167BalwCuQIQ28">interview</a> with Ryan Petersen, the founder/CEO of Flexport. I think that&#8217;s worth a read as well. Lastly, if you have some hunches or views on the state of the supply chain, I&#8217;d love to hear them.</p><blockquote><h3>Community</h3></blockquote><ul><li><p>Congrats to readers from Nacelle, Co-op Commerce, Fast, Loop, Peel Insights, Fabric, Italic, Bolt, Stord, Klaviyo, Cresicor, and Via for being named by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/retail-tech-startups-hiring-klaviyo-bolt-fabric-2021-12#via-17">Business Insider</a> as a retail tech startup to watch.</p></li><li><p>If you have news that you&#8217;d like to share, I&#8217;d be happy to consider including it in future editions.

Time is passing rapidly, and it feels like the world is evolving quickly. Just in 2021, we witnessed:</p><ul><li><p>The easing of a pandemic coupled with tremendous government-driven stimulus.</p></li><li><p>Significant price increases and supply shortages for seemingly everything.</p></li><li><p>Global climate shocks including long-not-seen snowfall in Texas and Madrid, record fires in Oregon and Greece, and tremendous flooding in China and India. It feels like we wear masks as much due to air quality as we due to sickness prevention.</p></li></ul><p>This is leading me to think about 2022 and what I feel might emerge around how we conduct commerce. 5 quick predictions:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Resale will thrive.</strong> We live in a supply constrained world. Used cars are selling for more than what people paid for them several years ago. Video game consoles are re-selling like luxury items. Until the supply chain clears up, which may not be until 2023, consumers may have no choice but to buy the things they want secondhand and likely for a markup to retail.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sustainability will gain momentum.</strong> The writing seems to be on the wall for businesses that profit at the expense of the environment. What good is &#8220;maximizing shareholder value&#8221; if there is no planet for shareholders to enjoy? We are beginning to see regulators and consumers demand alignment between business and environment. I expect to see sustainability-forward brands enter the zeitgeist and for all businesses to loudly demonstrate how they offset their environment impact. </p></li><li><p><strong>Commerce will become entertaining.</strong> We live in an entertainment-driven world but commerce is anything but entertaining today. Look at just about any brand&#8217;s storefront today and you&#8217;ll see a whole lot of 2D photos, text, and buttons. I expect commerce content to converge with what we stare at for hours each day on Instagram, TikTok, Youtube, and Netflix. In fact, these platforms may become the true gateways to commerce themselves. </p></li><li><p><strong>Virtual goods will be as in demand as physical goods.</strong> A lot of physical goods are status symbols. What good is a status symbol though if no one can see it? As remote education and remote work continues to stick around, a significant portion of consumer demand while shift from physical goods to virtual. Consumers will buy the status symbols that can be seen, items like virtual clothing for avatars in games.</p></li><li><p><strong>The supply chain will begin to be automated.</strong> The supply chain shock that we witnessed in 2021 has made the investment case for warehouse robotics and other forms of automation much clearer for businesses. Having toured many warehouses and fulfillment centers, I am personally eager for this to happen. Walking 12 miles per day in a warehouse to pick items off of shelves and put them in boxes is not a type of work that I think we as a society should be putting any people behind. Nor is it the most reliable way to facilitate commerce, which we are witnessing this year. </p></li></ul><blockquote><h3>Community</h3></blockquote><ul><li><p>A few founders are looking to better understand advertising on the connected TV platforms.

Consumers now spend more on food from restaurants than grocery stores (<a href="https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/financing/consumers-are-back-spending-more-restaurants-grocers">source</a>), a trend that we expect to continue. In addition, consumers are increasingly accessing food from restaurants via delivery and pickup apps, which we at Index see as the beginning of the restaurant industry&#8217;s &#8220;ecommerce moment.&#8221;</p><p>While the frontend of the restaurant is benefiting from technology, the backend has not received the same attention. Restaurant operators still rely on manual workflows to run their business, with the biggest cost center being inventory purchasing (the COGS line item on a P&amp;L).</p><p>Pepper is a platform that digitizes how restaurants interface with their inventory suppliers, like providers of ingredients, utensils, and packaging. Instead of having to call a distributor or wait for a rep to walk in the door with a clipboard, Pepper now <a href="https://medium.com/usepepper/the-thyme-is-now-tech-and-the-food-supply-chain-10f9ffcbe7e4">enables restaurants</a> to discover, purchase, and reorder inventory via their smartphone or computer.</p><p>Pepper has built a software and payments platform that is adopted by suppliers directly. Suppliers onboard onto the platform and enable a Shopify-like storefront. They then share access to this storefront with their restaurant customers who can discover items to purchase and pay digitally.</p><p>The value is significant to all users of the platform. Suppliers are able to spend less time and money to win and grow business from restaurants. Restaurants save time by ordering and paying for inventory digitally and have more insight into how much their inventory will cost.</p><p>Bowie, Chetan, Ivana and the rest of the Pepper team live and breathe restaurants and are the type of people we want to be in business with. Bowie and Chetan were members of the founding team at Uber Eats within the broader Uber organization and played large roles in scaling the service. The team is transparent, humble, hardworking, and fosters tremendous loyalty from their peers and direct reports, which we heard over and over again when checking references. Demand for Pepper has also never been more evident with dozens of suppliers now onboarded onto the platform and thousands of end restaurants actively ordering through it.</p><p>We feel it's a matter of time before Pepper becomes ubiquitous amongst food suppliers and restaurants. We&#8217;re excited to demonstrate this conviction by announcing the company's $16M Series A financing. Index led the investment round with participation from our friends at Greylock, Imaginary Ventures, BoxGroup, and Moving Capital.

It&#8217;s a gamechanger when it comes to working out at home. The killer feature is that you never need to think about how much weight to lift for a particular movement. The machine figures out your optimal weight at any given time and tracks everything. Highly recommend the investment, which has me convinced I&#8217;ll never go to a gym again.

I wanted to take a shot at visualizing why I think PayPal is motivated to do this. The short of it is the notion of &#8220;integrated commerce&#8221;, which I define as an ecommerce transaction occurring in one place end-to-end. This hypothetical commerce experience would encompass everything from discovery, or how a consumer finds something they want to buy, to payment. </p><p>In China, this type of integrated commerce experience already exists. TikTok has enabled it, as has Alibaba. To get a sense, check out this <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-21/china-s-lipstick-brother-livestream-has-record-2-billion-day">milestone</a> that occurred on Taobao, Alibaba&#8217;s social commerce platform, a few days ago. </p><p>In the US, however, ecommerce is very disjointed. You learn about a product on Facebook, link out to a Shopify store, and pay through a credit card which is processed by Stripe. </p><p>This flow will likely change though as TikTok invests aggressively to replicate its integrated commerce experience in the US and potentially as advertising revenue is disrupted by privacy changes. Facebook, Snap, and others are clearly sprinting to keep up.</p><p>PayPal&#8217;s exploration of Pinterest likely signals concern that they could get cut out of the equation. If Facebook or TikTok owns discovery, and soon the store and checkout, then they could likely block PayPal out of the payment flow. Shopify already proved that being higher up the stack allows you to own the merchant payments opportunity.

A profile of the man behind it. &#8220;In the mid-2000s, Amazon developed an internal &#8216;Google reliance&#8217; metric, which focused on how much Amazon itself was paying Google to bring shoppers to the retailer&#8217;s site through search ads. If that metric remained high, executives worried, Amazon could be in jeopardy if Google itself ever decided to make a more serious foray into online commerce. Amazon&#8217;s solution was to convince shoppers to start their product searches on Amazon rather than on Google, by investing in the retailer&#8217;s own search experience, people familiar with the matter said.&#8221;</p></li><li><p><a href="https://mobiledevmemo.com/diseconomies-scale-mobile-advertising/?utm_source=Master+the+Meta&amp;utm_campaign=bd9840c5a5-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_11_29_05_22_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_ce5fd70254-bd9840c5a5-384986604">Explainer</a> on diseconomies of scale in mobile advertising.

I wanted to shine some light on what this India-based ecommerce marketplace is doing that is leading to fast growth and interest from the likes of Facebook to invest. I figured the best way to profile the business was to ask for perspectives from someone who is directly involved. The below comes from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/balachandrasekaran">Bala Chandrasekaran</a> who helped champion his firm&#8217;s decision to invest. </p><p><strong>Q: What is the simplest way you can describe what Meesho is doing?</strong></p><p>A: Meesho is an Indian social commerce company that gained popularity as a platform enabling small businesses and individuals to start online stores via social platforms (WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram). Since its founding, Meesho has evolved into the go-to e-commerce destination for T3/T4 cities, where they specialize in unbranded/unorganized products. Over 70% of their sales are coming from now end-customers buying directly on the app.</p><p><strong>Q: Who are Meesho sellers / why are there so many people that are a good fit to sell on Meesho?</strong></p><p>A: Meesho has three sides to its marketplace: suppliers (manufacturers and distributors), resellers, and customers.</p><p>Resellers and suppliers are both considered sellers on the platform. When Meesho originally launched, resellers would coordinate with customers via WhatsApp on products they were interested in buying, and then resellers would buy from the suppliers. As Meesho gained popularity in India, suppliers and customers started interacting directly. So you could say Meesho sellers are both resellers and suppliers.</p><p>To answer the latter part of your question on why there are so many people that are a good fit - I would say that some of the most successful companies in the last decade and a half have been companies that have enabled people to have their own agency in the businesses they choose to take part in. I'm talking about companies like Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, Shopify, etc. The core value that all these companies have in common is that they enable everyday people to become businesspeople. It's a cliche, but "talent is universal but opportunity is not" rings true for all of these businesses.</p><p>I think Meesho is doing very much the same. They are extremely seller-friendly and make it so sellers have no upfront capital requirements to launch their business, including equipping sellers with the necessary toolkit (i.e payments, logistics, marketing, etc).</p><p><strong>Q: Isn't Meesho just enabling what we would call "multi-level marketing/selling" in the US?</strong></p><p>A: This is a reductive way to think about Meesho and an example of how US and Indian markets aren't directly comparable. As of last year, Meesho stopped charging commissions on products sold through the Meesho platform. This is part of what made them extremely supplier friendly and why so many suppliers exclusively offer their products on Meesho. Multi-level marketing in the US relies on pyramid-scheme dynamics to sustain less-efficient alternatives to highly organized, high-trust retail options. Meesho helps bring the offline, unorganized retail market online, creating a better option for Indian consumers while addressing the low-trust issue that is so prevalent in the Indian market. They also alleviate access issues by enabling selling over channels like WhatsApp/mobile that are more readily accessible in Tier 2+ cities. This is a huge unlock for Indian consumers in Tier 2+ cities, where they rely heavily on unorganized retail. Goes without saying I think Meesho is building something very special and impactful for India.</p><p><strong>Q: Why is this form of commerce growing so quickly in India? It seems very different from how products are discovered and purchased&nbsp;in the US.</strong></p><p>A: I think one of the areas we really had to call out during the diligence process was how difficult it was to build empathy for the Indian market as a US resident.</p><p>Important context on the Indian market is that they operate in a trust-deficit, meaning that the average consumer has little trust in anyone outside themselves, their friends, and their community.</p><p>When Meesho started, their wedge into the social commerce space was empowering resellers who historically couldn't build their businesses due to the upfront capital requirements. With Meesho, resellers could start businesses instantaneously and have the necessary toolbox (i.e. payments, logistics, marketing, etc) to build successful businesses while employing an asset-light inventory model by relying on Meesho's thoroughly curated supplier network. This enabled people within narrower trust networks to sell to each other.</p><p>Meesho's unique selling point was empowering individuals to leverage this community-trust dynamic and use it as a distribution for their social shops. This initial wedge created virality for Meesho, powering them to the top of India's app store. The local community-trust dynamic is an idiosyncrasy of the Indian market that wasn't easy to grok at first since it was so conceptually different from what we are used to seeing in the US. It's a powerful lever that Meesho has leaned on to grow.</p><p><strong>Q: It's interesting to see Facebook invest in a startup. How do Facebook and other social networks play a role in Meesho's business?</strong></p><p>A: The main bet that I think everyone believes in is that social commerce is going to grow significantly and capture mindshare on a global scale. It's no surprise that Facebook/Instagram are tackling the social commerce space pretty aggressively. I think in the US market they have good positioning given how much time FB/IG users spend on the apps.</p><p>However, in the Indian market, I think the dynamic is quite different. Consumers spend most of their time on WhatsApp and, as I mentioned before, India is considered a trust-deficit market, so the same tactics that work in the US won't necessarily work in India.</p><p>With this in mind, Facebook can try to tackle the social commerce market through IG the same way they approached the US market or they can invest in players in the local market that have significant edges. I think that was the case with Facebook investing in Meesho.</p><p>One of the extremely compelling aspects of the investment in Meesho was its logistics network. Meesho accounts for very large logistics volume in India, giving them pricing power with logistics providers because they can offer uniquely high utilization. These savings get passed down to suppliers, which makes Meesho the most supplier-friendly place to sell. At this point, Meesho has established itself as the best place for suppliers to showcase their unorganized retail products, with a majority of those products exclusive to Meesho's platforms. These sorts of moats are difficult for competitors to crack, especially for non-local businesses like Facebook who don't have their pulse on the market the way Meesho does.</p><p>My read on Facebook's participation was that since it'll be hard to compete head-to-head it makes sense to double-down on Meesho because most of their business is fueled through WhatsApp, which Facebook owns anyways.</p><p><strong>Q: Is there some metric you can share that particularly 'wow's you about Meesho?</strong></p><p>A: Can't share any specific metrics about Meesho, however, I think the most mind-boggling statistic is the one they led within the fundraising <a href="https://twitter.com/viditaatrey/status/1443428830450884611">announcement</a>:</p><p><em>"Today, 5% of Indian households shop with us EVERY Day, with 75% of them from Tier 2+ cities."</em></p><p>When I read that, it took me a second to internalize the magnitude of how important Meesho was to the Indian population. 5% of all Indian households, <em>every day</em>, is an enormous number of people.</p><p>The other interesting market statistic that surprised us during diligence was how nascent the Indian market was in getting people online and into ecommerce. Unlike the US market, Indian consumers primarily shop in unorganized retail. In 2021, the unorganized retail TAM is $792B and is expected to grow to $994B by 2025. In 2025, India's unorganized retail will contribute ~76% of overall retail in India. This dynamic is very similar to that of China where unorganized retail is ~80% of overall retail. Pinduoduo (PDD) was the primary beneficiary of unorganized retail moving online in China.</p><p>There's a nice analog between companies like PDD and Meesho. In China, PDD is leveraging their 1B+ MAUs on WeChat to drive sales. Similarly, India is positioned well to do the same by enabling its ~500M+ WhatsApp users to access commerce. The tailwinds of WhatsApp and Jio dropping data prices are unlocking a huge swath of internet users. India will exceed 800M Internet users by 2022 and Meesho is enabling these users to effortlessly integrate into the ecommerce ecosystem from the palm of their hands.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ccbed15-e490-4a6a-91d5-47a069d817c2_1280x800.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ccbed15-e490-4a6a-91d5-47a069d817c2_1280x800.png" width="1280" height="800" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9ccbed15-e490-4a6a-91d5-47a069d817c2_1280x800.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:800,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:745758,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ccbed15-e490-4a6a-91d5-47a069d817c2_1280x800.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ccbed15-e490-4a6a-91d5-47a069d817c2_1280x800.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ccbed15-e490-4a6a-91d5-47a069d817c2_1280x800.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ccbed15-e490-4a6a-91d5-47a069d817c2_1280x800.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">A Meesho advertisement banner.</figcaption></figure></div><blockquote><h3>Community</h3></blockquote><ul><li><p><a href="https://quantmar.com/">QuantMar</a> is a great forum-based community for performance marketers. </p></li><li><p><a href="https://commerceplus.shopify.com/?utm_source=retailbrew&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=2021-09-commerceplus&amp;utm_content=newsletter_registernow_week3">Shopify</a> is hosting Commerce+, a virtual roundtable with notable brand founders.</p></li></ul><blockquote><h3>News</h3></blockquote><ul><li><p><strong>Advertising.</strong> </p><ul><li><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/pinterest-rolls-out-new-shopping-features-for-advertisers/">Pinterest</a> launches new ecommerce ad formats including collection slideshows and is also expanding its Verified Merchant Program.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/snapchat-revamps-creator-payouts-by-offering-chance-to-win-prizes-with-spotlight-challenges/">Snapchat</a> revamps their creator programs.

Thank you Amazon in particular.</p><p>However, businesses didn&#8217;t necessarily see the same value in shifting the purchasing of their inventory online. Digital buying required re-training of employees and suppliers didn&#8217;t necessarily have their inventory accessible online or any reason to make it accessible.</p><p>Why is B2B commerce unlocking now? I see a few core drivers:</p><ol><li><p><strong>A younger workforce.</strong> Older workers are retiring and younger workers are taking their place. Younger employees are digital natives and untrained at doing things in the &#8220;old way&#8221; like sending a fax, answering phones, logging data on paper. Business owners will need to adapt to how their employees are accustomed to working, which is with smartphones and computers. </p></li><li><p><strong>The pandemic is reshaping supply chain.</strong> Restaurants used to primarily order their food inventory by having a sales rep come by their store every week and take down their order on a clipboard. The pandemic made it difficult to send field sales reps to stores - labor became tight and many restaurants temporarily and unpredictably closed their doors. Labor challenges upstream also caused sudden shortages of food inventory. Distributors responded by connecting their ERPs to ecommerce storefronts and allowing restaurants to see and buy their inventory digitally - something that finally offered tremendous value to both sides. </p></li><li><p><strong>Business operations are being digitized.</strong> Over the last decade in particular, we have seen the digitization of just about all industries. Construction sites are using 3D mapping tools, digital blueprint software, and digital task management tools to streamline their builds. Healthcare clinicians are logging patient data directly into EHR software while managing a visit. The workflows of just about all industries have been mapped to software and are encompassing the purchasing needs of the businesses as well. The next step is for suppliers to do their part to get inventory flowing digitally and more programmatically. </p></li><li><p><strong>B2B checkout now exists.</strong> B2C commerce required online sellers to simply accept credit/debit cards, which most buyers already had. B2B commerce is much more complicated. Sometimes payment happens upfront with check or credit card, sometimes it happens on purchase order, sometimes it happens with third-party financing. Often times the buyer (the person choosing what inventory to buy) is different from the funder (the person who reviews the purchase, approves it, and figures out how to pay). However, the infrastructure now exists for B2B payments to flow seamlessly. In the last 5 years, amazing tools have emerged for bank account authentication, credit risk scoring, transaction logging into ERPs, and other payment-related workflows which will finally allow B2B checkout to exist.</p></li></ol><p>I&#8217;m picking through different industries now to see which are ripest to move their buying online. Just this year, I have made two un-announced investments in the construction space and restaurant space around this theme. I hope to find many more and would be happy to discuss with those interested in the topic. </p><blockquote><h3>Community</h3></blockquote><ul><li><p><strong>A big thank you</strong> to Lindsay Walker, SVP Customer Success at Checkout.com, for making some creative agency intros for the Curtsy team!</p></li><li><p><a href="https://commercenext.com/irl2021/">CommerceNext</a> is next week on Sep 28-29th. </p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2021/09/16/tj-mahonys-new-40m-fund-to-focus-on-how-people.html">TJ Mahony</a> launches Vinyl, a new venture capital firm focused on &#8220;how people buy stuff&#8221;.

I can&#8217;t confirm the acquisition price but can say I&#8217;m not surprised by the size. Daniel Rotman, the founder and CEO of Pretty Litter, is an amazing entrepreneur and someone I&#8217;ve gotten to know over the past few years. The founding story of the company ties into a personal experience of Daniel&#8217;s when his cat suddenly passed away. He wished there was a way to better understand the health of cats and embarked on building Pretty Litter.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, some background on both businesses:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Pretty Litter.</strong> Is a brand of cat litter. What&#8217;s unique about the product is that the crystal-based litter houses diagnostic capabilities and will change color based on the health of your cat. This is a big unlock as cats are quite non-expressive and can hide their sickness. With the product being crystal-based, it is very lightweight to ship. Lastly, the product is subscription-based which adds additional convenience for customers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mars.</strong> Is a conglomerate that is split between its petcare business and its confectionary/food business (think M&amp;Ms). The petcare business accounts for the largest share of revenue and encapsulates:</p><ul><li><p><em>Vetcare clinics</em> - Mars owns VCA and Banfield, which are the largest vet clinic franchises in the US. Both are also growing quickly via the acquisition of other vet clinics.</p></li><li><p><em>Pet food</em> - Mars owns several dog and cat food brands like IAMs, Whiskas, and Pedigree. </p></li></ul></li></ul><p>So why is Mars acquiring this brand?</p><ul><li><p><strong>Pet ownership is booming.</strong> The pandemic drove up pet adoption rates significantly, and pets are becoming increasingly ingrained in family life. This is driving up willingness to spend on their wellbeing. More specific to Pretty Litter, cat ownership in the US is growing extremely quickly and is more common than dog ownership. 30% of US households, 36M in total, have cats!</p></li><li><p><strong>Exposure to a premium consumer.</strong> Pretty Litter is a premium litter product that retails at a higher price point than most other brands. What does Mars get with Pretty Litter? A customer base of cat owners, slightly concentrated in urban markets, who are likely to be great vet clinic customers and cat food buyers. Let the cross-selling begin. </p></li><li><p><strong>A great business.</strong> Pretty Litter is a pioneer of subscription commerce online. Their product category is well suited to it - cats need cat litter to go to the bathroom and going to the bathroom is habitual. They have also shaped their product&#8217;s form factor in a way that makes it pleasant to stay on subscription. It&#8217;s easy to estimate how much product you need per shipment, and it easily arrives at your doorstep unlike most litter. The high lifetime value of customers, enabled by the subscription model, and the innovation around the core product unlocked scalable marketing channels for Pretty Litter. Performance channels like Facebook, where Pretty Litter could target pet owners, scaled very well. This business model equation resulted in a company that didn&#8217;t need much external capital to grow to extremely impressive revenue scale. I can&#8217;t share the revenue trajectory, but it&#8217;s impressive, especially given the company raised &lt;$2M of external capital in its lifetime. </p></li></ul><p>All in all, this is a startup story worth recognizing and celebrating. Daniel and the Pretty Litter team built an innovative, mission-driven brand that solved a real pain point for cat owners and did it without relying on venture capital to scale. Big kudos and excited to see Pretty Litter grow from here with the support of Mars!</p><blockquote><h3>Community</h3></blockquote><ul><li><p>Anonymous - A DTC brand is looking for recommendations on good creative agencies to consider to set creative direction and produce video ads for digital channels.</p></li></ul><blockquote><h3>News</h3></blockquote><ul><li><p><strong>Affiliate Marketing.</strong> </p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-times-wirecutter-product-review-site-moves-behind-paywall-11630436401">Wirecutter</a>, the popular online publication that reviews and recommends products and is owned by The New York Times, is moving behind a subscription paywall.

Muse has built a website builder, in some ways similar to Squarespace, but specific to 3D websites. This has only recently become possible as modern web browsers have adopted WebGL, a framework that enables interactive 2D and 3D graphics without the use of plug-ins.</p><p>Since releasing their product a few weeks ago, Muse has seen several small ecommerce brands experiment with building their online stores in 3D.

Having a differentiated store experience is central to building a strong and differentiated brand online. Muse supercharges this by allowing brands to create a 3D space to present themselves and their products, complete with background audio and other store &#8220;props&#8221;. </p><p>Muse has some other fascinating capabilities. For example, their platform allows browser users to explore a 3D website together. Theoretically, an online store could staff up their website with a sales associate to guide a prospective customer through their discovery process. </p><p>Muse is a very early stage startup. They will be releasing more ecommerce capabilities over the coming months. It&#8217;s also very early days for the trend of 3D websites that they are enabling but is undoubtedly something to watch.</p><blockquote><h3>Community</h3></blockquote><ul><li><p>No requests this week.</p></li></ul><blockquote><h3>News</h3></blockquote><ul><li><p><strong>Advertising.</strong> </p><ul><li><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/twitter-super-follows-monetization/">Twitter</a> rollouts out &#8216;Super Follows&#8217; which allows users to pay for access to other user&#8217;s private tweets. </p></li><li><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/chrome-beta-to-experiment-with-a-more-powerful-new-tab-page-web-highlights-and-search-changes/">Google</a> is rolling out some major changes in the Chrome browser Beta program.
