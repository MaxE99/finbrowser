Every other week I take a closer look at what drives a SaaS company&#8217;s growth. Expect deep dive takes on SaaS pricing, product-led growth, public company benchmarks, and much more.</em></p><p>I don&#8217;t know who needs to hear this, but your feature gating has probably gone too far. </p><p>Ask yourself: is your entry-level plan good enough for the customers you want to attract? There&#8217;s a very real possibility that you&#8217;re not giving *enough* away for free.</p><p>It&#8217;s time to stop gating the features that make your customers successful. Doing so artificially constrains your ability to embrace both <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/product-led-growth/">product-led growth</a> (PLG) and <a href="https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/usage-based-pricing-20?s=w">usage-based pricing</a> (UBP). If nobody can get value out of your entry-level product, why offer it in the first place?</p><p>Let&#8217;s dive in before I get cancelled &#129315;. </p><h1>How we got here</h1><p>As a recovering pricing consultant, I understand the logic behind charging more for your most premium, ROI-generating features. It helps you fund additional product development and pour more money into your sales and marketing efforts. It covers costs associated with distributing, supporting, and maintaining your product. And it&#8217;s (usually) a surefire route to faster revenue growth in the near-term.</p><p>You&#8217;ve probably seen this play out in your own startup. Let&#8217;s imagine you built a generous PLG product, which is loved by users and spreads like wildfire through word-of-mouth. But at some point you start to feel an intense external pressure to grow revenue even faster. Or perhaps your sellers keep telling you that they can&#8217;t hit quota because they&#8217;re losing Enterprise deals to the free product. </p><p>And so you do what anyone would do: you gate features. </p><p>It might be innocuous enough at first; after all, there&#8217;s still so much goodness for users to experience. But each feature gate brings the fresh dopamine of incremental revenue, leading to more and more gates each quarter. And with no VP of Free to push back (<a href="https://www.saastr.com/blog-the-customer-that-needs-a-champion-your-free-customers/">which probably *should* be a thing</a>), you might just kill the very foundation of your long-term growth. </p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://kylepoyar.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Kyle Poyar&#8217;s Growth Unhinged!

And then to make it as frictionless as possible for the customer to grow with you. </p><p>Ungating access to your product doesn&#8217;t mean that you aren&#8217;t monetizing it. It means you put your best foot forward when customers are giving your product a try, then charge on the basis of product usage rather than feature access.</p><blockquote><p><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kyle-poyar_miro-plg-teardown-activity-6884864702724276225-rVzo?utm_source=linkedin_share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web">Miro</a> - the visual collaboration platform - has a free edition that includes unlimited users as well as core integrations with tools like Zoom, Slack, Trello, Zapier, and Google Drive. Miro&#8217;s paywall is primarily based on usage (3 editable boards), creating a compelling monetization path.</em></p></blockquote><p>I&#8217;m also not advising you to give your entire product away for free; you still need to give folks a reason to pay for your product. </p><p>But make sure to gate &#8216;superpowers&#8217; that make customers <em>even more successful</em> or are only valid for select high value use cases, not core functionality that everyone needs. Discovering what these &#8216;superpowers&#8217; are requires research, testing and iteration. More on that later. </p><p>Let&#8217;s walk through a few common pitfalls of feature gating.</p><h3>Free offerings</h3><p>Many Free offerings are so restrictive that your target customer dismisses it entirely. You lose the advantage of leveraging your product as a marketing channel, which is the key benefit of a free product.<br><br>What you're left with are hobbyists, non-serious users, and mom-and-pops who don't intend to pay for your service - but who still require support, hosting, and other costs to serve.<br><br>Many companies are coming to this same realization. Take a look at Okta, Mixpanel, and Chargebee, all of which have bucked the trend and made their free products far more generous than before.</p><ul><li><p><em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/okta-launches-a-new-free-developer-plan/">Okta increased the limits of their free developer plan</a></em> by 15x, to 15k MAUs, along with offering better docs, new SDKs, and sample apps. Their goal appears to be courting developers who want to *really* try out the service before they buy.</p></li><li><p><em><a href="https://mixpanel.com/blog/we-increased-the-data-limits-of-our-free-plan-by-100x/">Mixpanel increased the data limits of their free plan by 100x</a></em>. Their goal is to give early stage startups more runway before asking them to pay for Mixpanel&#8217;s product analytics.</p></li><li><p><em><a href="https://www.chargebee.com/blog/launch-plan-2021/">Chargebee doubled their free Launch plan to $100k in revenue for free</a></em>. They're making it easier for startups to build on the platform, then monetize when the company can afford it.</p></li></ul><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/verge/status/1361701610313908225&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;LastPass&#8217; free tier will become a lot less useful next month <a class=\&quot;tweet-url\&quot; href=\&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285531/lastpass-free-tier-mobile-computer-device-premium-family?utm_campaign=theverge&amp;utm_content=chorus&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter\&quot;>theverge.com/2021/2/16/2228&#8230;</a> &quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;verge&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;The Verge&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Tue Feb 16 15:38:57 +0000 2021&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[{&quot;img_url&quot;:&quot;https://pbs.substack.com/media/EuW8ZhtXEAA21u3.jpg&quot;,&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;https://t.co/WfgESQaVzj&quot;,&quot;alt_text&quot;:null}],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:130,&quot;like_count&quot;:502,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null}"><a href="https://twitter.com/verge/status/1361701610313908225" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-user-avatar" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/twitter_name/w_36/verge.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @verge"><span class="tweet-author-name">The Verge </span><span class="tweet-author">@verge</span></div>LastPass&#8217; free tier will become a lot less useful next month <a class="tweet-url" href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285531/lastpass-free-tier-mobile-computer-device-premium-family?utm_campaign=theverge&amp;utm_content=chorus&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank">theverge.com/2021/2/16/2228&#8230;</a> <div class="tweet-photos-container"><div class="tweet-photo-wrapper "><img class="tweet-photo" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.substack.com%2Fmedia%2FEuW8ZhtXEAA21u3.jpg" alt="Image"></div></div></a><a href="https://twitter.com/verge/status/1361701610313908225" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-footer"><p class="tweet-date">February 16th 2021</p><span class="retweets"><span class="rt-count">130</span> Retweets</span><span class="likes"><span class="like-count">502</span> Likes</span></div></a></div><h3>SSO</h3><p>We used to think of SSO as an enterprise-specific feature for customers with advanced compliance or security needs. </p><p>But SSO is no longer enough to justify a 2x or 3x jump into the Enterprise offering. Too many companies are missing out by not making SSO more accessible.</p><ul><li><p><em>Having customers adopt SSO is a good thing!</em> It makes it easier for users to log in, no need to remember another password, and it streamlines the ability to add more users. Customers who've implemented SSO tend to be stickier with better retention rates.</p></li><li><p><em>SSO is a "check the box" requirement for many orgs.</em> If you don't offer it, you may not even get included in a customer's evaluation.</p></li><li><p><em>Even small, growing businesses are adopting SSO</em> as part of a Zero Trust security architecture. And modern identity providers like <a href="https://jumpcloud.com/">JumpCloud</a> make implementing SSO both affordable and simple, increasing its adoption.</p></li><li><p><em>The value of SSO doesn't justify price scaling exponentially</em>, which is what happens when it's charged by the user and at 2x or 3x of the per-user price. Your user or buyer doesn't have a massive budget windfall just because their IT or Security team gives them certain requirements. Why should they be punished?</p></li></ul><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/boblord/status/1216466334260707328&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Here is your periodic reminder that companies that charge luxury prices for security features like SSO help keep smaller companies and orgs below the security poverty line. \n\n&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;boblord&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Bob Lord&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Sun Jan 12 21:05:49 +0000 2020&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:40,&quot;like_count&quot;:77,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://sso.tax/&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The SSO Wall of Shame&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;A list of vendors that treat single sign-on as a luxury feature, not a core security requirement.&quot;,&quot;domain&quot;:&quot;sso.tax&quot;},&quot;video_url&quot;:null}"><a href="https://twitter.com/boblord/status/1216466334260707328" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-user-avatar" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/twitter_name/w_36/boblord.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @boblord"><span class="tweet-author-name">Bob Lord </span><span class="tweet-author">@boblord</span></div>Here is your periodic reminder that companies that charge luxury prices for security features like SSO help keep smaller companies and orgs below the security poverty line.

This often happens organically as your customers discover new use cases or bring in other teams.</p><p>It&#8217;s in your best interest to drive as much product engagement and collaboration as possible since it&#8217;ll ultimately benefit you in the long-run. Don&#8217;t put artificial gates up that will hold a customer back.</p><p>Integrations with tools like Slack or Salesforce are classic examples. These features create long-term value in the form of greater expansion revenue and reduced churn, and are items you want the majority of your customers to use. Slack integrations in particular help your users promote the product to other users in their organization.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/why-you-should-give-away-your-features?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/why-you-should-give-away-your-features?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><h1>How Algolia ditched feature gates to launch their most customer friendly pricing ever</h1><p>Algolia, the site search and discovery company founded in 2012 and <a href="https://openview.vc/3ul12e2">now valued at $2.25 billion</a>, came to this conclusion through a course correction. </p><p>I had a chance to sit down with Julien Lemoine (CTO &amp; Co-Founder) and Ga&#235;ten Gachet (Chief Strategy Officer) to learn more about Algolia&#8217;s pricing evolution from the early days until today. Fun fact: this is actually version 8 of Algolia&#8217;s pricing model. </p><blockquote><p><em><strong><a href="https://openview.vc/3ul12e2">You can read the full Algolia story here</a> - I highly recommend it.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>Algolia had a product-led strategy from the beginning, initially targeting developers who became champions for deploying Algolia at companies large and small. </p><p>Starting in 2017, the company had adopted an extreme feature gating approach whereby their most innovative features were reserved only for enterprise plans. This helped sellers close larger and larger deals, but had the inverse effect on Algolia&#8217;s future prospects. PLG leads and community goodwill suffered since developers couldn&#8217;t get their hands on what made Algolia special. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24decf06-86f5-4dfe-aadb-f12137759d09_1148x897.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24decf06-86f5-4dfe-aadb-f12137759d09_1148x897.png" width="481" height="375.83362369337976" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/24decf06-86f5-4dfe-aadb-f12137759d09_1148x897.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:897,&quot;width&quot;:1148,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:481,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24decf06-86f5-4dfe-aadb-f12137759d09_1148x897.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24decf06-86f5-4dfe-aadb-f12137759d09_1148x897.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24decf06-86f5-4dfe-aadb-f12137759d09_1148x897.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24decf06-86f5-4dfe-aadb-f12137759d09_1148x897.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Algolia&#8217;s old pricing (with feature gating)</figcaption></figure></div><p>And so in 2020 the company made a big bet on what it calls its most customer-friendly pricing model ever.

But there&#8217;s no substitute for talking to your users through both 1:1 interviews and online surveys. </p><p>One approach is to break your product down into a list of capabilities that could plausibly be gated. This list can include roadmap items as well as existing features and service offerings such as SLAs or priority support. Ask users to tell you whether each capability is a <em>must have</em>, <em>nice to have</em>, or something they <em>don&#8217;t need</em>. Each package should include all of the <em>must haves </em>and key <em>nice to haves</em>. Things that most users say they <em>don&#8217;t need</em> yet some sophisticated folks find to be extremely valuable are great candidates for higher tier editions. </p><p>While the best companies let user value perception be the primary guide for their decision making, you should also consider other qualitative factors. For instance, does the feature need to be demonstrated or implemented by an expert before someone might see value? Alternatively, is there a tangible cost to deliver the feature, which may make it unsustainable to offer to everyone? Or does the feature help with either data collection or product virality, which supports indirect monetization?</p><p>When in doubt, err on the side of ungating access to your product if you plan to pursue a PLG or UBP strategy. It&#8217;ll help you drive more adoption and become ubiquitous with customers, and you can rest easy knowing that this goodwill will generate higher CLTV in time. </p><p>The success of your customers is the foundation for your own success.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Your guide to sales-assist]]></title><description><![CDATA[Why the new hot PLG job is in sales *gasp*]]></description><link>https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/your-guide-to-sales-assist</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/your-guide-to-sales-assist</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Kyle Poyar]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2022 12:25:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41ea779a-efab-40b3-aba7-2499d0d9ee82_1192x418.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#128075;&nbsp;<em>Hi, I&#8217;m&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-poyar/">Kyle</a> from <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/">OpenView</a>&nbsp;and welcome to my newsletter,&nbsp;<a href="https://kylepoyar.substack.com/">Growth Unhinged</a>. Every other week I take a closer look at what drives a SaaS company&#8217;s growth. Expect deep dive takes on SaaS pricing, product-led growth, public company benchmarks, and much more.</em></p><p>As recently as 2016, Slack Co-Founder &amp; CEO Stewart Butterfield emphasized that Slack intended to keep relying on organic and viral growth rather than a large sales force. Back then he told <em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/slack-ceo-stewart-butterfield-no-salespeople-2016-3">Business Insider</a></em>, &#8220;I think we can get away without having a sales team in any kind of traditional way probably forever.&#8221;</p><p>The best PLG businesses <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/what-is-product-led-growth/">solve end user pain</a>, distribute where those users live, <a href="https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/your-guide-to-self-serve-onboarding?s=w">make it easy to get started</a>, deliver value before the paywall and then hire sales last. </p><p>But they do hire sales! </p><p>In Slack&#8217;s Q2 FY2020 earnings call, Butterfield described the company&#8217;s current go-to-market approach as always starting with the end user, which allows Slack to go &#8216;bottoms-up&#8217; and ultimately win million dollar Enterprise deals. Here&#8217;s what he <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4289748-slack-technologies-inc-work-ceo-daniel-butterfield-on-q2-2020-results-earnings-call?part=single">said</a> on the call:</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;In every case, our sales team had the advantage of a lot of very happy end users. Our history of strong bottoms-up adoption is a vital factor in our success. We only win if people choose Slack, and they choose Slack if it provides real value to them. There is no other path.&#8221; - Stewart Butterfield</em></p></blockquote><p>It even turns out that one element of user pain is not having someone to help them fill out security questionnaires, navigate purchasing processes and work through legal requirements for things like GDPR. Contract size used to dictate when procurement got involved. Now even free tools may go through the same level of scrutiny if important data is involved. Sales can actually enhance the user&#8217;s experience by helping guide them through the buying process rather than forcing them to go it alone.</p><h2>The hottest role in PLG: &#8216;Sales-assist&#8217; </h2><p>There are very real risks in bringing sales into a self-service business. </p><p>An overly aggressive sales team could turn off prospects who just want to use the product and be left alone, cannibalizing self-service conversion. Sales could push the product roadmap towards larger customers with deeper pockets, which could lead to a more complicated and harder to use product. And, let&#8217;s be honest, sales is expensive and can drive CAC up significantly. In many companies, it can start to feel like you&#8217;re building two different companies at the same time.</p><p>So what <em>should</em> sales look like? </p><p>Enter the hottest PLG sales role: sales-assist. These sellers - also called Onboarding Specialists (Airtable), Success Coaches (HubSpot), User Operations (Asana) and Enterprise Advocates (Atlassian) - partner with <a href="https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/your-guide-to-pqls?utm_source=url">Product Qualified Leads (PQLs)</a> to improve their product experience and navigate the buying process. </p><p>Sales-assist reps may work with users pre-conversion <em>or </em>post-conversion. What matters is whether they can uncover friction in the user&#8217;s buying process, remove that friction, and guide users to be more successful. </p><blockquote><p><em>OpenView is actively working on our 2022 <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/2021-product-benchmarks/">Product Benchmarks report</a> to help PLG operators compare themselves against their peers across the metrics that matter most. Please consider taking our <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Z2SBKQW">10-15 minute survey</a>!</em></p></blockquote><h2>Sales-assist at Zapier</h2><p><a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>, the popular automation startup <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/03/08/zapier-bootstraps-to-5-billion-valuation/?sh=4ab9623f1c8e">valued at $5 billion</a>, had raised only $1.3 million in funding to scale to a mind-boggling $140 million revenue run-rate as of March 2021. The company grew extremely quickly and profitably by focusing on PLG paired with self-service purchasing (I&#8217;m a big fan of their approach to <a href="https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/your-guide-to-product-led-marketing?utm_source=url">product-led marketing</a>). </p><p>Now Zapier is turning to sales-assist to help fuel its next phase of growth.

Even though upmarket customers had everything they needed to self-serve, many of them just weren&#8217;t doing it. A purely self-service model wasn&#8217;t going to cut it if Zapier wanted to achieve the scale of success that they had seen with down-market customers. </p><p>Zapier contemplated adding in a sales team; however, there were many open questions about how that team should look and whether it would improve upon Zapier&#8217;s already successful self-service motion. As Steeve contemplated sales at Zapier, he followed a four step process: (1) understand the customer journey, (2) validate that sales improves on natural growth, (3) define the right plays, and (4) be thoughtful about compensation and operations.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://kylepoyar.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Kyle Poyar&#8217;s Growth Unhinged!

He became Zapier&#8217;s first sales rep, a role Steeve held for about six months. His first objective was to learn as much as possible about the upmarket customer&#8217;s buying process:</p><ul><li><p>Why weren&#8217;t they comfortable self-serving into the product?</p></li><li><p>How do they go through the process of buying a product like Zapier? What approvals were required?</p></li><li><p>How did they need to purchase a product like Zapier? Could they use a credit card?</p></li><li><p>Where did customers get stuck or have questions? </p></li></ul><p>He discovered things that might seem intuitive for traditionally sales-focused companies. Some folks had to go through several layers of approval and struggled to navigate that on their own. Others were hesitant to put $7,000+ on a credit card and wanted a different billing mechanism. And some just wanted to talk to someone at Zapier to make sure they would be supported through implementation and beyond.</p><p><strong>Step 2 - Validate that sales improves on natural growth</strong></p><p>Zapier didn&#8217;t want to add salespeople for the sake of adding sales; they wanted to demonstrate that sales actually <em>improved </em>on their baseline metrics relative to self-service. In the first 90 days, were folks who went through guided onboarding setting up more zaps, inviting more people on the account, activating more workflows, etc.? Were existing self-service customers who worked with an account manager more likely to expand their spend with Zapier than those who didn&#8217;t?</p><p>By being thoughtful about Zapier&#8217;s experimentation process, Steeve started to gain confidence in the benefits of a sales motion and what would happen if they replicated it. He found that sales touchpoints weren&#8217;t just helpful for converting upmarket accounts, but even improved retention rates post-purchase because Zapier was able to gather so much more information on who these customers were and what they needed.</p><p>The cherry on top: additional customer touchpoints created a powerful feedback loop that fed back into the product, allowing Zapier to improve the experience for self-service accounts as well. </p><p><strong>Step 3 - Define the right plays</strong></p><p>In product-led sales, the goal is to engage the <em>right accounts</em> at the <em>right time</em> with the <em>right message</em> based on what you know about them. That can be extremely daunting when you&#8217;re starting from scratch.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7786d3c-7955-4fe6-b0be-c4541b001d8f_670x450.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7786d3c-7955-4fe6-b0be-c4541b001d8f_670x450.png" width="534" height="358.65671641791045" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d7786d3c-7955-4fe6-b0be-c4541b001d8f_670x450.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:450,&quot;width&quot;:670,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:534,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7786d3c-7955-4fe6-b0be-c4541b001d8f_670x450.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7786d3c-7955-4fe6-b0be-c4541b001d8f_670x450.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7786d3c-7955-4fe6-b0be-c4541b001d8f_670x450.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7786d3c-7955-4fe6-b0be-c4541b001d8f_670x450.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><a href="https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/your-guide-to-pqls?utm_source=url">PQL maturity curve</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Steeve&#8217;s team started looking closely at different signals that might qualify a customer for a sales-assisted experience. One big qualifying factor was a simple one: <em>they actually expressed interest by requesting a demo</em>. Zapier isn&#8217;t gated behind a demo; a demo is an opt-in decision that the customer makes.</p><p>If the customer doesn&#8217;t initially request a demo, Zapier now uses a few different metrics to qualify an account as a Product Qualified Lead (PQL):</p><ul><li><p><em>Multi-player use: </em>Are there multiple active users on a specific domain using Zapier?</p></li><li><p><em>Usage patterns: </em>Is the account growing its usage over time? Are they seeing seasonal variability in usage?</p></li><li><p><em>Use case: </em>Does the customer&#8217;s use case for Zapier - defined based on the depth and variety of apps they&#8217;re using - indicate that they&#8217;d benefit from assistance?</p></li><li><p><em>Role: </em>Does the user&#8217;s role align with Zapier&#8217;s ideal customer profile and where Zapier sees the most success (ex: marketing and marketing operations)?</p></li></ul><p>Zapier&#8217;s sales-assist reps then tailor their outreach based on the user&#8217;s context in order to add as much value as possible. For example, if an account has multiple users on a domain, the rep might suggest consolidating those users into a corporate account, which allows folks to collaborate and lets them benefit from a pooled usage allotment.</p><p><strong>Step 4 - Be thoughtful about compensation and operations</strong></p><p>Steeve paid special attention to hiring the right types of individuals. He wasn&#8217;t just looking for past SaaS sales experience; he was looking for experience with the Zapier product. It was important for candidates to be comfortable using Zapier, able to brainstorm with different customers, and be genuinely curious individuals. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb66ad048-2cfe-42ff-bf15-e186d947e150_469x754.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb66ad048-2cfe-42ff-bf15-e186d947e150_469x754.png" width="507" height="815.091684434968" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b66ad048-2cfe-42ff-bf15-e186d947e150_469x754.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:754,&quot;width&quot;:469,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:507,&quot;bytes&quot;:76808,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb66ad048-2cfe-42ff-bf15-e186d947e150_469x754.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb66ad048-2cfe-42ff-bf15-e186d947e150_469x754.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb66ad048-2cfe-42ff-bf15-e186d947e150_469x754.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb66ad048-2cfe-42ff-bf15-e186d947e150_469x754.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Snapshot of Zapier&#8217;s Sales-Assist Representative <a href="https://zapier.com/jobs/5862031002/sales-assist-representative-ii/">job description</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>In the initial stages of testing sales-assist, Steeve made the decision to compensate everyone on a 100% base structure. That way team members wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about variable commissions and could instead prioritize setting a strong foundation. He wanted to encourage feedback loops with product, marketing, billing and legal as well as documenting winning motions that made sense for the team. Individuals are rewarded based on <em>team success</em>, measured on a quarterly basis, rather than their own quota retirement. </p><p>One counterintuitive winning motion at Zapier came from creating a feedback loop between customer support (called Customer Champions) and sales-assist. With support being on the frontlines interacting with thousands of users, Zapier looked for ways to pass relevant accounts from support to sales-assist. That needed to happen in a natural way; Zapier didn&#8217;t want users to feel artificially pressured or upsold. The company now generates a steady stream of Support Qualified Leads eager to talk to sales.</p><p>This process has clearly paid off for Zapier. They&#8217;ve already scaled the sales-assist team from 1 to 10 people, and it&#8217;s one of the fastest growing teams within the company. The future of sales-assist at Zapier is bright.</p><h2>More sales-assist resources:</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/product-led-sales/">Your product sells itself.

Every other week I take a closer look at what drives a SaaS company&#8217;s growth. Expect deep dive takes on SaaS pricing, product-led growth, public company benchmarks, and much more.</em></p><p>Attention marketers: product-led growth (PLG) isn&#8217;t taking your job. Unless you can&#8217;t adapt to <em>product-led</em> marketing, that is.</p><p>Before you can create a PLG flywheel, you have to get users for the product. Those users act as the foundation for all of your product growth efforts and it&#8217;s harder than ever to attract them in a noisy world.  </p><p>But product-led marketing doesn&#8217;t look like traditional B2B marketing. You aren&#8217;t doing account-based marketing aimed at a highly curated pool of executive buyers in your ICP. </p><p>Product-led marketing is about reaching a broad swath of potential end users who experience a pain that your product helps to solve. Look for low-cost, highly scalable launches that seamlessly connect with your product and create value for the user. This helps you build trust and credibility to nudge users to give your product a try.</p><p>Look at HubSpot, the CRM platform with a $22 billion market cap, for inspiration. HubSpot&#8217;s top three ways of attracting new users are word of mouth (33%), Google (26%) and HubSpot&#8217;s blog (13%), according to the company&#8217;s <a href="https://ir.hubspot.com/events">Q3 2021 Investor Presentation</a>.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73546a4d-cb49-40a1-9530-878c65529b1a_1636x755.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73546a4d-cb49-40a1-9530-878c65529b1a_1636x755.png" width="592" height="273.2307692307692" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/73546a4d-cb49-40a1-9530-878c65529b1a_1636x755.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:672,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:592,&quot;bytes&quot;:204284,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73546a4d-cb49-40a1-9530-878c65529b1a_1636x755.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73546a4d-cb49-40a1-9530-878c65529b1a_1636x755.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73546a4d-cb49-40a1-9530-878c65529b1a_1636x755.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F73546a4d-cb49-40a1-9530-878c65529b1a_1636x755.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Source: HubSpot Q3 2021 Investor Presentation</figcaption></figure></div><p>Word of mouth is fantastic, but it takes both time and traction before it really kicks in. In the early days your best bet is to lean on organic search (SEO) paired with quality content. Easy to say, hard to do. </p><p>To help out I&#8217;ve compiled my favorite product-led marketing approaches with examples from well-known companies like Hotjar, Zapier, Miro, Ahrefs, SafetyCulture and Grammarly. Repurpose one or more of these approaches to kickstart your PLG flywheel. </p><p><em>Special thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nigel-stevens-67218068/">Nigel Stevens</a>, CEO &amp; Growth Lead at Organic Growth Marketing, for providing advice and examples. </em></p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>1 - Template gallery </strong></h2><p>Many horizonal PLG products can be used in a myriad of ways to accomplish different things depending on the user&#8217;s goals. </p><p>Zapier, for example, built a software tool that helps users connect apps and automate workflows. But that value proposition doesn&#8217;t mean all that much if I&#8217;m a marketer who only wants to turn a Typeform contact into a HubSpot record or if I&#8217;m a sales rep who only wants to trigger a Slack message if an invitee cancels a meeting via Calendly. </p><p>If I&#8217;m that marketer or that sales rep, I don&#8217;t know I need an app connection or workflow automation tool. I just know that I have a problem that should be solved with technology. </p><p>That&#8217;s where templates come into play. Templates help you attract a wide variety of potential users by showing how you help them achieve <em>their </em>specific goal in <em>their </em>own language. There are two flavors of templates:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Programmatic templates: </strong>For example, &#8220;How to do X+Y&#8221; pages. Not much content is needed - just enough to convey value and the context of how you help a user achieve their goal.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bespoke templates: </strong>You actually create your own templates along with content around them. </p></li></ul><p>Zapier has mastered the art of the programmatic template play. They&#8217;ve built templates for every app they support, every app-to-app integration, and every major workflow for connecting the apps together. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00ca7649-710f-462f-8e01-d35137509a84_1240x900.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00ca7649-710f-462f-8e01-d35137509a84_1240x900.png" width="566" height="410.80645161290323" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/00ca7649-710f-462f-8e01-d35137509a84_1240x900.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:900,&quot;width&quot;:1240,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:566,&quot;bytes&quot;:115766,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00ca7649-710f-462f-8e01-d35137509a84_1240x900.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00ca7649-710f-462f-8e01-d35137509a84_1240x900.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00ca7649-710f-462f-8e01-d35137509a84_1240x900.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00ca7649-710f-462f-8e01-d35137509a84_1240x900.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><a href="https://zapier.com/apps/calendly/integrations/slack">Sample Zapier template</a> for connecting Calendly and Slack</figcaption></figure></div><p>These templates have of course been optimized for easy discovery on Google.

it:</p><ul><li><p>They start by addressing the high-level intent of the visitor (&#8220;what is a heatmap?&#8221;)</p></li><li><p>They challenge the visitor&#8217;s question and raise the stakes (&#8220;here&#8217;s why you&#8217;re wrong and need to rethink it&#8221;)</p></li><li><p>They address the broad range of related questions that folks have (examples of heatmaps, how to analyze it, how to create it, who invented it, how to use it on a WordPress site)</p></li></ul><p>They&#8217;ve paid close attention to breaking a detailed and complex topic into bite-sized, digestible chunks that users can navigate in their own way. Hotjar regularly updates the guide with more information; it was last updated 5 days ago.</p><p>Throughout the process they&#8217;re essentially funneling users through their product: what it does, why it&#8217;s important, and how to use it. It would be a no-brainer to give it a try.</p><h2><strong>3 - Benchmark and trend data</strong></h2><p>What does your product have that nobody else has? Real-time data.</p><p>Everyone wants to keep a pulse on what&#8217;s happening in their industry including trends and how they stack up to their peers. You might be sitting on a treasure trove of such information without even realizing it.</p><p>Another great organic marketing play is to create (then regularly update) a set of dashboards and insights connected to your product data. While this data may not rank highly in SEO at first, it&#8217;s a great way to generate backlinks from other websites and it&#8217;s something that gets frequently shared. Even better, it provides a well-spring of insights that can be repurposed for PR, blog posts, newsletters, etc.</p><p>ShipBob, the tech-enabled eCommerce fulfillment company, makes for a great example with their daily eCommerce trends analysis. The data has been aggregated and anonymized, then cataloged based on industry vertical. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce48b72f-f4e2-48bf-b8d3-1b24a7dc99e9_584x359.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce48b72f-f4e2-48bf-b8d3-1b24a7dc99e9_584x359.png" width="526" height="323.34589041095893" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ce48b72f-f4e2-48bf-b8d3-1b24a7dc99e9_584x359.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:359,&quot;width&quot;:584,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:526,&quot;bytes&quot;:82874,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce48b72f-f4e2-48bf-b8d3-1b24a7dc99e9_584x359.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce48b72f-f4e2-48bf-b8d3-1b24a7dc99e9_584x359.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce48b72f-f4e2-48bf-b8d3-1b24a7dc99e9_584x359.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce48b72f-f4e2-48bf-b8d3-1b24a7dc99e9_584x359.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><a href="https://trends.shipbob.com/">ShipBob eCommerce sales trends by vertical</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>You can test out the appetite for your product data through benchmark or state of the industry reports.

The best ones - like Twilio&#8217;s - are written in a neutral way (read: not sales-y), are easy to navigate, and reinforce the value proposition of your product. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95693d79-ae62-46ed-aa4e-88dcf33da1be_1920x1020.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95693d79-ae62-46ed-aa4e-88dcf33da1be_1920x1020.png" width="674" height="358.29395604395603" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/95693d79-ae62-46ed-aa4e-88dcf33da1be_1920x1020.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:774,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:674,&quot;bytes&quot;:416725,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95693d79-ae62-46ed-aa4e-88dcf33da1be_1920x1020.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95693d79-ae62-46ed-aa4e-88dcf33da1be_1920x1020.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95693d79-ae62-46ed-aa4e-88dcf33da1be_1920x1020.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95693d79-ae62-46ed-aa4e-88dcf33da1be_1920x1020.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms">Twilio SMS documentation</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Too often these are treated as the exclusive purview of the Engineering org.

I recommend brainstorming a list of several potential ideas and then running some quick diligence to vet which one(s) has the most promise. Ask yourself:</p><ul><li><p>Will this campaign reach <em>users </em>of my product and not just <em>executive buyers</em>?</p></li><li><p>How common are the user pain point(s) that we would solve? What&#8217;s the search volume around related terms?</p><ul><li><p>If you don&#8217;t see much search volume data, do you have a good reason to believe that there <em>are </em>people looking for this - or that the demand will come with time?</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Where is there white space that my competition hasn&#8217;t addressed? How can we stand out from the crowd?</p></li><li><p>How strong is the connection between the campaign idea and what our product does so that users will naturally want to sign up for the product?</p></li></ul><p>From there, try spinning up a proof-of-concept. Monitor the response then keep expanding on what works. Don&#8217;t be discouraged if results take some time; you&#8217;re developing an audience that will grow over time and each incremental sign up won&#8217;t cost anything. That&#8217;s the magic of product-led marketing.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Your guide to PLG & community]]></title><description><![CDATA[It's way more than launching a Slack group]]></description><link>https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/your-guide-to-plg-and-community</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/your-guide-to-plg-and-community</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Kyle Poyar]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 09 Feb 2022 12:29:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8345141-6bb3-4e84-a754-760d8a618278_1280x720.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#128075;&nbsp;<em>Hi, I&#8217;m&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-poyar/">Kyle</a> from <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/">OpenView</a><a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a>&nbsp;and welcome to my newsletter,&nbsp;<a href="https://kylepoyar.substack.com/">Growth Unhinged</a>. Every other week I take a closer look at what drives a SaaS company&#8217;s growth. Expect deep dive takes on SaaS pricing, product-led growth, benchmarks, and much more.</em></p><p>In a product-led (PLG) business, some of the tried-and-true SaaS growth tactics aren&#8217;t at your disposal.</p><p>Since you&#8217;re initially focused on users rather than executive buyers, outbound cold calling loses its effectiveness (although that may change as you scale). Since users can get started for free, you can&#8217;t always afford to outbid your competitors on search and other paid channels. </p><p>But your end user focus is actually your biggest advantage, and it&#8217;s a growth lever hiding in plain sight. That&#8217;s where community comes into play.</p><p>Community is an incredible multiplier on a PLG strategy. In my opinion, a community strategy can be applied to nearly every PLG business; the question is finding the <em>right</em> community strategy. Community is a win-win on so many levels: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Marketing: </strong>It helps you reach new and untapped audiences who are highly qualified because they&#8217;ve interacted with current users.</p></li><li><p><strong>Product: </strong>It adds value to your existing users by helping them be more successful, both with the product and in their working life.</p></li><li><p><strong>Customer Success: </strong>It creates stickiness by increasing the switching costs associated with changing products.</p></li><li><p><strong>Finance: </strong>It doesn&#8217;t need to cost much to get started. </p></li></ul><p>But what is a &#8220;community&#8221; anyway and how should a founder implement a community strategy for the first time? Hot take: it&#8217;s way more complex than just launching a Slack group. </p><p>I&#8217;ll break down fascinating non-Slack community plays to get inspired by and elaborate on two community + PLG case studies: Notion and Productboard.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8345141-6bb3-4e84-a754-760d8a618278_1280x720.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8345141-6bb3-4e84-a754-760d8a618278_1280x720.png" width="1280" height="720" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b8345141-6bb3-4e84-a754-760d8a618278_1280x720.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:720,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:74640,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8345141-6bb3-4e84-a754-760d8a618278_1280x720.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8345141-6bb3-4e84-a754-760d8a618278_1280x720.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8345141-6bb3-4e84-a754-760d8a618278_1280x720.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8345141-6bb3-4e84-a754-760d8a618278_1280x720.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">PLG &amp; Community strategies and examples</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Special thanks to Ben Lang (Head of Community, Notion) and Scott Baldwin (Community Lead and Product Evangelist, Productboard) for sharing their insights.</em></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/your-guide-to-plg-and-community?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/your-guide-to-plg-and-community?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>1 - Amplify community creators</h2><p>Your best users find new and creative ways of using your product to power their own working lives. After spending hours on their creations, these users are often excited to share their work back with others. </p><p>This community sharing tends to happen organically and seemingly spontaneously. You can amplify it to reach new users and inspire existing users to do more with your product. </p><p>Notion, the team workspace <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/10/08/notion-raises-at-10-billion-valuation-boosted-by-remote-work-tiktok/?sh=672e51864900">now valued at an eye-popping $10B</a>, makes a great case study. </p><p>Ben Lang discovered Notion on Product Hunt well before the product had taken off and become a household name. After using Notion for a couple of days, he was blown away by the power of what he could create. That&#8217;s when Ben decided to tweet his Notion setup and start building a template gallery for other users to do the same. Not long after, Ben&#8217;s template gallery side project was attracting as many as 70,000 visits per month. </p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/benln/status/1034475232445181952&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;I've just about moved my *entire* life into <span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>@NotionHQ</span>. &quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;benln&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Ben Lang&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Tue Aug 28 16:18:09 +0000 2018&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[{&quot;img_url&quot;:&quot;https://pbs.substack.com/media/DlsxhxpV4AEboG4.jpg&quot;,&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;https://t.co/ZCyAARadhQ&quot;,&quot;alt_text&quot;:null}],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:45,&quot;like_count&quot;:946,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null}"><a href="https://twitter.com/benln/status/1034475232445181952" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-user-avatar" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/twitter_name/w_36/benln.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @benln"><span class="tweet-author-name">Ben Lang </span><span class="tweet-author">@benln</span></div>I've just about moved my *entire* life into <span class="tweet-fake-link">@NotionHQ</span>. <div class="tweet-photos-container"><div class="tweet-photo-wrapper "><img class="tweet-photo" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.substack.com%2Fmedia%2FDlsxhxpV4AEboG4.jpg" alt="Image"></div></div></a><a href="https://twitter.com/benln/status/1034475232445181952" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-footer"><p class="tweet-date">August 28th 2018</p><span class="retweets"><span class="rt-count">45</span> Retweets</span><span class="likes"><span class="like-count">946</span> Likes</span></div></a></div><p>All of that took place before Ben ever formally connected with the Notion team. But it wasn&#8217;t long before Notion recruited him to join full-time as Head of Community and one of the first 10 or so employees.</p><p>Since then Ben and his team have doubled down on amplifying Notion creators and superfans. Their <a href="https://www.notion.so/notion/Notion-Community-04f306fbf59a413fae15f42e2a1ab029#3f492dd852454f079c3a880a9b2b640c">community efforts</a> include:</p><ul><li><p>Building out the <a href="https://www.notion.so/templates">Template Gallery</a> on Notion&#8217;s website (pro-tip: these are great for top-of-funnel SEO).</p></li><li><p>Starting an Ambassador program to connect superfans with the company and each other.</p></li><li><p>Encouraging the community to create their own spaces to connect and learn from each other. Notion&#8217;s community run groups (all started by Ambassadors) reach hundreds of thousands of users (ex: Notion Vietnam has 200k members).</p></li><li><p>Sponsoring social media influencers who have large followings on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok and are keen to share what they&#8217;ve made.</p></li></ul><p>Even now that Notion&#8217;s community efforts have taken off, Ben&#8217;s team is still pushing further in new and creative areas. For example, Notion has recently leaned into helping creators build a business with Notion through consulting, instructional courses, and premium templates that can be sold via the Template Gallery (<a href="https://www.notion.so/templates/content-os">here&#8217;s an example</a>).</p><blockquote><p><em>Other examples include the <a href="https://miro.com/miroverse/">Miroverse Community Template Gallery</a>, <a href="https://developer.servicenow.com/blog.do?p=/post/creatorcon22-cfc/">ServiceNow&#8217;s CreatorCon</a> developer community, <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/">Unity&#8217;s Asset Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.figma.com/community">Figma&#8217;s community plug-ins</a>.</em></p></blockquote><h2>2 - Connect users with their peers</h2><p>Many SaaS companies build products for one specific function or industry. That level of focus allows them to play a unique role in the working lives of their users: that of the <em>connector</em>. </p><p>Playing the role of connector helps existing users become more successful and helps attract prospective users who want to replicate this success. </p><p>From my vantage point, connecting users with their peers is something that many companies try to do, but few truly succeed. It can be difficult for a SaaS company&#8217;s peer community to stand out when there are other 3rd party community organizations vying for attention. It can also be challenging to demonstrate ROI, especially since peer communities need to be seen as community-centric rather than commercially-motivated.</p><p>All that said, it&#8217;s relatively straightforward and cost-effective to get these peer communities off the ground. From there you can double down <em>if</em> and <em>when</em> you get sufficient pull from your community members.</p><p>Productboard, the product management platform and <a href="https://www.siliconrepublic.com/jobs-news/productboard-unicorn-dublin-double-staff-numbers">newly minted unicorn</a>, did exactly that.</p><p>The company&#8217;s community v1 was a <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/customer-centricity-strategic-product-roadmap/">Slack workspace built for product learning</a>; Productboard invited select customers to share feedback and ideas into the product roadmap. It wasn&#8217;t widely advertised or formally managed at first. Over time, this Slack group started taking on more and more use cases like support, customer success, and as a forum for users to share their experiences. </p><p>Scott Baldwin, now Productboard&#8217;s Community Lead and Product Evangelist, was one of the company&#8217;s very early customers. In fact, he watched the company present at TechCrunch Disrupt and bought it soon after. Not surprisingly, Scott was an active member of Productboard&#8217;s v1 Slack community. He then formally joined Productboard in 2020 with a mandate to amplify these peer community efforts and migrate off Slack. </p><p>Scott&#8217;s team decided to launch the <a href="https://www.productmakers.com/">Product Makers Community</a>, a standalone home for Productboard&#8217;s community members to connect and learn about product excellence. The Product Makers community includes a few different elements:</p><ul><li><p>Sub-groups (ex: womxn in product) for users to find their own tribe within the 3,000+ product makers.</p></li><li><p>&#8220;Meet a Maker&#8221; 1:1 match-making where users get automatically matched with other members for 1:1 video chats.</p></li><li><p>Regular roundtables and virtual events facilitated by community members.</p></li><li><p>An active discussion forum that&#8217;s categorized and searchable. </p></li></ul><p>To measure success, Scott and his team monitor acquisition and engagement: size of the community, growth in membership, active usage, attracting non-customers as members. The end goal is to generate an ongoing pool Community Qualified Leads (CQLs), similar to <a href="https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/your-guide-to-pqls">Product Qualified Leads (PQLs)</a> but identified based on community activity instead of product activity.</p><blockquote><p><em>Other examples include <a href="https://www.procore.com/network/">Procore&#8217;s Construction Network</a>, which connects contractors, architects, engineers, and suppliers to work together on projects, and <a href="https://www.pocus.com/community">Pocus&#8217;s invite-only Product-Led Sales Community</a>.</em></p></blockquote><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://kylepoyar.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;}"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Kyle Poyar&#8217;s Growth Unhinged!

These products have millions of active users who frequent the companies&#8217; content, marketplace, and events. By becoming a trusted voice in these existing communities, you&#8217;ll benefit from the years of investments that have already been made.</p><p>Perhaps the area where this approach has been leveraged to the greatest extent is the Shopify marketplace and community, which counts 1.7 million businesses that have collectively made &gt;$200 billion USD in sales. </p><p>Klaviyo, a customer data and marketing automation platform valued at over $9B, is one Shopify-adjacent success story. Other examples include Yotpo (reviews and loyalty), Privy (pop ups), Spocket (drop shipping), and Postscript (SMS marketing). </p><p>First and foremost, Klaviyo has made significant investments into its presence on <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/klaviyo-email-marketing">Shopify&#8217;s App Store</a>, generating nearly 1,500 reviews and making it free to install for a Shopify&#8217;s merchant&#8217;s first 250 contacts. They&#8217;ve also invested in an extremely detailed help center and content around connecting Shopify and Klaviyo. Meanwhile Klaviyo has partnered with Shopify influencers to promote how to use the products together (one YouTube video alone has generated over 53,000 views). It&#8217;s no surprise that the company was extremely well positioned when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/22/mailchimp-and-shopify-break-up/">Shopify removed Mailchimp&#8217;s integration</a> from its marketplace in 2019, leaving many Shopify merchants eager for a new solution.</p><blockquote><p><em>Other examples include the Slack App Directory, Google&#8217;s Chrome extension Web Store, Apple&#8217;s App Store, and HubSpot App Marketplace. </em></p></blockquote><h2>4 - Build a content community</h2><p>Another underrated community strategy: technical content. </p><p>You don&#8217;t need to be a BuzzFeed listicle connoisseur to know that content is inherently viral. Folks have ideas that they want to disseminate. Others consume those ideas and want to talk about them with their peers, share them with colleagues, or respond to them with their own perspective.</p><p>A content community helps attract and engage with an audience, which is an important foundation for any broader community strategy. It also establishes your brand as a trusted voice in your industry and genuinely adds value for your target users. Plus it&#8217;s something you can both measure and connect back to your product itself, creating a tighter attribution between investment and impact compared to other community strategies.</p><p>DigitalOcean, the developer cloud company valued at $6B+, has built one of my favorite content communities and has attracted &gt;1 million developers in the process. </p><p>Instead of writing &#8220;articles&#8221; or &#8220;blog posts&#8221;, DigitalOcean has tutorials. These are evergreen guides about topics broad and narrow, basic and advanced. They get updated regularly and build on each other over time. While &#8220;How To Code in JavaScript&#8221; might not seem like the most new or exciting topic, DigitalOcean&#8217;s tutorial has attracted 8.3 million views (per the company&#8217;s website) and allows readers to explore 30+ sub-tutorials to go deeper.</p><p>As DigitalOcean&#8217;s content community reached a broader audience, the company was able to introduce its <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/pages/write-for-digitalocean">DOnations program</a> where authors get paid for contributing a new DigitalOcean tutorial. Payouts can range from $75 to $400 each. Beyond the payout, contributors get help honing their writing skills and get to showcase their knowledge to hundreds of thousands of their peers. Community-generated content helps bring new members into the community, setting up a community powered growth flywheel. </p><blockquote><p><em>Other content community examples include <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/marketing-and-plg-unlocking-the-opportunity-for-growth/">Twilio&#8217;s Documentation</a>, HashiCorp Learn, Drift Insider, and the Applitools Test Automation University.</em></p></blockquote><h2>5 - Acquire an established community</h2><p>Why create your own community if someone else has already done it for you?</p><p>I&#8217;m starting to see more SaaS companies acquire (or acqui-hire) an independent media entity rather than build their own from scratch. </p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/dharmesh/status/1313859320493285376&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Modern media companies have a software company embedded inside.\n\nNext-gen software companies will have a media company embedded inside.&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;dharmesh&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;dharmesh&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Wed Oct 07 15:10:46 +0000 2020&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:73,&quot;like_count&quot;:301,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null}"><a href="https://twitter.com/dharmesh/status/1313859320493285376" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-user-avatar" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/twitter_name/w_36/dharmesh.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @dharmesh"><span class="tweet-author-name">dharmesh </span><span class="tweet-author">@dharmesh</span></div>Modern media companies have a software company embedded inside.

Meanwhile SaaS companies tend to be excellent a monetizing an audience, but struggle to cost effectively scale their audience over time.</p><p>While the acquisition route can be enticing, it&#8217;s not usually the best starting point for the average SaaS company. It&#8217;s lower risk to begin by partnering with these communities and piloting your own efforts before diving head first into an unknown acquisition.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Advice for getting started</h2><p>Regardless of which direction you choose, you need to start your efforts with the right mindset. Think of it as building <em>with </em>your community rather than <em>for </em>the community, Scott Baldwin urged. Then extend community efforts one step at a time based on input and feedback from your constituents. </p><p>Attribution will a challenge; don&#8217;t expect community initiatives to have an immediate or measurable ROI attached to them. Focus instead on what you can control: community engagement. </p><ul><li><p>How many people are participating? </p></li><li><p>How sustained is their participation? </p></li><li><p>How often are existing community members bringing in new members?</p></li></ul><p>As you crack the code on engagement, start to create your own definition of a Community Qualified Lead (CQL) and measure their journey through the funnel.</p><p>Resourcing and prioritization will always be a challenge. As with any fast growing company, you will likely have more ideas than you have available resources. </p><p>The good news is that you don&#8217;t need a massive team to get started. It&#8217;s usually best to stay lean and test new programs as an MVP, leaning on existing team members, contractors, and freelancers for support. Then hire dedicated program managers to double down on what works.</p><p>Pro-tip: your early adopter community members are a great pool for finding community talent.</p><div class="footnote" id="footnote-1"><a href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p><a href="https://openview.vc/3rzBhqk">This newsletter originally appeared on the OpenView blog.</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Your guide to self-serve onboarding]]></title><description><![CDATA[How to get your product to sell itself]]></description><link>https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/your-guide-to-self-serve-onboarding</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/your-guide-to-self-serve-onboarding</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Kyle Poyar]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jan 2022 12:30:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67a0135-cd10-4e28-984e-34ab8e1f6687_600x500.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#128075;&nbsp;<em>Hi, I&#8217;m&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-poyar/">Kyle</a> from <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/">OpenView</a>&nbsp;and welcome to my newsletter,&nbsp;<a href="https://kylepoyar.substack.com/">Growth Unhinged</a>.

But PLG isn&#8217;t only a pricing change; it&#8217;s a mindset shift. It means designing for the end user and helping those users see value as quickly as possible.</p><p>A new user is missing so much context that you might take for granted; even the basics like who your product is for and what it does. You never get this feedback from folks who abandon your product unless you&#8217;re intentional about seeking it out.</p><blockquote><p><em>What to do next:</em> <em>Ask new employees to sign up for your product and have them screen share as they do. You&#8217;ll be blown away by what you find.</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>2 - You have too much of a blank slate.</strong></p><p>If everything&#8217;s empty in your product, it&#8217;s hard to visualize the promised land of what&#8217;s possible. </p><p>The best SaaS companies know exactly what they want new users to accomplish on their first day and get them excited to do it. These companies will expose additional capabilities later as they become relevant to users. </p><p>Zenefits, the people operations software, shows how easy it is to onboard a new employee through the platform. They then take this in-product guidance a step further by allowing a user to see how it looks in a live, interactive demo environment (right hand side). Seeing the potential end state helps motivate users to complete the set-up required to get there.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fedccd736-7cb1-4a3e-bab7-99d91c7fe564_800x340.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fedccd736-7cb1-4a3e-bab7-99d91c7fe564_800x340.png" width="800" height="340" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/edccd736-7cb1-4a3e-bab7-99d91c7fe564_800x340.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:340,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:76578,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fedccd736-7cb1-4a3e-bab7-99d91c7fe564_800x340.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fedccd736-7cb1-4a3e-bab7-99d91c7fe564_800x340.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fedccd736-7cb1-4a3e-bab7-99d91c7fe564_800x340.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fedccd736-7cb1-4a3e-bab7-99d91c7fe564_800x340.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Zenefits product onboarding example</figcaption></figure></div><p>Miro, the visual collaboration software, doesn&#8217;t even have a blank slate in their product.

Alternatively, pin the product tour so users can go back to it later.</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>6 - You make it *too* easy to sign up.</strong> </p><p>Wait, isn&#8217;t the goal of PLG to make it super easy for a user to try your product?</p><p>Hear me out on this one.</p><p>Many companies have poured resources into conversion optimization as a way to generate as many sign-ups as possible. For example, maybe they added an option to sign-up with an email from the homepage or perhaps they added an option to log-in through Google rather than create a new account. </p><p>In many cases these companies celebrate their acceleration in sign-up growth only to realize later that the extra sign-ups never translated into more customers or revenue. (Pro-tip: many of these extra sign-ups might have actually been bots.)</p><p>There are two paths to proceed if you run into this problem. </p><p>First is to provide more nurturing, context, and community outside of your product in order to turn low-intent visitors into high-intent users. </p><p>The second is to redesign your onboarding so that you have a path for low-intent users who aren&#8217;t yet ready to activate, let alone purchase your product. Videos and best practice guides go a long way.</p><blockquote><p><em>What to do next: Ditch sign-ups as a core marketing KPI and replace it with <a href="https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/plg-saas-metrics">activated sign-ups</a>, which creates a stronger alignment between marketing and product. Then revisit your onboarding flow with the mindset of a low-intent user in order to spot opportunities to add more educational resources at pivotal moments.</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>7 - You send mixed and confusing messages.</strong></p><p>We&#8217;ve all been there. You signed up for a product only to get bombarded by a chaotic array of touchpoints spanning in-product chat, sales rep outreach, company announcements, marketing emails, and so on. You tried to unsubscribe but somehow the messages kept coming anyway. </p><p>From a vendor standpoint, each of these touchpoints has a clear purpose otherwise it wouldn&#8217;t have been introduced. But collectively they make it hard for users to focus on what matters.</p><blockquote><p><em>What to do next: Document every touchpoint that a new user receives in their first two weeks and then map those touchpoints on a timeline. Use those learnings to streamline the user journey and kill touchpoints that aren&#8217;t additive. Bonus points if you can shift towards contextual, trigger-based touchpoints personalized to a given user.</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>Bonus - You aren&#8217;t personalized.</strong></p><p>I intentionally left this off my list of mistakes because it doesn&#8217;t necessarily apply to every product. That said, personalization can be an extremely powerful way of taking your self-serve onboarding to the next level.</p><p>Users come to your product with different contexts, jobs they&#8217;re trying to do, and levels of familiarity with related software tools. So why should they all go through the same onboarding path?</p><p>Shopify, the eCommerce software company, asks users several upfront questions in order to segment them into a specific onboarding flow. One of these questions is &#8220;are you already selling?&#8221;, which identifies whether the user wants to migrate from an existing eCommerce platform or is starting from scratch. </p><p>Another question is &#8220;which industry will you be operating in?&#8221;, which can greatly impact the type of online presence that&#8217;s right for them. Shopify has a set of templates, themes, and examples tailored to whether the business is in home and d&#233;cor, art, food and drink, or something else entirely.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35bb0e21-7983-48ef-802f-03ea012f7a8d_472x331.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35bb0e21-7983-48ef-802f-03ea012f7a8d_472x331.png" width="472" height="331" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/35bb0e21-7983-48ef-802f-03ea012f7a8d_472x331.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:331,&quot;width&quot;:472,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:25920,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35bb0e21-7983-48ef-802f-03ea012f7a8d_472x331.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35bb0e21-7983-48ef-802f-03ea012f7a8d_472x331.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35bb0e21-7983-48ef-802f-03ea012f7a8d_472x331.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35bb0e21-7983-48ef-802f-03ea012f7a8d_472x331.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Shopify product onboarding example</figcaption></figure></div><blockquote><p><em>What to do next: If it&#8217;s relevant for your product, list out the most common use cases across your customers.

Common stages include: (a) sign-up, (b) qualified, (c) activated, (d) PQL, (e) paid customer.</p></li><li><p><em>Experimenting with different iterations: </em>Regardless of how much preparation you put in, your best ideas won&#8217;t always work in practice.

Treating PQLs as one-size-fits-all would miss the point.  </p><p>Savvy operators carve out at least three buckets of PQLs based on what a given account needs in order to move to the next step in their customer journey.</p><ol><li><p><em>Hand-raiser PQLs</em> - High-intent users who actively want to talk to sales. Depending on the volume of hand-raisers, you may want to screen these based on fit with your ideal customer profile (ICP) so they&#8217;re worth your sales team&#8217;s time. </p></li><li><p><em>Usage-based PQLs - </em>High-engagement users who take specific product actions that correlate with conversion. For example, maybe a user hit a usage limit but didn&#8217;t immediately convert. Usage-based PQLs are usually calculated as a score (similar to MQLs) and you may want to prioritize starting with those who have the highest PQL score. </p></li><li><p><em>Needs-help PQLs - </em>High-value accounts where there&#8217;s product-led groundswell, but where there&#8217;s likely a more complex buying cycle and users would get stuck without assistance. These could also be expansion opportunities after there&#8217;s already been some small self-service purchase. These are calculated using a combination of the PQL score and ideal customer profile (ICP) score.</p></li></ol><p>In order to identify PQLs across these three buckets, operators look at several different signals:</p><ul><li><p><em>Product attainment</em> (usage frequency, adoption of high-value features, usage growth WoW / MoM, completed Y activation steps, multi-product usage, etc.) </p></li><li><p><em>Firmographic information</em> (company size, user title, location, etc.; often enriched with 3rd party tools like Clearbit or ZoomInfo)</p></li><li><p><em>CTA response </em>(clicks to request a demo, asks to talk to support, replies to an onboarding email, views the pricing page but doesn&#8217;t buy, etc.)</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><p><strong>What plays help convert PQLs into $$$?</strong></p><p>Your goal should be to develop a playbook with targeted plays depending on the type of PQL and what they need from you. </p><p>Outreach should occur across multiple channels including targeted sales conversations, lifecycle marketing, and in-product chat. </p><blockquote><p><em>In-product chat is underutilized by many companies in Melissa Ross&#8217;s experience, but is extremely effective because communication takes place in the moment the user is stuck.</em></p></blockquote><p>To be able to do this, Breezy Beaumont emphasized that you&#8217;ll need to have data at reps&#8217; fingertips so they know who&#8217;s using the product and how they&#8217;re using it. A personalized message sent at the right time can go a long way - and can get an extremely high response rate.</p><p>It can be a difficult balancing act between trying to help the customer use the product vs. trying to get them to pay for it according to Rob Falcone. </p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Skew too far toward the former, and you may miss opportunities to guide adoption, conversion, and expansion. Skew too far toward the latter, and your team will be viewed as commercially motivated and salesy, cheapening their product guidance.&#8221; </em>- Rob Falcone, Guru</p></blockquote><p>Some best practices recommended by operators:</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;We don&#8217;t ever mention a deal cycle or pricing tier in our early notes. We earn the right to have that conversation later by delivering a positive customer experience from the start.&#8221;</em> - Ben Davis, Air Labs</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;I&#8217;ve generally had a lot of success coaching teams to lead with curiosity. i.e. &#8216;Hi X, I saw you did Y, I&#8217;d love to have a conversation about what you&#8217;re trying to accomplish.&#8217;&#8221;</em> - Aaron Geller, Cypress</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Playbook example: when 3+ users at the same company reach a high usage threshold, send an email to the manager/potential buyer at that account and let them know the value their team is getting, offer a discounted team price and a team training session.&#8221;</em> - Breezy Beaumont, <a href="https://www.getcorrelated.com/">Correlated</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;We&#8217;ve mapped the relationship between product signals &lt;&gt; potential customer needs &lt;&gt; how an AE can help. This helps us draw inferences between what we&#8217;re seeing in product usage, and position exactly why speaking with an AE would be valuable.&#8221;</em> - Rob Falcone, Guru</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;I think the timeliness of outreach matters more with PQLs than other lead sources. It&#8217;s rare that someone who went to a conference and ended up on a lead list is actively waiting for you to reach out to them, but it&#8217;s not uncommon for a PQL to reply to sales outreach and say &#8216;we were just talking about your product!&#8217; Kind of a dream for sales.&#8221; </em>- Melissa Ross, Clockwise</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p><strong>Who engages with PQLs?</strong></p><p>Is &#8220;it depends&#8221; a helpful answer? &#129315;</p><p>In all seriousness, you should carve out different paths based on what that specific PQL needs in order to get to the next step in their journey as well as the potential deal size at stake. </p><p>Teams engaging with PQLs can include:</p><ul><li><p><em>Product specialists</em> (also called &#8216;Sales Assist&#8217; teams) who remove product friction </p></li><li><p><em>BDRs/SDRs</em> for initial qualification and outreach</p></li><li><p><em>Sales reps</em> (AEs or AMs) to close deals with PQL accounts</p></li><li><p><em>Customer success</em> (CSMs) to expand existing accounts </p></li><li><p><em>Marketing</em> for trigger-based nurture or lifecycle emails</p></li></ul><p>More mature companies usually split out the responsibilities between initial outreach and closing between two different teams. </p><ul><li><p><em>Initial outreach</em> comes from a more junior resource, either a product specialist / sales assist team (ex: for usage-based PQLs) or from BDRs/SDRs (for hand-raisers and needs-help PQLs).</p></li><li><p><em>Closing</em> is done by sales reps who receive qualified PQLs and help the customer navigate from a self-serve user to an enterprise customer. AEs are generally assigned based on either their respective territories/patches or a round-robin process.</p></li></ul><p>Alexa Grabell described the AE&#8217;s role as doing &#8220;everything that the product itself cannot do.&#8221;</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;AEs do everything that the product itself cannot do - communicate with various stakeholders to navigate additional layers of security, complex procurement processes, education on an enterprise rollout, a centralized billing plan, and more. In some organizations, the AE might also be responsible for identifying new use cases and seat expansion up to a certain threshold (before customer success takes over).&#8221;</em> - Alexa Grabell, <a href="https://www.pocus.com/">Pocus</a></p></blockquote><p>These efforts are usually owned by either Growth or RevOps who oversee the entire project including setting up the strategy, building the infrastructure, and integrating PQLs into the current MQL and sales process. </p><div><hr></div><p><strong>What technology helps you manage the PQL process?</strong></p><p>Up until now the technology to manage PQLs could be summed up as everyone&#8217;s favorite Facebook relationship status: &#8220;it&#8217;s complicated.&#8221; </p><p>Thankfully that&#8217;s changing with the rise of product-led sales technologies such as <a href="https://www.pocus.com/">Pocus</a>, <a href="https://www.getcorrelated.com/">Correlated</a>, <a href="https://www.headsup.ai/">HeadsUp</a>, <a href="https://www.bliinx.com/">Bliinx</a>, <a href="https://www.endgame.io/">Endgame</a>, <a href="https://www.toplyne.io/">Toplyne</a>, and others.</p><p>Tooling usually includes the following components:</p><ul><li><p>Store product events in a central data warehouse (ex: Snowflake, Redshift)</p></li><li><p>Set up reverse ETL to move data across systems (ex: Hightouch)</p></li><li><p>Analyze data &amp; identify usage patterns with a BI tool (ex: Looker)</p></li><li><p>Enrich data with firmographic information (ex: Clearbit, ZoomInfo)</p></li><li><p>Manage and orchestrate PQL notifications and outreach (ex: Pocus, Correlated)</p></li><li><p>Orchestrate email campaigns (ex: Outreach, Salesloft)</p></li><li><p>Manage customer relationships in CRM (ex: Salesforce, HubSpot) </p></li></ul><p>If you&#8217;re just getting started with PQLs, the bare minimum would include a central data warehouse, a CRM system, and tooling to send data from the warehouse to the CRM.</p><p>As product-led sales tools mature, they&#8217;ll help you offload and automate more of these additional jobs so that you can move as quickly as possible.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Closing thoughts</strong></p><p>Achieving PQL excellence will take time and significant investment.

Every other week I take a closer look at what drives a SaaS company&#8217;s growth.

And there&#8217;s more and more bifurcation between the &#8216;haves&#8217; &#8211; the fast growers &#8211; and the &#8216;have nots&#8217; of SaaS than ever before.</p><p>The &#8216;haves&#8217;, defined by growing quickly out of the gate and then maintaining 50% or faster revenue growth at significant scale, have seen their valuations skyrocket over the years. This is most visible among publicly traded companies.</p><p>For publicly traded companies that are growing 50% or faster, median valuation multiples have increased by an incredible 649% between 2015 and August 2021. Those growing by 10-30%, by comparison, have only seen multiples increase by 102% over that time period.&nbsp;</p><p>The new data reveals a similar picture for private SaaS startups.&nbsp;</p><p>OpenView has been tracking growth rates by ARR scale for four years running. Over the years median growth rates have stayed remarkably consistent (with a handful of exceptions). Even COVID-19 barely made a dent in the average growth trajectory.</p><p>But top performers have begun to far outpace their peers, especially for startups with less than $10M in ARR, and the gap between the &#8216;haves&#8217; and &#8216;have nots&#8217; has gotten wider than ever. In order for a $1-2.5M ARR business to be top quartile in 2021 they now need to be growing at 300% or faster. That&#8217;s triple the rate of 2020 (100%) and double that of 2019 (165%).&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F805330ff-02de-4ccb-b5d2-7351fce375d0_3829x2103.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F805330ff-02de-4ccb-b5d2-7351fce375d0_3829x2103.png" width="1456" height="800" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/805330ff-02de-4ccb-b5d2-7351fce375d0_3829x2103.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:800,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F805330ff-02de-4ccb-b5d2-7351fce375d0_3829x2103.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F805330ff-02de-4ccb-b5d2-7351fce375d0_3829x2103.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F805330ff-02de-4ccb-b5d2-7351fce375d0_3829x2103.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F805330ff-02de-4ccb-b5d2-7351fce375d0_3829x2103.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>To the victor go the spoils and these companies are rewarded with abundant capital, enviable brand recognition, and an easier time attracting candidates.

That should include getting aligned on the role and its responsibilities, writing your job description, deciding who will be on your interview panel and the order of interviews, prepping each interviewer for what they&#8217;re looking for, and making sure everyone&#8217;s on the same page.</p><p>Then it&#8217;s critical to sell, sell, sell. The game has changed when it comes to recruiting. The first call with a candidate is no longer an interview; it instead needs to be 100% focused on setting the hook. Hiring managers should prepare by putting together pitch materials (usually a 2-3 page deck) to give candidates a deeper look at your company and culture &#8211; beyond what&#8217;s on your website. Send that to candidates before the interview so they can review it and start getting excited about the opportunity.&nbsp;</p><p>Your ability to sell hinges on your ability to foster a workplace culture where people actually want to work according to <a href="https://podcast.openviewpartners.com/public/32/OV-%7C-BUILD-21cbd466/4745281f">Postscript Co-Founder &amp; CEO Adam Turner</a>.

Expect deep dive takes on SaaS pricing, product-led growth, public company benchmarks, and much more.</em></p><p>In an emerging PLG business, especially one that initially sells into a single user rather than a team or entire organization, churn can be one of the biggest inhibitors to long-term growth. </p><p>I&#8217;ve seen annualized retention rates in PLG businesses range considerably from 50% to upwards of 90%. When retention falls on the lower end of that range, it puts tremendous pressure on a company&#8217;s ability to keep accelerating new logo acquisition and to squeeze as much as possible out of the customers who stay. </p><p>It&#8217;s easy to dismiss churn as a Customer Success problem that just requires additional bodies. Here&#8217;s the thing: much of the churn happens within a user&#8217;s first 3-6 months (below is a real life example), which means SaaS companies need to get their customers to see value extremely quickly. It can be extremely tough to win a customer over if they stumbled out of the gate. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04aeeab8-a3dc-4828-908b-ade1f3a6dd54_905x644.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04aeeab8-a3dc-4828-908b-ade1f3a6dd54_905x644.png" width="469" height="333.7414364640884" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/04aeeab8-a3dc-4828-908b-ade1f3a6dd54_905x644.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:644,&quot;width&quot;:905,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:469,&quot;bytes&quot;:48886,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04aeeab8-a3dc-4828-908b-ade1f3a6dd54_905x644.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04aeeab8-a3dc-4828-908b-ade1f3a6dd54_905x644.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04aeeab8-a3dc-4828-908b-ade1f3a6dd54_905x644.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04aeeab8-a3dc-4828-908b-ade1f3a6dd54_905x644.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>Ultimately making customers succeed is a business-wide responsibility that requires contributions from each function. And the work starts well before the customer starts paying. </p><p>Here are 8 things that can really move the needle on churn. Pro-tip: focus on 2-3 things to start rather than jumping into all 8 at once. </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/how-to-stop-churn?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/how-to-stop-churn?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><h2>1. Selling to the right customer</h2><p>Target your proactive sales and marketing to the right ideal customer profile (ICP) rather than attempt to sell to everyone and their brother. If you focus on where your product does best and then carefully expand from a position of strength, you&#8217;ll be much more successful in the long run.</p><p>Now, this doesn&#8217;t mean you should stop selling to customers outside of your ICP. It&#8217;s a question of resource prioritization and where you&#8217;re being proactive. Think about what content you write, which conferences you&#8217;ll go to, where you put your paid advertising spend, and which sign-ups get extra support. </p><h2>2. Not getting too greedy on the initial deal</h2><p>Over promise, under deliver. That&#8217;s exactly what happens when your sales team captures so much extra stuff in the initial deal in an attempt to get every last dollar out of the customer. Doing too much at once can actually stop customers from being successful&#8212;and then they&#8217;ll start looking elsewhere for a solution.</p><p>Don&#8217;t get greedy&#8212;start smaller, give the customer some time to get to know the product, and you&#8217;ll be setting the stage for an easy growth opportunity in the future. This can also mean landing a customer on a pay-as-you-go plan before shifting them to a committed subscription. </p><h2>3. Moving from monthly to annual plans</h2><p>One portfolio company I work with spent years trying to improve churn. The most important lever was shifting 70% of new cohorts from monthly to annual plans.</p><p>This is controversial. Doesn&#8217;t this contradict #2? Doesn&#8217;t this just make customers who want to churn feel trapped? While this could happen in certain instances, on the whole you&#8217;re usually better off because:</p><ul><li><p>You&#8217;ll have more time to impress the customer</p></li><li><p>The customer will have more skin in the game, which will make them more motivated to implement the product</p></li></ul><h2>4. Market to existing customers</h2><p>Marketing and sales shouldn&#8217;t stop once someone becomes a customer. Customers need to know about new features (and feel excited about them), learn best practices, and understand how the product can be used and what makes it worth spending money on so they can defend the spend to their leadership team.</p><p>And they also need to feel like they&#8217;re connected to something bigger than just the product, like a supportive community that helps them learn and get better at their job. Keep this in mind when you&#8217;re creating marketing content: highlight your most successful customers in order to educate and inspire your not-yet-successful customers.</p><h2>5. Nailing customer onboarding</h2><p>Seeing value fast is critical for a customer staying engaged.</p><p>At the beginning of their time with the product, you have their greatest attention. They have a pain point that they&#8217;re looking to solve and this is your key window to impress them. Don&#8217;t mess it up.</p><p>Most SaaS companies guide users towards &#8220;activation&#8221;&#8212;the moment when your product has delivered on its promise to your users. This should happen as quickly as possible. The product team should be responsible for making sure a larger and larger share of your users reaches activation.</p><h2>6. Integrations, integrations, integrations</h2><p>The more your product is embedded in a customer&#8217;s workflow and systems of record, the harder you&#8217;ll be to rip out.</p><p>Three reasons why this is the case:</p><ul><li><p>Data aspect: Data is connected across systems and lives in multiple places</p></li><li><p>Adoption aspect: It&#8217;s easier for people to use your product since it&#8217;s available inside the applications where they already spend time</p></li><li><p>Use cases: Your product solves more problems for a customer when it&#8217;s connected to other software vs. just playing in it&#8217;s own silo</p></li></ul><h2>7. Broadening the use cases for your product</h2><p>The more problems you solve for your customer, the more champions you&#8217;ll have.</p><p>Ideally, your product should have layers like an onion. The outer layer is what brings people in. Take Zoom, for example. People may initially sign up because they need a video conferencing tool for remote work. But over time, they discover more and more layers for themselves and their teams: it&#8217;s a tool for brainstorming, meeting scheduling, group discussions, and even IT troubleshooting because of the remote desktop control.</p><h2>8. Measuring product health indicators</h2><p>Do you know what features are predictive of retention? Unless you&#8217;re Amazon, Instacart or Zoom, you need to assess your customers&#8217; engagement with your product.</p><p>Since it&#8217;s not possible to speak with every customer to understand how they think about your product, you need your product to tell you whether your customers are truly seeing value&#8212;or if they want to leave.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://kylepoyar.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://kylepoyar.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h2>Here&#8217;s what else I&#8217;m thinking about this week:</h2><ul><li><p>GitLab IPO-ed at a $16B+ valuation.

This means recurring <em>subscription</em> revenue, right? </p><p>Not necessarily.<br><br>Toast defines ARR as the sum of (1) 12x the subscription MRR &amp; (2) 4x the trailing three-month cumulative consumption payments component of MRR. They believe this metric helps control for short-term fluctuations in payments volume. </p><p>Three SaaS revenue streams are exploding, but aren't truly recurring.<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a> These are usage-based revenue, marketplace fees, and payments revenue (side note: HubSpot just announced a <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/hubspot-stock-rises-on-new-payment-system-developed-with-stripe/">new payments system</a> as of Tuesday). </p><p>But SaaS companies are starting to include this non-subscription revenue as part of their ARR. I think that's a good thing as long as the following are true.</p><ul><li><p>It acts like it&#8217;s recurring. Net revenue retention should be &gt;100%.</p></li><li><p>It&#8217;s margin-accretive. Device / hardware fees or services revenue usually fail this test.</p></li><li><p>It&#8217;s predictable in the aggregate. Some seasonality is fine and there will certainly be spikes at the individual customer level. Data-centric finance teams tend to get better and better at these predictions over time.</p></li><li><p>You are transparent and consistent with how you report it. It&#8217;s important for folks to understand the potential for growth and profitability in each of these revenue streams.</p></li></ul><p>Where you may land is a newer definition that ARR = annualized revenue run-rate including contractual subscriptions, software usage revenue, marketplace revenue, and FinTech revenue.</p><div><hr></div><p>&#128179; <strong>Vertical SaaS + FinTech = &#128150;</strong><br><br>Is Toast a software company, a FinTech company, or a hardware company? Yes.<br><br>Of Toast's $823M in 2020 revenue, only 12% came from subscriptions while 78% came from FinTech and 8% from hardware.<br><br>They've processed &gt;$38 BILLION in gross payment volume &amp; Toast generates transaction fees on these payments. </p><p>FinTech revenue appears to be broader than payments, too. Through Toast Capital, they even generate revenue from fees earned marketing &amp; servicing working capital loans.</p><p>Take note: only Toast's subscription services are high margin.</p><ul><li><p>Software subscriptions: 67% GM</p></li><li><p>FinTech: 22% GM</p></li><li><p>Hardware: -4% GM</p></li></ul><p>Based on this margin profile, I suspect that Toast will be aggressively pursuing two actions in order to maintain a high revenue multiple: (1) increase high-margin software subscription revenue as quickly as possible &amp; (2) improve the margin profile of its FinTech business. More on #1 in the next section. </p><div><hr></div><p>&#128105;&#8205;&#128187; <strong>A hardware company can't be PLG... can it?</strong><br><br>Once Toast gets a customer to adopt its POS system (and affiliated hardware), there is a tremendous opportunity to cross-sell additional software products over time. In fact, the company sells a dizzying array of software products to help customers run their restaurants efficiently, grow their business online, manage a productive team, and attract &amp; retain guests. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0445630-50fb-48f0-b024-1051de33e181_883x473.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0445630-50fb-48f0-b024-1051de33e181_883x473.png" width="701" height="375.50736126840314" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d0445630-50fb-48f0-b024-1051de33e181_883x473.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:473,&quot;width&quot;:883,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:701,&quot;bytes&quot;:100571,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0445630-50fb-48f0-b024-1051de33e181_883x473.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0445630-50fb-48f0-b024-1051de33e181_883x473.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0445630-50fb-48f0-b024-1051de33e181_883x473.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0445630-50fb-48f0-b024-1051de33e181_883x473.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>That&#8217;s where product-led growth (PLG) comes in. </p><p>Toast refers to product-led growth three times in its S-1.

For every 10 additional points to a company&#8217;s NPS scores, there&#8217;s only a 0.9% higher logo retention rate. For statistics nerds out there, the R-squared is only 0.038, which means that NPS only explains 3.8% of the variance in logo retention rates across SaaS companies.</p><p>The correlation is even weaker when comparing NPS scores and net dollar retention rates. For every 10 additional points to a company&#8217;s NPS, there&#8217;s just a 0.55% higher net dollar retention. The R-squared is a measly 0.0053.</p><p>Now, to state the obvious, this analysis is comparing across all different kinds of SaaS companies and ignores a number of potentially confounding factors such as the size of the SaaS company, their target customer, and their product market.</p><p>Even still, it doesn&#8217;t look good for NPS and I think that&#8217;s because there are all sorts of measurement issues with collecting NPS data. Just off the top of my head those include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Low response rates.</strong> Even when measured in-app, response rates for NPS surveys aren&#8217;t all that great.</p></li><li><p><strong>Different sampling approaches.</strong> Who in the account do you send the NPS survey to&#8212;the economic buyer, the champion, the individual users, all of the above? Which accounts do you send the NPS survey to&#8212;everyone or only those who&#8217;ve implemented the product? Who sends the survey&#8212;the sales rep, an independent third party?</p></li><li><p><strong>Data manipulation.</strong> At this point, NPS is such a well known and widely adopted metric that it&#8217;s particularly prone to manipulation from respondents.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sensitivity. </strong>By the nature of how NPS scores are calculated (i.e. subtracting detractors from promoters), they&#8217;re extremely sensitive to slightly different scores. Every 5 or 6 can have a radical impact on the overall score. NPS scores tend to fluctuate quite a bit month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter for no great reason.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lack of relevance. </strong>Let&#8217;s face it: some categories of products just aren&#8217;t casually recommended to friends or colleagues (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/7zupze/how_likely_are_you_to_recommend_windows_10_to_a/">Windows 10, anyone?</a>).</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://kylepoyar.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://kylepoyar.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p></li></ul><h2>Moving past NPS</h2><p>It&#8217;s certainly fine to track NPS, but let&#8217;s be realistic about what it tells us and what it doesn&#8217;t. You should think of NPS as a thermometer, but not a diagnostic tool. It can be useful to know your temperature, but it doesn&#8217;t always correlate with being sick or well.</p><p>You should always read the qualitative feedback behind the second NPS question, the why. This can be an untapped pool of input about the product that&#8217;s generated while someone is actually using the product.</p><p>And NPS needs to be complemented with other metrics that better predict customer satisfaction, advocacy and stickiness. Here are five KPIs to add to your list.</p><ol><li><p><strong>ACTUAL referrals. </strong>NPS scores are a measurement of intention, not action. NPS quantifies how many customers would be likely to refer a product to their friends or colleagues. Why not measure what percentage of customers have actually made a referral and the average number of referrals per customer? Perhaps NPS surveys could be replaced (or supplemented) with actually asking a customer for a referral? This could also be as simple as changing the NPS question from &#8220;would you recommend us&#8221; to &#8220;have you recommended us to anyone in the last 3 months?&#8221;</p></li><li><p><strong>Customer health score. </strong>Defining a customer health score is by no means new, but it&#8217;s often under-appreciated and neglected. When set up thoughtfully, customer health scores can strongly predict a customer&#8217;s likelihood to churn well before they actually churn. They can also be refreshed in real-time across all customers, not just a select few who answer an NPS survey. Let&#8217;s redirect some time and resources away from NPS and towards creating a best-in-class customer health score. <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/customer-health-assessment/">Here&#8217;s how to do it</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>CSAT. </strong>While the metric has gone out of style, you could simply ask your customers how satisfied they are (happy / sad / neutral). This simple and visual question can yield much better response rates and serve as a useful input into the customer health score.</p></li><li><p><strong>Product stickiness.</strong> One useful emerging metric is to ask customers how <a href="https://www.priceintelligently.com/blog/sean-ellis-on-scaling-authentic-growth">disappointed</a> they would be if they could no longer use your product. Would they be &#8220;very disappointed,&#8221; &#8220;somewhat disappointed,&#8221; &#8220;not at all,&#8221; or &#8220;N/A&#8212;already stopped using it&#8221;? If 40% or more of your customers would be &#8220;very disappointed&#8221; without your product, you&#8217;re on the right track. This is a great measurement of product stickiness and product-market fit.</p></li><li><p><strong>ROI delivered. </strong>Roll up your sleeves to ultimately tie an ROI to your product that&#8217;s so compelling your customer never wants to leave. An added bonus is that you can repurpose these ROI studies for case studies and sales collateral.</p></li></ol><p><em>This post was originally published on the OpenView <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/cant-we-do-better-than-nps/">blog</a>.</em></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[You can't win]]></title><description><![CDATA[How Freshworks rewrote the traditional SaaS growth playbook]]></description><link>https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/you-cant-win</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/you-cant-win</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Kyle Poyar]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 10:26:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F199ce67b-434d-434b-bfe5-41e9c33acec2_1912x777.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#128075;&nbsp;<em>Hi, I&#8217;m&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-poyar/">Kyle</a>&nbsp;and welcome to my newsletter,&nbsp;<a href="https://kylepoyar.substack.com/">Growth Unhinged</a>.

First among them was that legacy vendors weren&#8217;t <em>purpose-built to meet users&#8217; needs</em>.</p><p>Freshworks&#8217; user is the frontline employee who&#8217;s interacting with customers everyday. These folks have come to expect consumer-like experiences similar to what they used in their personal lives. </p><p>But existing vendors have designed their products for executive buyers at the expense of frontline employees. Other products struggle with &#8220;complexity, feature bloat, and complicated user interfaces (UI) that often require extensive and ongoing training for users.&#8221; Sound familiar?</p><p>Even though the Freshworks buyer is likely not the same individual as the frontline employee, Freshworks recognized that <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/what-is-product-led-growth/#.YT9XDZ1KguU">end users are becoming increasingly important constituents in software buying</a>.

The top channels they highlight in their S-1 are search marketing and word of mouth, both aimed to &#8220;encourage individual users or small teams within an organization to discover, try, and purchase our products.&#8221;</p><p>In addition to traditional blogs and eBooks, Freshworks&#8217; organic marketing strategy includes a marketplace, academy, and community forum (great for user-generated content):</p><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.freshworks.com/apps/">Marketplace</a>: </strong>Features &gt;1,000 pre-built apps to quickly customize Freshworks.

Many investors have a pre-determined hurdle rate of, say, 3x or 4x probability-weighted return multiple on invested capital. In other words, they&#8217;re looking to triple their money on a risk-adjusted basis.</p><p>There are two factors that go into a probability-weighted expected return:</p><ol><li><p><em>Potential risk &amp; uncertainty</em> - i.e. what&#8217;s the likelihood that the company achieves an attractive outcome vs. falls flat; how much uncertainty is there about the likelihood of different outcomes based on what we know and don&#8217;t know.</p></li><li><p><em>Potential upside</em> - i.e. what&#8217;s the outcome if the company were to go public or get acquired in an upside scenario.</p></li></ol><p>Let&#8217;s start with risk &amp; uncertainty. In general, SaaS companies have shown to be far less risky than many initially thought. The COVID-19 pandemic proved the durability of SaaS despite economic shutdowns and a global recession. </p><p>And uncertainty has decreased as folks have become more comfortable with the buying market and SaaS economic models. Many - if not most - SaaS companies have solid underlying economic models including net negative churn.  As my colleague Sean Fanning wrote in OpenView&#8217;s <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/expansion-saas-benchmarks/#.YRvtc45Khm9">2020 SaaS benchmarks report</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>SaaS companies are getting better and at the same time folks better understand B2B markets, unit economics and payback periods are more clearly defined, and overall future price uncertainty of the assets seems to be reduced. This has created exuberance in the market. </em></p></blockquote><p>Now onto upside. The ultimate successful outcome in SaaS is for a company to go public, offering liquidity to early investors (as well as the LPs of these investors). </p><p>But the IPO is just the beginning for top SaaS companies. Many SaaS companies have increased their valuation by 10x (Zoom), 20x (Atlassian), 30x (Twilio &amp; HubSpot), or much more (looking at you, Shopify) after their IPO. </p><p>Let&#8217;s take a look at some examples:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71a6917b-1b58-445f-88f6-8fd676f69011_1010x448.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71a6917b-1b58-445f-88f6-8fd676f69011_1010x448.png" width="1010" height="448" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/71a6917b-1b58-445f-88f6-8fd676f69011_1010x448.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:448,&quot;width&quot;:1010,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:128709,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71a6917b-1b58-445f-88f6-8fd676f69011_1010x448.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71a6917b-1b58-445f-88f6-8fd676f69011_1010x448.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71a6917b-1b58-445f-88f6-8fd676f69011_1010x448.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71a6917b-1b58-445f-88f6-8fd676f69011_1010x448.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/the-haves-and-have-nots-of-saas?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/the-haves-and-have-nots-of-saas?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p>We can debate the sanity of the public markets all day.

Most respondents were in the expansion stage (48% had $1-10M in ARR), although there are also a good number of later stage companies in the mix (19% had over $30M in ARR).</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5910eb77-dc3c-4b75-a11c-4f2185bdd2d7_500x266.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5910eb77-dc3c-4b75-a11c-4f2185bdd2d7_500x266.png" width="500" height="266" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5910eb77-dc3c-4b75-a11c-4f2185bdd2d7_500x266.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:266,&quot;width&quot;:500,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:156639,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5910eb77-dc3c-4b75-a11c-4f2185bdd2d7_500x266.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5910eb77-dc3c-4b75-a11c-4f2185bdd2d7_500x266.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5910eb77-dc3c-4b75-a11c-4f2185bdd2d7_500x266.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5910eb77-dc3c-4b75-a11c-4f2185bdd2d7_500x266.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p>You can&#8217;t miss the key headline: <em>as PLG becomes trendy, product-led imposters are on the rise. </em>I highly recommend exploring the <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/2021-product-benchmarks/">full report</a> to see for yourself.</p><p>As with any of these reports, there&#8217;s so much data that it can be easy to overlook some of the most interesting insights.

Companies are newly flush with VC funding, have ambitious revenue targets to hit, and have a precious window ahead of Q4 when they can focus on strategic initiatives. </p><p>Here&#8217;s the rub: the average SaaS company doesn&#8217;t have anyone on their team who&#8217;s an expert in pricing, let alone a <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/saas-pricing-insights">dedicated pricing function</a>. </p><p>Companies are then left with a tough choice. Do they try to run a pricing project in-house with their existing team, knowing that it might not produce the optimal outcome? Or do they outsource pricing to an external consultant, which may take months to complete and set them back $150,000-$500,000 in fees?</p><p>I&#8217;d love to see more companies build an in-house pricing process that becomes a source of sustainable revenue growth and competitive advantage in the market. </p><p>To help, I&#8217;m opening up about how I like to run pricing projects. Read on for a step-by-step guide and you might want to bookmark this handy pricing project <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1khYJzqnjtAcDY-LbOlIu2MJSXiODRsiOWXqrktkYBZY/edit#gid=0">checklist</a>. </p><p><strong>The step-by-step guide for running a pricing project </strong></p><p>There are four high-level phases of any pricing project: (1) setting the strategy, (2) validating with customer research, (3) preparing for implementation, (4) following through post-launch. </p><p>Going through steps 1-3 could take as little as a few weeks or as long as 6+ months depending on the magnitude of the change that a company is contemplating. Within each stage, there are a number of workstreams that are required and others that may be optional depending on the situation. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F765af72d-654c-4f31-9a8a-6c86ac0db418_612x792.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F765af72d-654c-4f31-9a8a-6c86ac0db418_612x792.png" width="510" height="660" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/765af72d-654c-4f31-9a8a-6c86ac0db418_612x792.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:792,&quot;width&quot;:612,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:510,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Pricing project checklist&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Pricing project checklist" title="Pricing project checklist" srcset="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F765af72d-654c-4f31-9a8a-6c86ac0db418_612x792.png 424w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F765af72d-654c-4f31-9a8a-6c86ac0db418_612x792.png 848w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F765af72d-654c-4f31-9a8a-6c86ac0db418_612x792.png 1272w, https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F765af72d-654c-4f31-9a8a-6c86ac0db418_612x792.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></a></figure></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/how-to-run-a-pricing-project?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/how-to-run-a-pricing-project?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p>Let&#8217;s dive in to each step.</p><p><em>&#65279;Step 1: Setting the strategy </em></p><p>The goals of this phase are to get buy-in about prioritizing pricing as a cross-functional initiative as well as to generate alignment about what needs to change and why. Key workstreams in Step 1:</p><ul><li><p><em>Crisply state the goals of the pricing strategy</em>, i.e. "increase volume of our lowest priced products" or "increase revenue per customer given the value of our products." These should come from the executive team and align with company-wide OKRs.</p></li><li><p><em>Appoint a project manager to own and manage the pricing process</em>. This person typically sits in Product, Product Marketing, or Business Operations.</p></li><li><p><em>Conduct internal interviews with executives and customer-facing employees</em> to understand what's working / not working. I highly recommend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6813099294321627136/">involving sellers</a> in these conversations. Not only are they closest to the customer in talking about your current pricing, their buy-in is make-or-break to the success of any changes you want to make.  </p></li><li><p><em>Assess competitive pricing and packaging models</em>. Sometimes this information is readily available through public pricing pages or analyst reports. It might also take some digging through win-loss data, Gong recordings, or other inputs. Don&#8217;t just look at the current pricing, but instead evaluate how pricing has evolved over time (the Wayback Machine is an awesome tool) and how buyers respond to it.</p></li><li><p><em>Collect benchmarks</em> on how companies in adjacent spaces have changed pricing. VCs can be a great place for this information and/or for making introductions to other portfolio companies that have recently changed pricing.  </p></li><li><p><em>Analyze pricing data</em>. This usually includes sales KPIs (win/loss including win-loss reasons, conversion rates by segment, package mix by segment, average discounts by plan and by customer size), customer behavior (churn rate by plan, NDR by plan, NDR by ACV), and product engagement (utilization by feature).</p></li></ul><p>By the end of Step 1, a company should have honed in on a strategic direction for future pricing changes and the leadership team should be aligned about why these changes are important. Now it&#8217;s time to figure out the details. </p><p><em>&#65279;Step 2: Validating with customer research</em></p><p>Any strategy needs to be validated with actual input from customers. While this input could come from running pilots or simply changing pricing and seeing what happens, customer research is a great way to de-risk decisions and generate more buy-in for pricing changes. Key workstreams in Step 2:</p><ul><li><p><em>Conduct voice-of-customer research</em> (qualitative interviews and/or an online survey) on perceived value and willingness to pay. This research shouldn&#8217;t be positioned as &#8220;pricing research&#8221;, but rather include pricing-related questions as part of a broader conversation about the customer&#8217;s buying process, the value/ROI they&#8217;ve seen, what additional capabilities they&#8217;d like to see, and what they&#8217;d like to see improved about their experience. I recommend that this research include a healthy cross-section of accounts, ideally including either lost prospects or churned customers rather than just those who are already happy.</p></li><li><p><em>Translate voice-of-customer findings into specific recommendations</em> about pricing and packaging changes.</p></li><li><p><em>Quantify the expected financial impact</em> of the new pricing on new and existing customers. Ideally look at this financial impact on a customer-by-customer level, mapping how much customers would pay if they were migrated into the new packages and pricing.</p></li><li><p><em>Socialize findings and recommendations</em> with the pricing council and get a go / no go decision.</p></li><li><p><em>Set up weekly cross-functional meetings</em> to align on pricing decisions and coordinate implementation.</p></li></ul><p>The team at Cypress took a particularly in-depth approach to customer research as they contemplated launching usage-based pricing earlier this year. I recommend reading about <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/cypress-usage-based-pricing/">their pricing playbook</a> if you&#8217;d like to learn more about Step 2.</p><p><em>&#65279;Step 3: Preparing for implementation</em></p><p>As challenging as Steps 1 &amp; 2 can feel, Step 3 ends up being the most resource intensive, especially if a company is contemplating a significant pricing change. Key workstreams in Step 3:</p><ul><li><p><em>Build final price list, package names, and business rules.</em> Get formal approval from the pricing council. </p></li><li><p><em>Decide on business rules for existing customers</em> -- i.e. keep on current plans perpetually; keep on current plans with limits; offer carrots / incentives to move to new plans; migrate to new plans. Consider an exceptions process for customers that don&#8217;t fit neatly into these business rules.</p></li><li><p><em>Pilot the new pricing </em>via a sub-set of the sales team prior to widespread launch. (Optional)</p></li><li><p><em>Create a communication plan &#8211; both internally and externally</em>. Emphasize the benefits that this model brings to customers / why it's in their best interest. As part of this communication plan, decide whether / how to use the new pricing as a marketing tactic with existing deals (&#8220;the price is changing soon&#8230; lock in your rate now&#8221;).</p></li><li><p><em>Decide on exact launch dates</em> (go live date, date when you no longer honor existing quotes - usually give prospects ~30 days).</p></li><li><p><em>Define the appropriate pricing KPIs to monitor </em>(average revenue per customer, conversion rates through the funnel, customer support requests, plan mix, NDR, etc.).</p></li><li><p><em>Review potential billing / invoicing limitations within existing systems</em>. These potential limitations should have also been considered when contemplating what pricing changes to make in the first place. Then implement new SKUs / pricing models into billing (and/or CPQ as needed).</p></li><li><p><em>Publish rate card and discount rules for the sales team. </em>Conduct sales / CS training on the new pricing (talk track for the new pricing, FAQs, responding to potential objections, etc.).</p></li><li><p><em>Build and iterate on new pricing page design</em>; ideally collect usability / UX feedback from folks in the target market or lean on Sales as a beta tester.</p></li><li><p><em>Update financial plans / forecasts </em>(as needed) -- pricing changes could have an impact on revenue recognition and cash flow (annual plans).</p></li></ul><p><em>&#65279;Step 4: Following through post-launch</em></p><p>Pricing work doesn&#8217;t end at implementation. It&#8217;s important to follow-through post launch to ensure pricing changes are being effectively implemented and generating the desired impact. Key workstreams in Step 4:</p><ul><li><p><em>Report on the appropriate pricing KPIs</em> decided in Step 3 (average revenue per customer, conversion rates through the funnel, customer support requests, plan mix, NDR, etc.).</p></li><li><p><em>Update the pricing council</em> with post-launch retrospective emails and/or meetings (i.e. 7 days out, 14 days out, 30 days out, 60 days out, 90 days out). Initially companies should look at early signals or leading indicators. Over time there will be a richer set of data that provides a complete picture on the impact of pricing changes.</p></li><li><p><em>Monitor response post-implementation and conduct follow up sales / CS training(s)</em> as needed. It may take extra coaching and time for the new pricing to land across the team.</p></li></ul><p>Pro-tip: if the pricing change was a success, let people know! That will increase the team&#8217;s confidence in pitching and defending the new pricing going forward. This data will also help inform future pricing changes. For example, if a company raised prices by 25% and conversion rates stayed the same, that&#8217;s a powerful signal that there&#8217;s additional room to raise prices in the future.</p><p><strong>Wrap up</strong></p><p>I won&#8217;t sugar coat it; pricing changes require a lot of work from many different teams across a company. But running a pricing process in-house gets easier the second time (and the third time) once a company has a solid foundation. And this hard work does eventually <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/the-unspoken-impact-of-pricing-changes/">pay off in spades</a>. </p><p>I hope this post helped to demystify the pricing process and enabled folks to make more informed pricing decisions. </p><p><em>Still curious about how to run a pricing project in-house?

Doing so takes a strong commitment from the top and the patience to invest before seeing immediate results. Here are just a few potential stumbling blocks that might lie ahead.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Lack of internal DNA and skills: </strong>Enterprise-centered products thrive on complexity and product completeness; checking every requirement on the RFP. PLG is all about time to value and simplifying the product experience down to its core. The team that built your existing business might not be the team that can transform it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lack of internal buy-in: </strong>It&#8217;s hard to make the case to invest product &amp; engineering resources into a self-service motion when the lion&#8217;s share of ARR comes from large enterprise customers whose requirements are too complex for a touchless purchase.

But in 2019 they made a bet on PLG, self-service, and usage-based pricing.</p><p>It started small with only two engineers. Many folks couldn&#8217;t understand devoting resources to fund something that&#8217;s counter to what large Enterprises were demanding.</p><p>The first self-service launch was a true MVP. Everything outside of the basics, like using the Stripe plug-in to process credit cards, was done manually in the early days. </p><p>But getting self-service out allowed Logz.io to quickly iterate. The difference in scale of having the data from 400 to 500 signups each week versus 100 sales per quarter allowed them to optimize everything from marketing campaigns to onboarding flows to the entry price point. </p><p>One of their learnings was that offering a consumption-based or pay-as-you-go model helped reduce conversion friction. Customers were able to purchase Logz.io without needing to guess what their future usage needs might be. Instead they had the confidence that they&#8217;d only pay if they were successful with the product.</p><p>Fast forward to today. 50% of new customers come in via self-service, up from 0% in just a year. Self-service customers are much more valuable than expected and demonstrate 300% net dollar retention. </p><p>Importantly, self-service has not proved to be anti-sales. 10% of self-service sign-ups become enterprise opportunities, increasing pipeline for sales. This allows Logz.io to spend even more on marketing to create more awareness, knowing that the awareness will directly pay off via self-service revenue and eventually generate bonus enterprise upside.</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Ultimately, we are after the enterprise customer,&#8221; Co-Founder Asaf Yigal told me. &#8220;But if we increase spend to create more awareness, that awareness is going to bring in more enterprise customers alongside the self-service customers. And we know that it will be money well spent, because we&#8217;re basically increasing the spend without incurring any cost to the business. We know that if we spend another million, it will bring us much more.&#8221;  </em></p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/yes-you-can-pivot-to-product-led?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/yes-you-can-pivot-to-product-led?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Stack Overflow secures an $85M Series E on the back of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/stack-overflow-adds-a-free-tier-to-its-fast-growing-teams-service/">PLG transformation</a></strong></p><p>When Prashanth Chandrasekar took the reins as CEO of Stack Overflow in 2019, he vowed to lead the company on a product-led SaaS transformation.

They each had a strong community presence and appealed to a tech-savvy audience that wants to jump straight into a product, no friction required. </p><p>You might come to PLG from a completely different angle. To get started, investigate where you have the biggest gaps or wasted resources in <em>your </em>current go-to-market approach. These wasted resources typically fall into one of four buckets:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Not enough leads: </strong>You spend a fortune on paid marketing and outbound sales only to see anemic growth. How can your product become a marketing engine?</p></li><li><p><strong>Low conversion: </strong>On the flip side, you might find miniscule conversion from website visitor to closed won customer. How can a PLG approach both increase and accelerate your conversion rate?</p></li><li><p><strong>High churn: </strong>Despite all of the best intentions of your Customer Success team, some businesses see high churn rates and don&#8217;t understand why. How can PLG lead to more sustained product engagement, and therefore better retention?</p></li><li><p><strong>Poor upsell/cross-sell: </strong>You might find that you&#8217;ve built a number of monetizable products, but customers are stuck using only one or two. How can PLG drive trial and adoption of new capabilities? </p></li></ul><p>By connecting your PLG efforts to your most important business priorities, you can gain more buy-in across the organization and generate quicker wins from your work. Doing so also narrows the scope of your PLG investments so that you can make incremental progress with only a lean team.</p><p>An executive sponsor is required in most cases. This ensures the PLG initiative gets visibility, access to resources, and a strong advocate when trade-off decisions are made. The executive sponsor could come from many different parts of the organization; it doesn&#8217;t necessarily need to just be a Product Leader. Sometimes this is the CEO, other times the CTO, CMO, or even CRO.</p><p>From there you&#8217;ll want to carve out a cross-functional team to own your PLG efforts. At a minimum this should usually include a Growth Product Manager, Product Marketer, Designer, and an Analyst. </p><p>Your PLG team will need to be scrappy in the early days, looking for experiments that can be shipped quickly even if they aren&#8217;t designed for scale. The goal is to generate learnings as fast as possible to help you steadily improve and make the most of a small team.</p><p>The value of patience cannot be overstated. In time, your hard work will eventually pay off as one successful experiment builds on top of another. But you cannot expect the results to automatically appear in the first two quarters.</p><p>Don&#8217;t lose faith or worry that embracing PLG a fool&#8217;s errand. The results speak for themselves.</p><blockquote><p><em>Do you have other favorite PLG transformation stories?
