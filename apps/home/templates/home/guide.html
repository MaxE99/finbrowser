        While FinTech is a subset of the broader tech category, there's so much incredible coverage on this topic that I
        had to give it its own dedicated space. It's no surprise considering how much FinTech has boomed in the past
        decade, completely transforming the financial industry. The younger generation is all about FinTech, ditching
        traditional financial institutions for innovative options. This shift is definitely here to stay. Given how
        disruptive this industry is, it's important to not just focus on the big FinTech players, but also keep an eye
        on the up-and-coming unicorn startups that are shaping the field. I highly recommend checking out the
        thought-provoking long-form articles from <img src="{{ cloudfront_dist }}home/favicons/fintech-brain-food.webp"

    <div class="desc">These days, it's common for most new investors to start out in the tech sector. But it wasn't
        always like that. Back in the day, many new investors cut their teeth in the small-cap sector. While some lost
        their hard-earned money, those who persisted and learned the ropes became some of the most well-known investors.
        Small-cap stocks don't receive as much coverage from financial analysts, which means there's a greater
        opportunity to uncover hidden gems or potential disasters. Fortunately, writers on Substack, such as

        Moving from small caps, let's dive into an even smaller realm: semiconductors (not the smoothest transition, I
        admit). The recent pandemic has
        underscored the criticality of semiconductors for the global economy. It's no wonder
        that experts often refer to them as the "oil" of the 21st century. As an investor, it's imperative to stay
        informed about this industry. Fortunately, there is a wealth of excellent sources covering the sector. You may
